Introduction course to the minor (6 EC)

* [Digital Humanities and Social Analytics](https://minor.vu.nl/en/programmes-a-z/digital-humanities-and-social-analytics/index.aspx) - description of the full minor course

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To be able to run the notebooks, it is needed to have Anaconda (Python 3 in specific) installed. 

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) - Installing page for Anaconda


From there on use pip as below to install the libraries mentioned in the notebook (if not installed yet)

```
pip install --user *LIBRARY NEEDED*
```

Like for example with pandas

```
pip install --user pandas
```

## Running the notebook

To be able to run the notebooks, open up jupyter notebook by (make sure you're in the right folder in the terminal where you want to open the notebook):

```
jupyter notebook
```

## Deployment

The CSV's are already made, if anyone is interested in how this is done, see the cells that are fully commented. 

Make sure when removing the hashtags and rerunning these cells to delete the csv's beforehand, otherwise this will just paste the csv's to the end of the final_csv files.

## Versioning

It is mandatory to use Python 3.6.4 to execute the cells. 

## What steps were taken?

All steps are described in detail in the research report, which can be found in the repository aswell. Any further questions, please contact the contributors.
