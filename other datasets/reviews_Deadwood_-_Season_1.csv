B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AUMXMO306WA3S	70s Girl	All I can say is that I'm glad I checked this out at my library for free before spending a single penny on it!!  I love true western movies and tv shows as well as the actors: Clint Eastwood in Joe Kidd, John Wayne in Rooster Cogburn, Robert Duvall in Lonesome Dove, Sam Elliot in all of his westerns, just to name a few.  But when the writers have to use profane language every two or three words in order to get a point across, then there's no enjoyment left.  Even trying to give the show another chance is out the window. The vulgarity and unnecessary sexual scenes in this show are just too much.  The only credit I give this show is the fact that the actors themselves, all of whom have fantastic resumes, do a superb job! It's such a shame they had to be given the embarrassing scripts they recieved when hired on for this show.  We don't need high school and college kids writing this garbage, and that's all it is!!  You would think it was a contest between them all, and someone on the sidelines was keeping score to see who could use the most digusting language each minute!! I was sick of this before the first episode was over, and am only hanging in there to watch more because my husband, who is also sick of the language, is enjoying the storyline.  I hope he gives up quickly!	1.0	Sad disappointment	2012-08-06	14	3	11
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1K56WM1R3T8OS	91 Tiger	My favorite HBO series.  Great characters.  Language is very rough so I can't watch it when our child is awake.  I really hate HBO didn't do one more season of it.	5.0	Great Show	2014-05-27	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1P4APIZD79ZQC	"97XBAM ""The Future of Roll and Roll"""	I don't even know why anyone offended by the language on the show would have HBO,but if they bought the dvd set and weren't aware of the excessive profanity and are offended by it I will buy it for 40 bucks from anyone willing to sell it for that price.For season three I plan on having a dvd recorder,only having the first two seasons on vhs. Deadwood is gritty and lifelike,you can almost taste the mud and smell the greasy food in E.B. Farnum's dining room! The characters are very multi-dimensional and complex.To balance out the profanity(which I even find excessive at times,please David Milch,get rid of that toilet mouth Trixie!)there is beautiful dialogue obviously influenced from letters from that period in time.Realistic,gritty,violent,dramatic,funny,profane,eloquent,philosophic and character driven, putting the events in history in the background,instead emphasizing the people living through them,Deadwood has it all! Too bad some people can't get past the profanity to see that.	5.0	Best Show On TV!	2005-12-24	4	4	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A236UVQMLTIXQ7	"Abby's Mom ""Abby's Mom"""	Lots of factual and many fictional stories to this series.  The language is so vulgar that I don't believe they used those words back in those days.  Some of the scenes also are so explicit that I was embarrassed to be watching it with my husband.  Because it does contain many historical facts, It is a very addicting series, if you can get past the language and the sexuality scenes.  It would be better if it was toned down to the actual language they used in those days.	3.0	x - Rated & Addicting but I would never my kids watch it	2014-05-28	1	1	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2VB2NUJECKXUA	A. Benson	The cast of Deadwood is outstanding and the set is so realistic I find myself cringing at the 'grubbiness' of these early pioneers. Ian McShane is scary evil and I never would have recognized Robin Weigert (Calamity Jane) she is so authentic in her character.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3LW8FEWEJI1ZQ	"AcuDefTechGuy ""DefTech BP7000(2) & SM450(3), ..."	I've read other reviews so I knew it would be good.But I did not know it would be that superb until I saw Deadwood on dvd.Before Deadwood, I thought Tombstone was the best Western cinema.I guess you really can't compare the two since Tombstone was a movie and Deadwood is an HBO series.But just I think Deadwood is number one. Although it lacks the star power of Tomstone (Val Kilmar, Kurt Russel, Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe, Charelton Heston, Jason Priesley, Billy Zane, and many more---pardon my spelling by the way) Deadwood has more character development and more story/plot.It looks great too. It doesn't feel like a TV series. It feels more like a big budget screen movie.Anyway, I usually don't write reviews---probably because I can't write as well as so many other people here:-)But I just wanted to say Deadwood is an excellent show.Now if only HBO can take Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and make it into a mini-series.I think high-quality (how about HDTV?) HBO series is the way to go these days.	5.0	BEST WESTERN, BEST TV, BEST CINEMA PERIOD	2005-02-24	12	9	3
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A205IY1Y4SYRHF	Adair Rowland	"This is the kind of series that makes you want to be snowbound and watch hours at a time. I thought ""The Wire"" spoiled me for storytelling as ""Carnival"" did for production values, but ""Deadwood"" has both the authentic grit and wide western feel of changing times and place. The characters are a fascinating mix of real and fictional, and even if you know your post Civil War history, every turn by Calamity Jane or a gold rush speculator comes as a surprise for how it ripples through the Deadwood world. Can't wait to get the full compilation..plus the extras are a show in themselves."	5.0	I didn't like Westerns until this brilliant series.	2011-01-08	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A29WP7XWVXYKKN	"Adam C. Donnelly ""admcdonnelly1973"""	Deadwood, the latest product from David Milch, is an intelligent, authenic and foulmouthed western that just actually may be one of the most well written shows of all time. You can put up on the same pedestal as Milch's Hill Street Blues, West Wing, X-files and the Sopranos, all of which exemplify continuously unflawed scriptwriting which is a real feat for weekly ongoing dramas. Set in the squalid, illegal town of Deadwood, South Dakota, the show recreates a hyperrealistic, gritty vision of the old west without dispensing the classic iconography and romanticism we usually associate with it. The formula is there: lawless town, the hero rides in, there's the mustached coniving villain, the damsel, the weasel, the harlot, the sidekick, the town drunk, the quick draw, the indian; everything we expect to see is there and it shows it to us in a way we can actually beleve in, it refuses to compromise the integrity of it's vision by avoiding offense to viewers. It tries very hard to recreate a time period and never glosses over 19th century life where everyone walks around in pressed, clean clothes, clean streets sitting inside under flourescent lighting instead of lanterns. Gunsmoke it ain't. It takes the classic modern western cliche and turns them into a harsh brutal reality, propelling it with some seriously guttaral, poetic 19th century dialougue. This is seriously action packed dialogue, folks, that'll rattle and richocet in your mind for awhile and the cast is just awesome across the board. Keith Carradine is tragic and powerful as the tired, burned out Wild Bill; Timothy Olyphant as the angry hero, Seth Bullock, Molly Parker as the grieving widdow and Brad Douriff is terrific as the tormented town doctor. But it's British actor Ian McShane who's the real phenomenon of the series as the Villain; the calculating, ruthless barkeep and town boss Al Swerengen, who literally, eats the set. He drives this show playing a wild character that has no qualms about killing people with his bare hands and at the same time posesses a sensitivity and obligation to helping and saving the town. McShane is one of the best actors of today and since he's spent most of his career underground, it's great that he's finally gone mainstream. It's like watching Pacino or Spacey, that sort of kinetic, riotous performance, he's that good. The show definately belongs to him. And be forewarned before you watch it. McShane say's c***sucker constantly with so much flare, so much panache and relentless audacity that you'll wind up saying it all the time too. Hey, it's catchy dialogue. (It also has the best theme song of any show.)	5.0	Ian McShane! Keith Carradine! This is the real deal!	2005-02-10	43	39	4

It's incredibly intense, the acting is perfect (mostly), the writing is top notch and it's jam packed with memorable moments and characters and quotable lines.  Probably tied with The Wire and Breaking Bad as the best TV dramas ever made.And for those who begin their negative reviews with ""I'm not a prude but..."" and then complain about the language - well, you're a prude.  Yes, there's a lot of swearing, but it's just part of the tone the show sets.  Obviously you can't watch this with children within earshot, but otherwise I've got no problem with it."	5.0	Incredibly good	2014-06-09	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2TLCFD8RE12Z1	"AGD ""Jonas Mac"""	Yes, this show is a fresh look at a tired typology, but it is evident that the profanity is an act of laziness and an attempt at constant shock value over real story-telling, I mean I understand the use of profanity now and again to suggest a greater reality, but this show just never stops, it's F-ing and C-ing all the live long day, which is a pity, because it was such a good idea, but hey, I suppose that's HBO's agenda, shock over substance, the two stars are for the high quality of acting by most of the actors, the lack of three stars is for the laziness and short-sightedness of the writers and producers.

The first one on each disc plays well as do most ""features"" on a disc but I never get the second or third episode on a disc to play immediately after watching the previous or first episode.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AZSBL66Z5J2T9	Amazon Customer	I was looking for a good western movie I hadn't seen, but not finding anything that caught my interest, I thought I'd try Deadwood.  I'm glad I did.It took me a while to get into the series.  After I watched the first episode there were no characters I really liked, even though the environments and events were good.  By the end of the third episode I realized there wasn't a character in the show I *didn't* like.One of my favorite things about the writing is the dialog.  The flowery period speech makes the show a joy to watch, and I have to confess that once in a while I have no idea what someone just said until I think through it again in my head, and that's actually a good thing.The show is famous for its profanity, there's even a website counting the times someone uses the f-word in each episode.  Profanity doesn't bother me, but even I was turned off by it in the first episode.  It almost seemed like two or maybe three phrases at most were the only ways anyone knew to express anything.  I didn't feel that way after the pilot, though.Another thing I really appreciated was their use of realistic nudity.  Much of the show takes place in and around brothels, so you have to expect to see something.  They never seemed to focus in on the nudity though, to make it the center of a scene.  I always felt like they used it responsibly and realistically, and that made the show even better, in my opinion.  It felt realistic instead of a cheap trick to keep your attention, a show for adults instead of hormonal teenagers.My only big complaint is that HBO charges quite a lot for their dramas on DVD.  A season of ~25 episodes from one of the public networks is around $55 suggested retail, a season of only 12 episodes from HBO is $99.  Twice the price for half the episodes is hard for me to justify, but Deadwood was so good it might be worth it anyway.	4.0	Excellent writing, for grown-ups	2006-10-14	4	4	0

I get giddy before it starts and depressed when it's over.  Waiting for season 2 is gruelling! Deadwood has fabulous complex character development.  People are full of the complexities that should be present for a bunch of civil war vetrans, vagrants, and the ""walking wounded"" - people who live with the trauma they've witnessed, experienced and inflicted. Also full of great lines such as, ""Get a haircut.  Looks like your mama f-ed a monkey.""  Yes, it is rife with swearing - but it suits the program.  Quite honestly I think it wouldn't be nearly as good without it! The cinemetography is stunning. But be warned - it's also extremely graphic and violent. A lawless community wouldn't be renowned for its pleasantness! While I do appreciate the lack of sugar coating and romanticizing of life's horrors like disease, prostitution and murder, I have been left with the memories of things I'd rather not have seen.

This show was so over the top with the profanity that I could not follow the storyline. I watched the first two episodes to give the show a chance, but nearly every scene contained very offensive language and a lot of it. I too am no prude (I think the Sopranos is the best show on TV). If you don't appreciate constantly hearing derogatory referrences to female anatomy parts, then this is not the show for you.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1B0ZTFJQ5VJW0	amy	My husband and I like the series Deadwood so much that I ordered the second and third seasons last night. Being a history buff I always cross reference to see how close the writer stays to facts. Deadwood follows history well, and of course there are fictional characters also. The actors truly act and look much like the characters they portray. Wild Bill (played by David Carridine) is superb, Sheriff Bullock (played by Timothy Olyphant) is excellent as are the supporting actors. I lived in South Dakota and have been to the real Deadwood many times. The set is a replica of this old miner town and the scene of Americas biggest gold rush. The ONLY problem I have is the raunchy language, explicit and vulgar as it is. I find it offensive. Overall, Deadwood is well done and I would recommend it to anyone if you can overlook the language.	5.0	Well Done	2013-08-26	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AQU3M75UF1QGO	"Andie ""Andie Dufresne"""	We ordered the season opener of this show because we are both fans and weekly viewers of &#34;Justified&#34; so we thought an older show starring Timothy Olyphant would be good too and it would have been had it not been completely filled with vile and offensive language throughout the entire show. We are not surprised or opposed to the occasional swear in shows or movies, there is no need to be because it seems in todays society it is sadly the norm, and apparently based on this show getting increasingly worse... but when a show curses so often in almost every single sentence and definitely every single scene, there is time to take notice and say enough is enough. Based on this, we did not finish watching the show nor will we be ordering any additional shows. And if no new shows can be found, we will just stick to re-watching shows like Justified, Suits, Hannibal, Supernatural and the Walking Dead because at least these shows even though they may throw out the occasional expletive, there is a fantastic story line and exemplary acting to leave the viewer fully entertained.	1.0	Terrible	2014-04-15	17	6	11

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A29Y34ALWJUGB5	"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment"""	"To be completely honest, I hate westerns. It's the city boy in me, and the fact that I'm only recently in my twenties. Most would agree that the best westerns came out in the fifties and sixties, and that's a time I just haven't had much of a care to visit (tragic, isn't it). So, when I heard HBO was going to have its own western based mostly on historical events, I was a little skeptical. So skeptical, in fact, that I didn't even watch the show during its first and second season run. It wasn't until I saw it On Demand that I became hooked.I wasn't hooked immediately, though. I was struck dumb by the graphic violence and the constant stream of profanity that spewed from the characters' mouths. I didn't appreciate the fact that the obvious main character (or scene stealer) was the proprietor of a ""brothel."" It redeemed itself, however, as the story progressed dramatically into the more historical elements. It was odd and delightful at the same time to see characters that took shape in tall tales in stark reality form: Calamity Jane, a foul-mouthed alcoholic, and Wild Bill, a brooding gambler.After that, my interest ran downhill. All the characters made their slow appearances, all of which were as unique as the next and, despite such a large cast, with an important role in the story. And the story itself, continuing from episode to episode, is filled with as much drama as comedy.The one problem I have with the series itself is the large cast I mentioned before. While I said that all the characters have a role in the story, it is difficult to grasp all the names in the series, especially when new characters are introduced in each episode. But with its release on DVD, this problem becomes non-existent. It will be difficult not to watch this series more than once.I recommend this for anyone who wants something new in their westerns, and for those who you who don't mind the reality in their TV, as HBO is known for taking advantage of their location on cable television."	5.0	Westerns Will Never Be the Same	2005-11-15	6	3	3

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	"I love Deadwood.  I love the language in Deadwood so much I watch it with Closed Captioning just so I won't miss any of it.  There is a slew of elaborate profanity mixed into some of the best self-revealing soliloquies by different characters (usually at least one per show) that, as many reviewers have pointed out, rises to an over-arching eloquence that is Shakespearian in its density.  David Milch has noted that Deadwood was known for being foul-mouthed.  Did they use the ""F"" word in the 1800's?  I don't know, and I don't care.  This Deadwood was written for our age, not that age.Just like the muddy, cruddy, yet aspiring and energetic mining town itself, the dialogue in Deadwood runs from the crudest to the most proper.  I don't know if anyone noticed, but Seth Bullock and his partner rarely curse, nor does the Newspaper editor, and of course, the widow and assorted others.  Many curse only infrequently.  The foulest mouths are the saloon/brothel owners, the prostitutes, gamblers, drunks and killers that frequent them.  Well, duh!Towering over them all, of course, is Al Swearengen, the gloriously unscrupulous, profane, and hilarious Ian McShane, in the character and performance of a lifetime.  Swearengen's ruminations and outbursts remind me of Jean Shepard talking about his father's cursing ""my old man worked in profanity like other artists worked in clay or paint"" or ""he wove a tapestry of curses that is drifting somewhere over lake Erie to this day"".So, if you are offended by serious profanity interspersed with some of the best dialogue I've heard in ages, for crying out loud do not watch Deadwood or buy this DVD.That said, many other reviewers have outlined all the things to like about Deadwood.  Dense and complex characters, atmosphere and plots.  All true.  As mentioned above, I also find the show damn funny, and find the ironic twist and the acerbic aside delightful and hilarious.  It is an off-center look at the entrepenuerial spirit and the American Dream.  It's assorted losers trying one more time to hit it big before civilization, big business and the Politicos crush them. And it never failed to surprise me.The cast is superb.  I could single out individual performers, but the fact is all of them, from the ""Mayor"", to Doc, to the Widow, to the marvelous Calamity Jane, to the muleskinner, to Trixie and Bullock and his partner are all first rate. Not to overlook the brief appearance of Wild Bill nicely done by Keith Carradine.It is a terrific ensemble piece that is immeasurably enhanced by the towering performance of McShane's Al Swearengen.  What an inspiration of casting to find in this very competent, but rarely seen, British actor, someone who has somehow pulled out of himself this incredibly powerful, shameless, vile, conniving, ruthless, frightening and captivating rogue.  Swearengen is a total piece of work, a prism of differing colors from moment to moment, reflecting his mood and situation.  With his own weird charisma offset by so many different characters and sensibilites, Deadwood makes a constant claim on your attention and intelligence.Many of the episodes are written by women.  I ascribe no significance to this, other than an interesting detail, unless perhaps it partially explains why the women characters are as complex, tough, gritty and flawed as the male characters in Deadwood.First rate in all departments, this is work that challenges and delights if the profanity and earthiness of it's characters doesn't put you off.  Season Two really took flight, but anyone new to the series will need the first season to get their sea legs. McShane and all the others have their sea legs by the next season and Al Swearengen talking to the ""Chief"" is coming up and it is priceless."	5.0	Hilarious and Profane Eloquence!	2005-11-26	9	8	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2JGFN31Y2W3DH	ARHGRAD	Wow... I am not sure what people are expecting here. 1) This is HBO and not FX; 2) Remember that it's this role that propelled Timothy Olyphant to Justified... not vice versa; 3) And lastly, for those complaining about bad language, you do realize that someone gets shot and killed in nearly every episode of Justified (a show I also enjoy), right? Why is it that we as a society are so much more traumatized and offended by television cursing than television violence and murder? I guess I just don't get it...As for the show itself, the writing is masterful, and Ian McShane puts on an absolutely brilliant performance as antihero/villain Al Swearengen. I think he might be my favorite character in any HBO series (with all due respect to The Wire). Timothy Olyphant is excellent as always and the perpetually underrated John Hawkes and W. Earl Brown shine through in supporting roles. This was a series that was cancelled too early, but shows a dramatic and gritty vision of the Old American West. For those expecting the patriotic heroism of John Wayne and romantic, escapist westerns, you are bound to be disappointed. But for those who prefer the dirt, muck, and wildness of the historical west, this will be the series for you- don't let the language stop you.	5.0	Amazing series...	2014-05-24	1	1	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2R4E5M41LLLLP	Armchair Critic	Having just come from watching--and thoroughly enjoying--all four Amazon Prime seasons of Justified and hoping to enjoy Timothy Olyphant in the western role that launched his career, I decided to check out Deadwood, also on Amazon Prime.Oh what a disappointment, even moreso since I had read that Deadwood was supposed to be some kind of revolutionary mini series. Yes, Timothy Olyphant looks sharp and the role of Seth Bullock definitely solidified his western cred, but the show itself just struck me as tedious. I made it through the first season and into the second, but the last several episodes were a real chore to watch and I eventually had to accept that it just wasn't satisfying to watch.I don't even mind all the cussing, which seems to dominate the other 1-star reviews. (Although it does make one imagine the writers gleefully exclaiming, &#34;Hey this is HBO, let's put an F-bomb and C-sucker in every other sentence! It'll be totally cool and revolutionary!&#34; Haha) It's hard to say exactly why I lost interest, although things like the ominous music every time something bad was about to happen really annoyed me, along with the writers' seeming love of drunk tirades as a way to create tension and conflict, but in the end, if a show isn't satisfying, it just isn't satisfying.But I guess the real reason I'm writing this review is this: If you love Timothy Olyphant in a cowboy hat, stick with Justified. It is MUCH more entertaining than Deadwood!	1.0	I just don't get the hype	2014-06-24	3	2	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AEEV5UCSH2V6X	Art Stanton	Deadwood blends the old West with a different view of the intellect of the first pioneers. The normal view that western pioneers barely had a grasp on the English language is totally removed in the mastery of the language exhibited by the cast. In addition, the traditional view that the hero is the person with Elizabethan principles is no where to be found among the characters. I love the fact that each character is multifaceted, more of a realistic blend of behaviors, a little villain here, a bit of saint there, in the end a realistic and oh so believable character.The story lines capture the motivations of humans everywhere, greed, fear, love, hate, etc. the real deal. Yet they are blended in an intriguing fashion that keeps you watching; not only to see the outcome of the plot, but also to see the effects that one person produces on another. People do help to shape each others characters.Anyone who loves humanity would be enthralled with the realism of this show and it is unspeakably entertaining to be liberated from type cast characters.	4.0	Deadwood Season 1	2014-06-09	0	0	0

Not that I've seen many, mind you, and being from New England  I'm new to the whole midwest theme concept; but this show is brilliant. It's hysterically funny and touching and clever; and the writing is absolutely fantastic.There is however a side effect to watching this show: you will begin to notice a distinct smattering of pepper in your vocabulary. They use tremendous amounts of foul language in particularly creative ways; it's part of the charm but unfortunately rather infectious. I'd sword off swearing for several years now, not out of any great moral feeling but out of a general desire to improve my vocabulary and not be perceived as a foul-mouthed mental midget. Since beginning to watch the show I have regressed dramatically, catching slippage several times a day.Oh well. Hopefully it's a temporary aberration and will pass when we're done with season 3. And it's still one of the few perfect shows in the history of the TV.As a point of reference, the other shows I count as perfect include Dexter season 1, Dead Like Me, Wonderfalls, Firefly, and Journeyman.	5.0	Fantastic, with an unfortunate side effect	2008-06-03	3	2	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2POUR9NKIVS1V	aweewee	This is a great show!  I usually don't go for these western types of movies or shows, but this is really good.  Plus, I heard mention of it, especially talk about Ian McShane and this is one show that certainly lives up to the hype.  I recognized the actor Callie who also plays the retired, cancer-riddled cop on Sons of Anarchy and am happy to say that this man is just as great in this role.  I love Olyphant in this as well.  As a matter of fact, this is one of those moments where the cast just comes together perfectly and it shows in every performance!  A very well written and smart show.  Even the excessive bad language adds spice and flavor.  I've only just finished season one and cannot wait to see what else is in store!	5.0	Alive for Deadwood!	2014-06-06	0	0	0

What wonderful characters, and fascinating scripts. This series is many things--addictive and gripping historical fiction, a stew of emotionally stirring stories and relationships, occasionally hilarious comedy, and moments of truly touching poignancy.A lot has been said about the caliber of acting and writing; it's all true, this is good stuff. ""Deadwood"" is quality television that belongs among the ranks of M*A*S*H, Northern Exposure, All in the Family, The Sopranos, Downton Abbey, and Twin Peaks.But, take care. This is a place of corruption, greed, violence, profanity, booze, crude sexuality, filth and disease. As it should be.Yet more importantly ... it has within it copious amounts of hope and humanity.Do yourself a favor and visit Deadwood. It's a treat. Not for everyone, but so rewarding.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2HL7R8R23NERT	Bart King	We have a reputable Shakespeare company in Oregon, and my wife and I make annual pilgrimages to see their latest productions. I mention this autobiographical trivia because I couldn't put my finger on why DEADWOOD seemed so familiar to me. It was not because I've seen westerns before, because DEADWOOD is profoundly different from any western that's ever been made.And then I realized it: This is the equivalent of modern-day Shakespeare.Lest the good reader think I am overreaching, let's review DEADWOOD's merits: Layered storylines, exemplary casting and acting, pathos and comedy, gritty realism... but most importantly, the language, my God, the LANGUAGE!Much has been made of DEADWOOD's incredibly salty lingo, but I think discourses on the show's profanity unfairly overshadow the fact that the lines these characters deliver are pure gold. In Deadwood, conversations are masterful displays of timing and wit, and even lowly characters like Farnum get delicious speeches that plumb their souls, please our ears, and stir us if we are willing to listen. Just like the Bard wrote!In short, this is genuinely brilliant material. All praise to writer/creator David Milch (and be sure to watch the DVD extras where he is interviewed.)	5.0	Modern-day Shakespeare, with a lot of !@#$%$#@s thrown in!	2006-05-23	15	12	3
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A30JCT9JUKP5PT	baytor	"Firstly, to the reviewer who wrote ""I would not have bought it had I known how BAD the language was."", I have this to say: you dropped seventy bucks on a season of a show you knew nothing about?! I wish I was that rich (either that or I hope never to be that reckless).Seriously, this show has more swearing in it than anything I can think of at the moment. But then this is based on a real rough and tumble mining town. In a town built on vice and greed, where the brothel owners where the most respected and powerful members of the business community and murder was merely a casual occurance, you're kidding yourself if you think their historical counterparts were really throwing around alot of ""darn""s and ""goshdang""s. If you can't handle swearing, and lot's of it, then stay away from this!That said, this show is a dialogue afficianado's dream! It's got the color and energy of Tarantino's dialogue, David Mammet's fascination with different dialects, and the structure and style (up to and including soliloquy!) of Shakespeare's dialogue. The characters are fascinating and complex too. But what do you expect when all of them are forced to make deals with the devil on a daily basis just for mere survival? This is the old west as a filthy, brutal corrupting existance. That is to say, this is the real old west that hollywood has hidden from us for the past century.This show is a feast!"	5.0	As if Tarantino, Mammet, and Shakespeare had collaberated on the dialogue	2005-08-01	7	7	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1QY1LMG7IYZ1A	Bellamy	Being a western movies fan, this Deadwood series is captivating to watch.  The backdrop of Deadwood, its people and their period costumes, the store fronts, the tools, mud, hitch posts &#8211; all of it becomes a visual time machine and transport the viewer back to the mid 1870&#8217;s.  Gives one a little sense of what it must have been like to be living in a period like that.My only complaint (and reason for 4 stars for whole series) is the amount of foul language flowing ceaselessly from the many characters in the show.

"This DVD set has gorgeous, earthtone-saturated visuals, enough hardcore swearing to make even you turn down the volume so your neighbors don't think you're a sinner, and (the early few episodes especially) is so dense with period dialogue and political machinations that you'll probably have to go back and listen to conversations again to really understand who is playing who, and exactly what the game is. The characters...... oh my god, the characters. A few in particular are complex and genuinely delightful to watch, even the nasty businessman/saloon owner/ crime boss Swearengen. At the very least, try and track down the first few episodes as a rental, and see if it's your thing. This series, at least this first season, is quite different from The Sopranos and Queer As Folk and other ""mature"" series on expanded cable.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AABRQFSWDTQ1L	BILLB	Deadwood is a well done, period western which provides a more realistic, if gritty, depiction of one of the Wild West's most colorful spots. (or dark spots!)Tim Olyphant is typically strong and attractive but is someone overshadowed by the brilliant Ian Mc Shane as the malevolent Al Sweringen. These are both REAL characters of real people, and the show is somewhat historically based and correct. That makes it all the more interesting.  Seeing this period without the glitz normally painted on by Hollywood creates an interesting juxtaposition with all the westerns we watched as kids.  Very well written and acted and the production elements are just outstanding.	4.0	Great show	2014-06-13	0	0	0

She just loved the show and coud not stop talking about it. This is just another in a list of superb TV series put ou by HBO.This is a down to earth look at how things really were in the old west.  Compare the scenes to the pictures from history books and you see a striking similarity.  THIS IS NOT GUNSMOKE, BONANZA, OR THE BIG VALLEY with the pristine salloon and modern updated ranches.  This is dirty, gritty, vial and vulgar...just the way I invision the old west being.  Look at it like this.  It is the Sopranos of the old west.  This won'tt be seen in School history classes or on regular TV.  I don't recommend it for anyone's children and most adults will probably be offended by the lude vocabulary and actions of some of our historical heros like Wild Bill and Calamity jane.

This one got it right; almost perfect in fact. The characters are interesting, the acting and writing both terrific.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E	B. Martin	I have never been a big fan of westerns so I didn't really expect to find myself so drawn to Deadwood--but this is not your typical western.  Deadwood is the western reimagined with a myriad of complex characters, vulgar and grandiose (and I mean that as a compliment) dialogue, ambitious themes including greed, loyalty, morality, etc. and surprising dashes of dark humor that serve as a respite from the often intense proceedings.Set in a lawless town that sprouts up in the Dakotas during the late 1800's, Deadwood's first season follows a panoply of individuals who have flocked there for varying reasons including, most prominently, the allure of gold.  But not everyone is there to strike it rich.  The infamous Wild Bill Hickock has come there to live out his final days (at one point in the series he asks his friend, Charlie, to allow him to go to hell in his own way) while others are looking to get out from under the law.  Lawlessness seems to be the only constant in the morally bankrupt town of Deadwood, but what's fascinating is how a certain sense of order manages to emerge from the chaos.Deadwood doesn't rely on huge plot twists or melodrama to propel its story.  Everything that transpires is largely character driven as the citizens of the town act out of greed, jealousy, rage and a desire for power.  All of the performances are stellar, especially Ian McShane as Al Swearingen the owner of the town's local saloon.  Swearingen has a pitch black soul and an intensity in his eyes that could cut through even the bravest of souls.  Yet even he is not without complexity.  Swearingen is ruthelss and will do whatever is necessary to protect his own interests, but he still sees the need for order and fairness (however twisted that idea may be to him) and is even capable of compassion as evidenced in the season finale.Granted, the profanity comes fast and furious in this series which will understandibly turn many away.  But for me the profanity is as much a part of the characters as is their complex motives and moral ambiguities.  Deadwood just wouldn't feel right without either of them.	4.0	Not your traditional western	2011-04-05	2	2	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A59G0SO6XCRIN	Bob Charles	This story takes place in the &#34;Old West&#34; in a territory that does not even have statehood.  Thus, it was a fairly long time ago.  Most of the actors have pearly white teeth---really?  The language is extremely vulgar, or, quite sophisticated---but, from the same people??There is some good acting in this presentation, however, I would reserve that comment for Trixie and Doc. It just is not believable.	3.0	Quite confused	2014-06-11	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A4MQNH1UUV5FY	Bonnie M. Sharpless	"I can't help but notice that the only bad reviews of this incredible series have been based almost exclusively on the profanity, and that's a shame.  I admit that the very first time I watched Deadwood, I was a little turned off by the language.  But I didn't let it stop me, and boy am I glad I didn't!  (I read one reviewer who referred to it as ""aural wallpaper,"" and that's exactly how I find it - part of the backdrop, like the scenery.  After a while, you don't even notice it, but it's definitely part of the feel of the show.)If you're not watching because of the language, you're really missing out on something.  This is, without a doubt and hands-down, the greatest series ever to appear on television.  The characters are so interesting that you'll find yourself watching over and over and then thinking and discussing long after about exactly what they meant by this word or that gesture.Al Swearengen is probably the best character that I have ever seen portrayed in TV or the movies.  Ian McShane gives Swearengen a depth of character that you can't imagine when first you meet him in his Gem Saloon.  Upon watching the very first episode, I thought that it was going to be no more than another good guy (Seth Bullock) in white hat vs. bad guy (Swearengen) in black hat story.  One-dimensional characters.  But within a very few episodes, each of these characters had developed layers and sides that were amazing.I'm not sure if it's the directing or the acting or some combination of both, but the performances, for the most part, are flawless.  Often things are conveyed with a look or a gesture, no words needed.  Every character is given life by actors who all seem at the top of their game.The language, and I refer here not to the profanity but simply the dialogue, is one of the highlights of the show.  The characters speak in complicated sentence structures that lend so much interest to the story.Deciphering this language, as well as the complexity of the plot, makes every episode require intense concentration and repeated viewings.  This show is not for the casual viewer, which is why I think so many people don't ""get"" it.  They're turned off by the language, so they don't give it a chance to win them over with its dialogue, scenery, acting, character development, complexity, etc.  There's so much going on in every episode that it takes more than once to figure it all out and to put it in context.Please, if you value entertainment that requires you to think and doesn't talk down to you, give Deadwood a try.  I highly recommend catching it from the very beginning, so you'll know the characters inside and out, which is one of the show's greatest strengths.  Buy the DVD and then watch the second season when it's re-run or comes on DVD.  You won't be disappointed if you really give it a try.And (to quote a line from the second season) ""Welcome to fu&*ing Deadwood!"""	5.0	Get Past the Profanity and Enjoy!	2005-04-30	28	25	3
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	ANJFB4UTB3YDH	"Book Lover ""Peace Please"""	I live in the real world, so foul language doesn't bother me in the least and the fact that every other word is a swear word - is funny! I have to say the Calamity Jane character is my favorite. She's soooo darn good and FUNNY! Ian McShane is outstanding as Swearengen..  He makes a great villain. Timothy Olyphant is very, very good. It was nice to see Keith Carradine again! The stories are great. The characters are just wonderful and the acting is top-notch.Some of the things they did back then (IF they are, in fact, true), like....feed all the people they killed to the pigs!!! Ugh! - is really gross. They killed like it was nothing - just the way to settle things - let's slit a few throats today, women were treated like chattel and used strictly to pleasure men unless they were wealthy women and the way minorities were treated was just abhorrent. Thank the Goddesses we now have Civil Rights in this country!This is a GREAT series, but if foul language hurts your delicate senses, pass on this one because every other word is a swear word.	5.0	Excellent series and I find the foul language hilarious!	2014-05-26	0	0	0

I started out hating him (the character he plays) with a passion and by the end of season one I really enjoy watching him and seeing what he is going to do next . . . great mix of good and evil in one person.

I have been wanting to have those conversations about deadwood, but much to my dismay hardly anyone watches it regularly.Deadwood is the hidden gem of the HBO series, and personally, its the best TV I have ever watched.  Every charcter, every subplot means something.  The writing is top notch, the scenery is authentic, the adcting is strong, and the story keeps you on the edge of your sweat.Ian McShane as Al Swarangen gives an absolutely oustanding performance in the first season.  He plays a guy so mean and twisted that you can't help but love him.  I would watch the show for no other reason that for his character.I could go one for a long time about this show, but I won't.  I will just say watch it in time for the second season coming out, because you will be glad you did.

He walks around the time with his eyes bulging and moves like a zombie.Also, about half the cast of Sons of Anarchy are in this show, which is the only good thing. The part of Calamity Jane gets a little old also after awhile. The voice that the actor uses gets to be like finger nails on a blackboard. You just want to tell her to shut up.The show has too many slow parts and just doesn't go anywhere.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AMTPDYGEYYC0N	bud	Man! The characters on this show sure do swear a bunch! I never got to watch this show when it was first on the air, but since it has been added to Amazon's Prime selections, I've looked forward to seeing it. I became a fan of Tim Olyphant from his role as Raylen Givens on The FX network hit, Justified, and Ian McShane has long been an interesting actor, so I was doubly interested in this show . The supporting cast is top notch, full of recognizable faces you've seen in lots of other things over the years, so this is a great ensemble cast. The stories are okay, but nothing really to write home about. It's the dialogue that really gets your attention, and not just the near-constant cursing. There's a stilted formality to everyone's vocabulary that makes me wonder if this is just David Milch and Co. showing off or if people actually talked this way in those days. I mean, going back to Justified again, the writers on that show write some awesomely witty dialogue for their characters, but I've lived around enough Southern rednecks to know that very damned few of them have the linguistic chops portrayed by the make-believe residents of Harlan County, KY, and I'm pretty sure the gold-hungry residents of Deadwood, SD are no different. A minor quibble is Olyphant's portrayal of Seth Bullock. He seems nearly always on the verge of boiling over into violence. And it's tiring to watch. He spends nearly the entire season screwing his face into a barely masked rage at nearly everyone and everything. On the other hand, McShane's Al Swearingen and Powers Booth as his chief competitor for the horny gold miner market are both chewing enough scenery to put an entire herd of goats out of business and it's damned fun to watch; and anytime William Sanderson as E.B. Farnum or Brad Dourif as Doc Cochran are on screen, they are not to be missed. Others to watch are Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, John Hawkes as Bullock's mild-mannered business partner Sol Star, and Molly Parker as Alma Garrett. Parker's performance for most of the first season is rather inert, but at the end of the first season, you start to see a bit of fire as she and Bullock heat things up in the boudoir. Finally, if you're a fan of TV show drinking games, take any given episode and down a shot whenever Weigert's of McShane's characters utter a profane sexual reference...you'll be knee-walking drunk by the closing credits!	5.0	@%^$!!!!	2014-06-19	0	0	0

Why the producers and director would think that using the F-word, and other crude words, a million times in an episode is a good idea is beyond me.  I'm used to hearing profanity in movies but this series takes the cake!  I've never heard this much profanity spewed in my life and I used to work at a maximum security men's prison, so that's saying a lot.  It's like the main language of this show is profanity with a little bit of English thrown in now and then for variety.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A14PMCYYDIEQFJ	"Celtic Girl ""Celtic Girl"""	This is a raw, nitty-gritty look at the Old West, and it's not for the faint of heart or anyone who would be offended by language, violence, or sexual situations. Keep in mind that fact and fiction do a merry dance throughout the whole series, but if you're willing to go along for the ride, you'll enjoy both the repugnant and the endearing characters, who are displayed on the cusp of the establishment of law and order on the frontier. (And if you're wondering about where fact and fiction depart, a very good article by Anne Hyde, &#34;Deadwood as History,&#34; can be found online.) The series was nominated for many awards (and won some), and if you're a fan of Ian McShane and/or Timothy Oliphant (and other actors as well), this is definitely a must-see.	4.0	Highly entertaining mix of fact and pure fiction in the frontier West	2014-05-26	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3FX03KC9J5XZ1	Chris	Okay, I realize I don't watch all that much HBO programs but within the first couple minutes of pilot episode I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  The cursing is like nothing I've heard...ever.  There is so much that sometimes it becomes comical.  Usually, at least in my experience, a curse is used to emphasize something.  It seems there are three main curses used over and over again; sometimes every other word is a curse that is is how crazy it is.  But these three main curses are some of the harshest in the modern  English language.So if I get beyond the cursing and the gratuitous sex scenes I actually like the story.  I'm only through episode 6 but plan on finishing the season.  I hope the cursing slows down but if I know our culture, it's only going to get more intense.  Either that or I'm going to be desensitized to the cursing.-2 stars for all the intense amount of cursing and virtually meaningless nudity.	3.0	Why all the cussin'?	2014-06-27	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1CYOHNGQ1WED1	Christopher Hivner	Set in a burgeoning mining camp in 1876 in modern day South Dakota, Deadwood brings together honest businessmen, dreamers intent on striking it rich with a gold claim and crooks who go where the money is and the law isn't. The action boils around the Gem saloon owned and operated by Al Swearengen who knows everything that's going on in camp and how to profit from it. Seth Bullock and his friend Sol Starr are ex-lawmen from Montana who arrive to open a hardware store and immediately butt heads with Swearengen who they have to buy the plot from. Wild Bill Hickok rides into town burdened by demons and accompanied by ultra foul mouthed Calamity Jane. E.B. Farnum owns a hotel, sells information to Swearengen and talks in circles using big words and phrases in an attempt to elevate himself above his station. The only doctor in town has to deal with a plague, all the whores at two saloons and taking care of a Scandinavian child whose family has been killed.Deadwood is so well written and acted you almost forget how base it is. Until someone opens their mouth. This is probably the best depiction of a lawless old west town you'll ever see, but they do go overboard on the language. Sometimes the words are flying so frequently I start to laugh and that's not a good thing when you're presenting a drama. That being said, everything else about the show is wonderful. Ian McShane as Swearengen is unreal. Brad Dourif as the doctor gets better with each show, cresting with the episode when Rev. Smith dies. Dourif's scenes at the end are amazing. William Sanderson as E.B. Farnum continues to add to his resume of odd characters, both in comedies and dramas. It takes special talent to do both.I don't have HBO so I'm late getting on the Deadwood train, renting them from Blockbuster. Learning that there are only three seasons was a sad moment.

The ensemble of actors are unbelievably skilled and make each of their characters come alive. The dialogue, settings, photograghy and quality of writing is superb.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"It took me a while to get used to the mud, rhythms, challenged characters and odd syntax of this strange and often repellent Western series.  But, as with the best of HBO's hourlong dramas, patience pays off.It's as if David Milch, taking a cue from Tom Fontana, had wandered onto the set of ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" and plotted a series that describes the darker side of the west and of America's post-Civil War expansion.Although there are many characters, the central conflict is between saloon keep and crime boss Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) -- who wants to milk his town for everything he can -- and Bullock (Tim Olyphant), a chronically noble, hard-nosed sheriff-turned-hardware salesman who has a tendency to chafe the corrupt.  They're the axels of the wagon, surrounded by a host of colorful characters.Much has been made of the show's profantiy but not nearly enough has been said about the strange moments of friendship and sweetness that float through the darkness.  There's something strangely bittersweet about the shine the gruff Charlie Utter takes to Bullock; about Bullock's quiet bond with his partner Starr; Calamity Jane's devotion to Bill Hickok; and especially Brad Dourif's Doc, who treats everyone with tough-love compassion and a intense curiosity for the stranger side of medicine.  Even Swearengen has rare flashes of virtue and, in fact, in his dealing with Reverend Smith he performs the biggest act of kindness in the entire season.Unlike the four- and twelve-letter words (which are reportedly historically accurate to the time and place), the moments of mercy and humanity aren't as overt and have attracted less attention from critics.  They're subtle and require more attention and, in the end, elevate the series beyond its gritty surface."	5.0	"""Oz"" meets ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"""	2005-06-24	19	18	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AGHJ9BMVMGIOL	colinwoodward	"I just finished watching the first season. What a terrific show! However, it is excessively profane. First, let me address the profanity and then I'll get to the terrific aspects. David Milch, the show's creative talent, seems to forget that Deadwood is not Hell's Kitchen, NYC, in the 2000s. No doubt, towns like Deadwood were filled with profane people. Nevertheless, I have a PhD in early American history, and I can say with confidence that Westerners--even the worst killers such as those who populate this show--did not talk this way. There's a big difference between the profanity of the 1870s and today. ""MFer"" was simply not in common usage back then. The use of MFer and C-sucker is an affectation of the show's writers, nothing more. The show's intention regarding the language obviously is not historical accuracy, but to make these guys and gals seem tough. The show certainly makes its point. But as much could have been accomplished without using pervasive four and 12-letter words. After all, does anyone remember Eastwood swearing that much in his Westerns? Sure, it's HBO, and Deadwood should revel in its artistic freedom. But it gets carried away with its vulgarity. It was only until around WWII and after that such 12-letter words were used commonly. I mean, who even today uses C-sucker this much? The F-word certainly existed in the 1870s, but the more profane types were more prone to use G-damn and SOB. But rather than dispute the historical accuracy of the show's language, in using too much profanity, Milch makes a worse artistic mistake than a historical one. The swearing distracts us more than it underscores the drama and character development. Ian McShane's constant profanity is sometimes very funny and effective. At other times, it's unnecessary and distracting. I couldn't imagine anyone, no matter how tough or influential back then, telling an important politician to F-himself to his face. Even the most notorious criminals had more sense and diplomacy than that. And many of the characters talk the same way. Occasionally, we feel more like we're watching a David Mamet or Scorsese film than a Western--all the bad guys talk like a Bronx wiseguy. The show's excessive foul language aside, let me say that the merits far outwieght the in-your-face dialogue. For the most part, the historical details of the show are excellent. The sets, costumes, and props were carefully researched and are truly convincing. And many of the characters on Deadwood were real people, who really looked like they do on the show. It's nice to see people walking through muddy streets, just as they did in the 1800s. We see the West, warts and all. The show's greatest success, however, is in the energy, pacing, and performances. The ensemble cast is superb, made up of unknowns as well as familiar character actors. They all seem incapable of giving a bad performance. Much praise, and well deserved at that, has been given to the show's main characters of Al Swearingen, Seth Bullock, Cy Tolliver, and Wild Bill Hickock. However, my favorite character, and perhaps the most decent man to be found in Deadwood is the doctor, played by Brad Dourif (Exorcist III, Mississippi Burning). Also great is William Sanderson (""Larry"" from the Newhart show), who, as the hotel proprietor (and later, mayor) E. B. Farnum, is as slimy and calculating as they come. But he, as with McShane's Swearingen, gets laughs even when doing the most reprehensible things. But Farnum, not to mention Powers Boothe's Tolliver, seems more evil than Swearingen because his wickedness is behind-the-scenes. As amoral as Swearingen is, he doesn't hide much, and he is capable at times of compassion and understanding. Unlike so many previous Westerns, which focus on loners (the Eastwood and John Wayne pictures), gunslingers (The Magnificent Seven), outlaw bands (The Wild Bunch) or do-gooders (Bonanza), Deadwood involves a whole community in the action. Thus, we get the excitement of a Spaghetti Western as well as the complexity of a western show like Little House on the Prairie. Deadwood is not about gunfights or cowboys versus Indians, and those fights that are featured are free of cliches. Here, the struggle to survive often blurs lines of good versus evil. Deadwood is more about how people act in a society where rules and morality are fluid. Deadwood is a place populated by brutal, selfish, and cruel people. There are some good souls, but none are without their flaws or free of suffering. Deadwood is about the birthpangs of American society. Even more so, it is about human nature and the struggle for people to bring civility to a wilderness. But at a more basic level, it is simply great drama. Deadwood contains some of the most memorable and moving (not to mention violent) characters and scenes I have ever seen in a TV show. We get a much richer sense of humanity than on any other TV Western. Unlike Bonanza, good does not necessarily triumph. If the motion picture industry has stopped making good Westerns, then let HBO make them. The first season of Deadwood is the best 12 hours of Western ever put on film."	5.0	4.5 Stars	2006-05-14	11	9	2
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AQVBOVE8P7K3J	Condor Libros	In my opinion, this series represents one of the best takes on the Western in many a long year. The acting is first rate, even brilliant at times, and the gritty feel of the show (a grit that encompasses everything from the set design to the costumes to the language) strikes me as more inherently true to the show's time period than the squeaky clean sets and sanitized scripts of the old Fifties Western ever were.That said (and having read through a few of the negative comments and found what I think are common threads of complaint), I offer a fair warning to some who might be easily offended: this show is profane, in the strict sense that the scripts, while artfully constructed, are filled with every kind of bad word you can imagine, strung together in every kind of combination that you can imagine (and even, perhaps, some that you can't). There is violence and plenty of it, sometimes quite graphic. And there is a decent amount of nudity and sexual content. While I don't find (most) of it unnecessary - I think much of it serves the writers' goal of equating the corruption of the West with the corruption of the present - I would point this out to those who might be put off by such things. Sufficed to say, this ain't Bonanza.	5.0	A Brilliant, Profane Look at the Western	2011-07-09	3	3	0

If you are going to use bad language it should be authentic to the time period and serve a purpose to the plot line or character development. There was SO MUCH bad language that you lost what the conversation or plot was supposed to be about! It was actually DETRIMENTAL to following the storyline. Maybe they tamed it down after the first episode, but I am not even sure I will watch any more to even find out - as it was that bad.	1.0	EXTENSIVE, SENSELESS USE OF HORRIBLE LANGUAGE!!!!	2014-06-14	5	2	3

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3PFKE8EFXAXQE	"cornbreadthedog ""larue"""	"DEADWOOD ROCKS!A very dark and a very jarringly gritty western that's written in such a way as to bring the old west to life as it really was: every man's and every dreamer's out for himself, trying to stake a claim on the ever changing and ever shifting world around him, far from home and not a nickel to loan. Here, in this version of DEADWOOD, constant heartbreak and bitter betrayal seems just as natural as muddy streets and horse waste knowing each other on a first name basis!..LOL..LOL...My two favorite characters,so far, are E.B. FARNUM, the hotel owner and the ""mayor"" of DEADWOOD and,of course,  AL SWEARENGEN, the money hungrily complex and morally twisted proprietor of the brothel/saloon called THE GEM!The actor that plays E.B. FARNUM is a funny little scene stealer! He plays a scummy, shady, spineless but a somewhat unlikeable little weasel extremely well!Then, there's IAN MCSHANE who plays AL SWEARENGEN to sheer perfection! It might be just me, but at certain angles and because of the way that he carries on and intimidates people with his brooding insanity and spiteful ruthlessness, MCSHANE channels a little bit of an old west version of AL PACCINO into the villain that he's portraying. And that's a good thing.Man, I could go on and on about DEADWOOD and how there's so many cold and memorable lines in just this box set alone and how there's some very sweet and tender moments, like when the Reverend is comforting people with such joy when his own illness has overtaken him and has him bent over in the coffee brown mud. There's also some great laugh out loud and awkwardly humorous moments that light up my DVD player as well.I only have just one gripe about DEADWOOD. SOMETIMES I WISHED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TONED DOWN SOME OF THE FOUL LANGUAGE AND TONED DOWN SOME OF THE NUDITY A BIT. But, hey, I get it. They're prostitutes here and there's some serious fornication going on in an old western town. People cussed up a storm then and they still cuss like sailors nowadays anyways. Still, this is an HBO show and HBO has always pushed the envelope in creativity and has always embraced artistic expressions, however they may be showcased about.Yet,I still wished that there was a little less skin and more shoot outs in the streets of DEADWOOD.I'm over onto SEASON TWO of DEADWOOD right now. I'm busting my gut laughing and then turning right around and feeling some real empathy for the townsfolk of this makeshift western community. Who knows? Maybe that's the real appeal and the real inquisitive fascination of the old west for us here in America. Or it just might be the draw of a really good show?In any case...DEADWOOD'S got a new tenderfoot in town, mister.So's I'm a need some sausages, a frying skillet, a sleeping blanket, some beans, and a pick axe.What? 12 dollars?....(Drawing gun on  DEADWOOD merchant)"	4.0	THIS'UN HERE'S NOT YA' PAPPY'S KINDA' WESTERN, YOUNG-UN'!	2012-10-06	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3E8WELXHDOODQ	Craig Burgess	"I watched the first season, thoroughly engaged, and survived it, and I'm now entering the second season every bit as enthralled as I was with the first. I mention this because I think that a little bit of perspective is necessary to add to the ongoing discussion of the show's profanity. I tend to side with the earlier reviewer who believes that while the degree of profanity can be shocking to the uninitiated, perhaps we should all be a little more concerned about the shifting moral landscape of a camp like Deadwood, that results in everyday larceny and murder. And whether the profanity is historically accurate or not (I have heard arguments for both sides), there seems to be little doubt that the real dangers of life in Deadwood are probably pretty accurately portrayed.Viewed with some perspective, though, the profanity issue becomes a little clearer. Yes, there's no question that when first exposed to the series' dialogue one is taken aback and perhaps offended, or at best uncomfortable. But continued exposure tends to blunt that sword, every bit as much for us as it no doubt did for these characters until it becomes nothing more than an everyday manner of speech. The viewer does tend to stop wincing or giggling at the use of the words as they're uttered. Ultimately, I think the only lingering effect for most people is to have to remember to remain vigilant to keep the show out of the view of children.Lots of reviewers have talked about the richly drawn characters, and they are definitely that, in spades, and all the actors are uniformly superb. Others have written about the extent of period detail, though no one I've read has yet mentioned the fascinating process of the growth of the community and its evolution from a ""camp"" into what will eventually become a municipality. I've never seen another television series where you witness this kind of change. City planners should be fascinated by this show. Early on, the only built structures seem to be the hotel (with restaurant, both of dubious quality), a newspaper office, a shack for the doctor's practice, and a saloon/brothel (soon joined by a second such establishment). Even the hardware business co-owned by central character Seth Bullock begins in a tent. There is no civic government until it becomes clear one is necessary if the camp is to be viewed as a viable economic entity by the territory government, resulting in a hastily formed bureaucracy with largely titular heads. Even then, however, the future of the camp is far from certain, as characters as diverse as formal territory officials and slickly dangerous errand boys of moneyed interests arrive in town and compete for obvious or not-so-obvious control of the area's economic resources (read: gold, and all the transactions that result from its prospecting and mining). All of these circumstances force the camp's primary residents to forge uneasy alliances with one another in order to protect their interests, wisely or not. It's like a large-as-life chess game with multiple players. If any of them are to survive, they must be thinking many moves ahead.This chess-like quality to the story lines causes, I believe, a number of reviewers to claim that the plot unfolds too slowly. I prefer to think of it as occurring on a pace that allows us to savor it. In many ways, it's very much like Shakespeare. It has language that at first hearing is sometimes dense and off-putting, but which you eventually come to hear and understand as almost poetic. The richly human characters all wrestle with forces larger than themselves and are bound inextricably toward their common destiny, their acts frequently having unintended consequences. They even sometimes lapse into soliloquy. One of the very best occurs in the first season as the superb William Sanderson's (yes, of Larry, Daryl and Daryl fame) wonderfully unctuous and sycophantic hotelier EB Farnum laments his place at the bottom of the local socio-economic food chain, while trying, mostly in vain, to scrub an inevitable blood stain from the floorboards of one of his hotel rooms. Another in the second season has Ian McShane's larcenous Al Swerengen talking to a mysterious head-sized bound parcel he refers to as ""Chief,"" explaining how he will take it (him?) with him to the local post office as part of a ruse to draw out some information from postmaster Charlie Utter, the erstwhile friend of the late Bill Hickok, and self-appointed avenger of one of the camp's Madames.You can't help but watch this show and wonder what you would do if you were in any number of the characters' shoes. And that quality makes for some pretty compelling viewing. As greatly entertaining as many of HBO's original series have been, I believe this one is the most engrossing and thought-provoking since The Sopranos."	5.0	Like Shakespeare, but with a higher body count	2005-04-18	19	16	3

However, after an episode or two, I learned to ignore that, and just enjoy the plot, and I must say I did! One thing that I think this show does very well is having ""those guys"" in the show. For almost every character in the show, I can think of a person that sort of fits that role. It makes the show much more relatable. They also have complex characters. Al Swearengen is a perfect example. At times, he can seem like a funny, hard, but nice character, and others, you'll be glad you live nowhere and nowhen near him.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1UL0FO9AGP4LS	"Daniel Putkowski ""novelist, pilot, world trav..."	Deadwood takes you to a gold mining town of the 1870's, complete with a full cast of misfits, malcontents, morons, and myopic mongers. This show is not for the timid. The drama is complex, well woven, and worth every penny. However, the language is boldly profane, almost to the point of distraction. What keeps you mesmerized is the excellent writing and acting, both of which captivate and cajole you into wanting more at the end of every episode. Despite the profanity and violence, there is a stunningly good plot in this show. A widow with a valuable gold claim, a pair of merchants with law-man tendencies, a saloon owner of royal ambition, and a host of other characters trying to eek out an existence in a place where nothing's easy. What I enjoy most about this show is that it is not Bonanza or a lame western melodrama. Rather, it is a fully developed world populated by characters willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their ambitions within the context of boom town. It's not as simple as good guys versus bad guys. There are shades of evil and spots of serenity everywhere. How they splice together is where the action is and you won't be disappointed. I watched this show when it was on HBO and am glad to have it now to watch several more times. I only wish it would have remained a series. There's a lot more distance these characters can go.

Writers should realize that there's just so many times you can use 4 letter words.  If they run out of good dialogue, use bad.  THAT is not writing to me.  Should be rated triple X.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1CVN9371J9JL1	Dave R	Amazing acting all around,  deep characterizations, compelling storylines, and plenty of action. This and Carnival are the 2 best television series I've ever seen. I'm not generally a fan of western themed shows or movies, but this blew me away. Beware the non-stop profanity, though. Don't plan on watching any of these episodes with little ones within earshot. And when you're done watching the series, checkout the Wikipedia entry for Deadwood - gives a good overview of the historical accuracy of the characters, locations and events.	5.0	wonderful if you can tolerate the profanity	2012-10-06	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2ZDNY370ZIHR7	"Dave Sanasac ""MaceQuantex"""	"I'm not going to sit and rave about how wonderful this show is.  There's about a hundred or so comments already covering that.  I gave it five stars, so you know how I feel about it.I wanted to comment on the language in the show, more specifically the use of profanity and vulgarity.  It appears that there is something of a misunderstanding in some of these comments, and I just wanted to clear things up.In the late 1800's, Deadwood was not a part of the United States.  It was on land that had been promised to the Indians, meaning that every person living in the town was there illegally.  Because the town was not officially recognized by the US or the Indians, there was no governing body, no laws, no official organization.  This, combined with the gold that was found in the Black Hills, made it a perfect place for any outlaw looking to escape a warrant.But the fact that there were no laws in the town is important to remember if you're going to understand why such language was used.  If someone had just hit it big while looking for gold in the stream; there's no laws and no sheriff to prevent the previously mentioned outlaws from knocking the lucky miner out of his chair and stealing his gold.  The only incentive they have for not taking such actions is that the miner could just as easily drag them out of the saloon, shoot them, and take the gold back.Who do you think was a more likely target to have his gold stolen, the miner sitting around using words like ""Aww shucks"" and ""Golly gee"", or the one saying things like ""Go to h*ll, motherf****r""?  The use of the language was, basically, a way of protecting themselves.  They put on a show, acting tough (by talking tough - profanity and vulgarity), as a way of making themselves appear less vulnerable than they may really have been.And for those questioning the specific words they used, wondering about the historical accuracy of them - I can't claim to know that they used those words back then, I wasn't born in the 1800's.  But I do know that the f-word dates back as late as the 1500's.  The act of oral sex dates back even further, and there had to be a way of describing it.  The truth is that, other than the words that came about via technology (automobile, computer, internet, stockmarket, hertz, volts, etc) we really haven't invented any new words in a very long time.As for how the women in the town were treated, it's been estimated that in 1876 roughly 90% of the women in Deadwood were prostitutes.  Prostitutes aren't respected or treated very well now, so why would it have been any different then?Is the show 100% historically accurate?  No, of course not.  Hollywood has never produced anything that is 100% historically accurate, and they're never going to.  Is it more believable (and a more likely depiction of the point in time being shown) than most of the, so-called, period pieces that have been made in the last 30-40 years?  I would say so."	5.0	Just a few clarifications about the show	2005-12-17	13	11	2
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A22VR3OIN0NA51	David A. Harris	Unlike most of the westerns I grew up watching where nobody cussed or looked like they hadn't bathed in a month, Deadwood shows the muck and mud and blood of a hard, gritty life in a gold rush camp struggling to become a town. Not for the feint of heart or one who blushes at the sound of the worst curse words. But the atmosphere feels very real and authentic and the characters are three dimensional and believable, unlike the cardboard good guys and bad guys of early tv westerns.	5.0	Not Your Grandpa's 'Bonanza'.	2014-06-11	0	0	0

My favorite outlaw from these times was Wild Bill Hickok. He appeared in the first episode, so I knew I was going to watch it. I was a bit disappointed when he was killed off so early. But again keeping it real. Wild Bill was shot not long after he moved to Deadwood.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AJU1HJ99BL593	David Whitman	I overheard someone at work mention 'Deadwood' being a true portrayal of what the Old West was really like.  I thought to myself, 'cool!  something down and dirty with lots of gratuitous blood letting and gunplay'After watching 5 minutes of it, I had to change channels.  I love profanity in movies as much as the next crass American guy but when it's used in such a retarded context, it just ruins the whole thing.  And by the way, this is supposed to be in the 1800s!!  It's not realistic at all to have our ancestors of old sound like they were on an N.W.A. album.  I like N.W.A. but Cowboys who belt out 'F$@#' words in an Old west series is just as bad as Ned Flanders trying to act like Ice Cube.And as some other reviewer noticed, all of the characters looked like they just walked out of a beauty spa; moussed up hair, Aquafresh perfect teeth, and spotless clothing.  Hair products, frequent bathing, and a good dental plan were rare commodoties in the Old West folks!Sorry, this was not realistic at all for me.  I could care less how good the story was going to get.You want realistic swearing in the old West, then check out Tuco from the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1UKW34190DP5S	"dealsearcher1108 ""straightup"""	I love Westerns and this is a very good one in many ways.  The acting is top notch as is set design, photography and production values.  All the main characters are complex and multifaceted.  Characters range from the brooding, moody leading men to the sycophantic and tricky hotel owner to the leading ladies that include a newly rich widow, a tough talking prostitute and Calamity Jane who can be surprisingly eloquent even when falling down drunk.  In fact, several characters both major and minor wax philosophical, using insightful and articulate dialogue with aplomb.That brings me to the foul language.  It too abounds.  The F word is used to excess, in my humble opinion.  Yes, we know this story takes place in a rough and tumble mining camp in a lawless territory in the late 19th century.  We know that this camp is far from the culture and sophistication of New York and Boston.  WE GET IT!  Still, I doubt the F word was used with such mind numbing frequency, in front of anyone, man, woman or child, to the extent done here.  I'm no historian but this show often sounds more like &#34;Animal House&#34; on steroids than a honest depiction of the old West.I don't object to the use of foul language in the proper context for the purposes of realistic story telling but I do object to overkill.  If I had to hear  the same word repeated a thousand times over the course of a season I would find it boring, no matter if that word was as innocuous as the word &#34;blue&#34;.That being said, I loved season 1 of this series.	4.0	Fine Acting and Foul Language	2014-06-19	0	0	0

But as I watched the show I realized that was probably an accurate portrayal of life in Deadwood at the time.

The writing, filming and acting is just top niche from start to finish.  In a day in time when Westerns have basically bit the dust, it's good someone can reinvent it and give the genre such life, such depth.  It's emotionally draining and requires complete attention.  From start to finish McShane is sheer brilliance, but there is not one cast member that doesn't match his level.  It's strong, violent, profane, likely closer to the real old West than we have even seen before.It has moments to make you cry, laugh, and touch your heart with the gentle spirit of Jewel and her boot.Beautifully packaged, with over 90 minutes of bonus features.Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant!	5.0	McShane's Golden Globe is well deserved!	2005-02-10	12	11	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1OP60BY07E94U	D. Lea	I am not really sure what to make of Deadwood.  While it is an interesting portrayal of life in the Dakotas in 1876 just before joining the US and afterwards, it is, to say the least, disconcerting.  The degree of lawlessness is frightening but what is more shocking than even that is the language the characters constantly use.  Because it is an HBO production, I get that the swearing is &#34;allowed&#34;, but still, it is at first shocking to hear then becomes very tiresome and annoying.  I wonder how accurate that part of the series is.  It is a lot like being hit over the head with a 2x4 for the entire 56 minutes or so of each episode.  However, I AM watching it, so guess the story line is good enough to keep me interested.  Although it is sometimes difficult to follow who is who and what they are doing!D.

I'll admit it started out a little slowly for me, and I could even say boring.  I had just came off watching Spartacus season 1 and the prequel, and this was a completely different pace.  It became progressively more interesting as the season went on.  I was drawn in more and more, and by the end, I can say I'm pretty much addicted to it.  I cant wait to begin season 2.There are some really good characters here.  I read some people complain about the vulgar content.  Its true, if you are offended by foul language, violence or sex for sale, you may not be interested in Deadwood.  But I feel its probably pretty accurate as to how the wild west days were in the US.  If you think no one cussed, drank, or paid for sex back then, then you are pretty naive.  This is not a cookie cutter western.  I love the realness of it, and it brings a lot of comic relief as well!

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2XS9L9PMMYMLI	Doc	The language was worse than awful.  It was not truly representative of reality of that time.  If one does a little research, one would know that an errant foul word could be worth one's life.  There were actually few gunfights with pistols, but a lot of bad guys, with poorly controlled foul mouths, were laid low from down the street with a Sharps or a loose old shotgun loaded with ball ammo.  There was little tolerance, even in mining camps, for insulting behavior.  And the reason for that was that there was instant retribution close at hand.	3.0	Bad scripting	2014-06-13	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3HD7SVBY4JZOW	Donegal Dan	This series is, as many previous reviewers have said, positively addictive.  Yes, you have to get past the language, which I agree is probably easily done by the second or third episode.  Yes, it is violent, but the community depicted is so loaded with riveting characters and plotlines that the violence seems  secondary and, actually, appropriate for the time.  And the character played by Ian McShane has got to be an all-time great--he's violent and corrupt but if you listen to him talk you will be entranced and astounded by the almost poetic way  he expresses himself and the sardonic humor he displays.  I absolutely love this character.  And playing opposite him are a group of characters no less riveting--his rival saloon keeper; the newly arrived, honorable and seething ex-lawman Bullock; the local doctor; the mysterious, aloof and passionate new widow; the prostitutes who deal with the two saloonkeepers; the sleazy hangers-on who eddy around the central figures; and on and on.  If you can watch two episodes of this series and not be glued to it thereafter, I will be very, very surprised.  This is every bit as good as The Sopranos and maybe better, and the writing is superb.	5.0	A Western Like You've Never Seen Before	2005-03-08	7	6	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3LZJZ6T59QKJ2	Don Kushman	"I had not seen any of the Deadwood shows before during the regular TV season as I do not subscribe to HBO.  But I heard and read some of the raves so I decided to get a DVD package of the first season.I have been to the Black Hills and Deadwood several times so I was concerned about how the exteriors would look.  They are very authentic, even though I understand they are filmed on the Melody Ranch location in California (I wonder, is that Gene Autry's old ranch when he was a famous cowboy?)  The set for the town of Deadwood was built from scratch and the topography and setting look very much like the present-day Deadwood, allowing for modern development, of course.The actors are top notch, a real ensemble cast that blend well together and look like they are having a good time.  Not a ""star"" in the bunch (with the possible exception of Ian McShane), but I am sure they will become household names.  The writing is terrific.  I was initially put off by the excessive use of the ""F"" word in all its derivatives until it was explained by David Milch (the creator-writer) that this was common to rough mining camps of those times.  Robin Wiegert's portrayal of Calamity Jane is particularly delicious and at times hilarious.I have just ordered the second season of Deadwood on DVD and am looking forward to another 12 hours of top-notch entertainment."	5.0	Authenticity And Great Acting Prevail	2006-08-23	6	5	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A37GRFP6VMUXKT	"Douglas S. Wood ""Vicarious Life"""	"Deadwood is a hugely entertaining HBO series that smartly mixes fact and fiction to recreate a mythic period of American history - an illegal goldrush in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The major characters, saloon owner Al Swearengen, Seth Bullock, EB Farnum, Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickok, his killer Jack McCall, and newspaperman Albert Merrick and many other really did live in Deadwood in this period. Many of the fictional characters are representative of certain archtypes.The show gives a good feel for the rapid growth of Deadwood, the temporary feel to almost everything, the lawlessness, and the wild gambits to make a buck. An excellent web site called ""Legends of America"" has a phenomonenal section on Deadwood, the reall city as well as Deadwood the HBO series. They will sort out the fact from the fiction for you.Ian McShane as Swearengen and Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane stand out among a strong cast.Highly recommended especially for fans of the Old West.

Brilliant acting,  directing and dialogue make this without a doubt one of my favorite shows of all-time.Ian McShane deserves an Oscar for his performance and it was a shame that he wasn't nominated for an Emmy.(Talk about highway robbery) but the international media made up for it recognizing his epic performance with a Golden Globe.I love the cast and I enjoy the simmering Timothy Olyphant as the soon to be sheriff of Deadwood. His under-the-top, silent stong type, is the perfect compainion for the sometimes over the top Powers Boothe and McShane battling for control of the town.I just love this show and I believe if you are able to become more acquainted with the characters you will love it as much as I do.	5.0	Possibly The Best Show Ever	2005-02-08	18	16	2

It is very gritty and I'm sure the language and subject matter would be morally offensive to some people  However I really enjoyed watching it and suspect it is a fairly accurate depiction of a pre-statehood gold camp where anything goes.  Story lines and character development make you want to keep watching.  It is interesting to see Timothy Olyphant 10 years ago.  The reason I ordered the series is because I had just finished watching the Justified series and like Timothy Olyphant's work.  All the actors do a good job (love Jane and Doc) and the production values and scripts are well done.

There was hardly a sentence spoken without 1-3 unprintable words, and not just the usual stuff one might expect to hear in movies today.  We just could not take the crude language.  I was in the army for 3 years and didn't hear anyone that talked as crude as this, even drill sergeants.  I would expect some foul language from most anything that Hollywood does today, but this is beyond any normal persons sensability.  I don't know anything about the plot or acting and don't care. We never got that far.  If the bad language stops you every few seconds, nothing else matters anyway.  Do not buy this product!!!  Do not waste your time to see it, even for free!! Do not let your friends see it!!!  I have never done this before, but I'm going to send it back and see if they will give me my money back.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2ZT3DIS3GGE25	Duncan C. White	The cinematography, the scenery are all first rate, you feel that you have a window into this 19th century encampment. Theres characters of many shades in the camp and its anything but your usual television pablum. I thought the show was well paced early in the season with many character introductions and interesting plot twists. However later in the season the plot moved along at a glacial pace. This is probably the biggest knock on the show, it really does move at a slow pace.Thankfully the characters are interesting enough despite the slow pace. Though unfortunately probably the most interesting character of all dies halfway through the first season. I'm not sure the producers of the show once they saw the powerful performance of that actor may not have wanted that character to stay on the show for another season or so before his inevitable demise. No one steps in to fill his shoes, so despite rationalizing the loss as 'historically accurate' you cant help but feel a bit cheated at the loss.Still we're left with Swearengen who is obviously the star of the show now, and he's suitably interesting to keep things rolling along. Occassionally another character like Bullock or someone else has a good scene in the show and breaks out of their mold. I'm not sure if the scriptwriters are simply better at writing for compromised and conflicted characters like Swearengen and Hickcock or if they're just more interesting to watch, but they totally outshine the other characters on the show who sometimes seem a bit wooden.A very watchable show that is faithful to its period and has production values equal to that of any Hollywood movie let alone any television show. Despite being better than whats on television there are problems with the show which i've pointed out, on balance though I enjoy watching each show even if occassionally theres a stretch of a particular show here or there that gets a bit bogged down and is a bit of a chore to watch.	3.0	Not without flaws, but a program that elevates the medium	2005-02-19	28	10	18

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2G39KAEO73GVC	echoes999	HBO is known for it's great TV shows, I should know, since I've already payed a fortune getting them all on DVD. Whether it's The Sopranos, Oz, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Six Feet Under or Carnivale, they're all incredible shows. But with Deadwood they've truly out done themselves. This has got to be one of the best shows ever created, and yes, it even squeaks by Sopranos as my favorite show.David Milch, the creator has crafted a pure work of art and managed to reinvigorate the genre Western. The show has everything you could possibly want. It follows several main characters as well as quite a few secondary characters. There's Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) the Gem Saloon owner who basically runs Deadwood from behind the scenes. He is one of the most incredible villians I've ever seen on screen, and it's not because he's so evil. It's because he's so multi-diminsional. Yes he's evil and mean, the killer, the brothel owner, drug dealing snake. And yes he strikes fear in almost everyone he meets, but at moments you see he has another side to him. In a roundabout way he does care about his underlings and the prostitutes that work for him, and occasionally you see moments of compassion and good come out of Swearengen. He's a rather complicated villian that McShane plays with pitch-perfectness. How he didn't get nominated for an emmy I'll never know. Just one look from him and you can see why people are so afraid of him.Another main character is Seth Bullock,(Timothy Olyphant)who used to be a sherrif and has come to start a hardware buisness with his partner Sol Star(John Hawkes). The only problem is, Seth has a quick temper and comes to blows with Swearengen quite easily as he quickly falls in love with a newly made Widow Garret(Molly Parker)There's also Wild Bill Hickok(Keth Carradine) the famous killer and gambler along with his friend Calamity Jane(Robin Weigert) who is almost comedy relief in such a gritty show, but never so much you feel like she's just a mockery. There's the Doc(Brad Dourif) who looks after the camp and Swearengens girls. Dourif does an incredible job make Doc credibly and vulnerble, since he was involved with the Civil War and still suffers bad memories of what happened there.There's another not so nice Saloon owner Cy Tolliver(Powers Boothe) who has more of a quite rage compared to Searengen's gusto, but he's still someone not to be messed with.The show centers on Deadwood, a real place in South Dakota in 1876. The Gold rush is on and there's plenty of it up in the hills around town, and not only that, but Deadwood is lawless because it's on Indian territory. This show is a gritty look into America's past, touching on plagues and diseases, the advancement of civilization, one mans dream of controlling the city and other mans reluctance to keep things morally right with the law behind him. This is one of the smartest shows I've ever watched, with great, beautifully written dialogue. A lot has been said about the use of those four letter words all throughout the show, but it fits in with everything else the West was and you hardly notice it. One of the great things about this show is that it builds and builds in momentum through talking and action, and then suddenly there's a moment of quick viciousness you didn't quite know was coming, and it just hits you. Plus the show is so down in the mud gritty, with violence and evil people all around, that when the moments of peace and uplifting come, they're just that much more poignant. This show is incredible and I can't wait for season two, especially with Soprano's ending soon, I now have something even better to watch. Go out and buy this great DVD right away.	5.0	HBO's best show yet.	2005-02-26	13	11	2
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1HXKZYZEJ10GP	eco-liberal	By the end of the first episode I was completely hooked. HBO has a magical way of collecting the best directors, writers, and actors to produce series that knock your metaphysical socks off. The dialogue in Deadwood is priceless - forget the hopelessly inane carping about profanity. Every character's line reveals something of his or her fiber, authentically projected forward from a milieu that disappeared over a century ago. The most interesting stories take place in stressful, extreme environments, and the unannexed, lawless town of Deadwood is all of that. You'll find yourself fascinated by Al Swearengen, played by Ian McShane, wondering whether there's any light in the dark chasm of his soul (I think there is).	5.0	Better then the Sopranos	2005-05-03	15	13	2

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1PXJ2LZNQBMDK	E. Rodriguez	"Deadwood is a cold eyed accurate portrayal of life in the ""West"", specifically South Dakota and its territories prior to official statehood. It is raw, crude, and messy much like life itself at that time. The brilliance comes from the writing and the acting. All of the characters are multidimensional which makes them believable. The actors are clearly loving the roles and doing an excellent job of bringing these people to life. Many have criticized the language as overly crude. According to historians, the language used is accurate which negates the idea that it is used for shock affect. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who has an interest in U.S. History, Westerns, and good  story telling."	5.0	The Real West	2007-01-03	3	2	1

Many valuable insights to this great series.I don't subscribe to HBO, and as with the Sopranos, my introduction to the series came with the DVD. I can't watch it one episode at a time; must have two or three at least. It is worth every penny, and more so.This is for everyone who loves good drama.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A23H8NTLI7UJSL	"Eugene Kasper ""Gene"""	Deadwood is almost too realistic.  This is about a time in our recent past where. in some areas of the West, we had no law enforced by the police.  The limits put on individuals in a society without the formal rule of law is well presented and shows although no police or government enforcement of laws against violence, how a society still functioned with constraints and some unstated practices.  There is an underlying &#34;fairness&#34; or give and take which developed.It is also a great story based on characters that are human meaning not perfect or all bad.  It could be offensive to some as the language, violence and sex is raw, like it most likely was.Loved it.	5.0	Great video	2014-06-15	0	0	0

I bought the set when it came out mainly because I miss westerns of any kind these days.  Also, due to some controversal reviews being out in TV Guide and Entertainment magazines.On watching the very first episode, I became mesmerized...somewhat shocked, but mesmerized all the same.  My husband loved it as well and we watched the whole series over one weekend.  After watching it, I loaned it to my SIL, who did the very same thing.  In March, my eldest son came for a visit and he did the same thing.  In April, I loaned the set to my youngest son's family,Jim did the same as the rest of us.  Jim loaned it to his best friend before returning the set to me.I can only say this.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A19OQ7LWE2YJL3	"F.Faulkner ""F.F."""	Love it! What do I love? The multi-dimensional characters. There is a little good or a little evil in everyone, let's see it on TV. I love HBO series Sopranos, Carnivale & Six Feet Under. I loved Carnivale best, then Deadwood, then Sopranos, then Six Feet Under.For Ian McShane this is the portrayal of a so-far lifetime. You don't see better acting. He's amazing and deserves an Emmy. And I hated him as Lovejoy (sorry Ian). Brad Dourif again deserves an Emmy. He's superb, and I do not overstate. Ray McKinnon's exquisite portrayal of the Reverend brought tears to my eyes, repeatedly. He definitely deserved an Emmy.  The ladies' parts are excellent, but I think a little overmuch is made of Calamity Jane because she is so, ahem, different. But the actress portraying her is perfection. Trixie is my favorite, played by Paula Malcolmsen. What I absolutely love most about the women's parts is that they are real women with real faces. No botox - they are beautiful with expressions, an occasional little wrinkle and imperfect eyebrows. :-)What a sad state of the world that HBO would cancel Carnivale AND Deadwood!! There really is no justice in television. Deadwood was in the Top Ten of best TV shows!

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A126PX54V9JW0B	franburst	I gave this show four episodes and then quit.  I was trying to get past the vulgar cussing that goes far beyond the F word and get into the character development and story line but it just didn't happen.  The story as I saw it was this-A former sheriff and his partner (seems to be a good guy) arrive in Deadwood,  a wild and wooly lawless &#34;encampment&#34; during a gold rush to start a hardware store. This encampment is a very crude main street with a saloon and brothel being owned by the villain in the story who extracts his price from all those who cross his path.  There are no laws or property rights in Deadwood.  As with most gangsters he's protecting his growing encampment by killing without giving it a second thought.  Nothing surprising in this character.  He's your typical psychopath gangster in a very wild west setting and after four episodes is a despicable character with no redeeming qualities.  In contrast to the highly rated Sopranos, which I liked very much and where foul language, violence and explicit sexual content is plentiful, this show just isn't good.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the setting, scenery  and and appearance of the characters really displayed the crude and basic existence available in Deadwood to the point where I could almost smell the body odor on the people who clearly didn't bathe.	2.0	Not My Idea of Entertainment	2014-06-04	1	0	1

I don't know enough about history to know if there is any historical truth to the story or if it is all fiction.  But I kept my interest, until it dropped off the air.I am not sure if it failed because people are less interested in westerns or because some people would be upset by the chevanistic way of life.

Personally I was one of the people that watched The Wire first, and the tales of McNulty, Bunk, Kima and Omar were way more interesting to me than anything that was in the first season of Deadwood.Now don't get me wrong, there are some really great characters in this show, and there is obviously some fantastic writing going on, but over all when put up against my favorite HBO show this one just didn't cut the mustard.  I'm not saying you should skip this at all though.

Miners, and others of that age were probably even more filthy, and evil smelling than portrayed.  I would doubt that so many folks used such overwhelming profanity, all the time, particularly the ""horrible"" ""f---"" word.  No doubt they swore, and probably quite a bit, but every other word?????  No way.On the other hand, it is an interesting portrayal of what really went on in the Black Hills during the gold rush days, probably quite close to actual events and conditionsI am not a prude, spent almost 20 years in the Navy, and heard lots and lots of profanity, even used some of it myself, but the constant use of vulgar words began to turn me off, and definitely turned my wife off.

There was only one thing I DID NOT LIKE; the language is absolutely awful...very distateful for any woman who still considers herself a lady. But one does get involved with the characters. So we went along watching all three seasons and then found out they NEVER MADE A FOURTH SEASON. IT LEAVES ONE WITH NO ENDING. What a nightmare...of course some of the characters are not real and others are, so we read about ""real"" people and that gave us some satisfaction to know the truth behind the people who actually did live in Deadwood. But I wish I never saw it because it was hard not to have a finale.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AYV4KIIUM2419	"goodoldmac ""goodoldmac"""	"""Deadwood"" is a look at the ""Wild West"" as it really was...more or less.A couple of minor gripes to get out of the way to begin with.  First of all, as you have probably all ready heard, the language is way over the top.  Perhaps the infamous ""F"" word was around back in 1876, (or perhaps not, I've seen research to support both conclusions) but even if it was, it was NOT used as commonly as is protrayed on ""DeadWood.""  It just plain wasn't.  Not even with the people with the foulest of mouths.  But what we have here, I think, is the fact that a) the real Deadwood was a ""wide-open"" town, where anything went, and b) the producer and writers of this show had to find a way to get THAT point across to 21st century audiences, so they choose to use language.  (And honestly, I have always suspected that HBO writers get a bonus for using ""f--k"" over a certain number of times in a show.) Okay so we have language, anthing else?  Well, they do play fast and loose with history just a bit.  Not much, but some.  For an example, Seth Bullock and his partner Sol Starr did not get to Deadwood until the day before Wild Bill Hicock was shot, so Hicock and Bullock probably never met, and neither did they become the close friends they are protrayed here.Okay, that's is out of the way, so what do we have left?  For one thing, absolutely the best job of costuming that I've seen in a long, long time.  And also the best sets as well.  Deadwood was not a clean antiseptic town as you see so often in Westerns, but one where horses (and even people) took dumps in the street, one where mining was being done right in the town's main street, and one where most of the women there were prostitutes.  Deadwood protrays all this accurately.And the casting gets an A+ as well.  Maybe not for Bullock so much, but Ian McShane captures Al Sweringin (who was NOT an Englishman, by the way) and the same applies to Robin Weighert (sp?) who plays Calmity Jane.  And never has the engima that Jane Canary (supposedly her real name) so perfectly captured.  Another example of particularly good casting is Keith Carradine as Wild Bill.  Carradine LOOKS more like the ""real thing,"" than anyone else I have seen take on the role.And the scripts are good, with very little dead time in them, very little, if anything, happening just to fill time.  Each character is well developed, with each of them acting in a way that would perfectly consisent with their character.The complete season 1 is expensive, no doubt about that, but you seldom will buy anything else so throughly entertaining for the same price.  I can hardly wait for season 2 to come out."	5.0	excellent and realistic western series....	2005-09-03	7	6	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A15XNT79BMHKXN	"googleit ""movie buff"""	Just watched the entire 1st season and all I can say is wow.  The writing,acting, and production values on this show are all incredible.Each of the characters is interesting in their own way, with of course Ian McShane's Al Swearingen dominating the proceedings.  Tony Soprano is probably the only other TV character with the same mesmerizing combination of charm, humor, and brutality.  Another standout is Doc, played perfectly by Brad Dourif.The finale contains a sequence involving Doc, Al, and a gravely ill minister that may be the best 5 minutes of television ever produced.As for complaints about the language: yes there is a huge amount of profanity.  If this bothers you then it may affect your enjoyment of the show.  But to me, it added an element of realism to the show, and the combination of courtly 19th-century dialog with relentless profanity highlighted the rough lawlessness of the camp and the people who lived there.	5.0	Possibly the best show on television	2006-06-15	7	4	3

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AIU93YMNWEKI7	"Gordon M. Verber ""Gordon M Verber"""	"""Deadwood"" blasts off with very good opening credit scenes and a nice score. The effort made to create a sense of time and place makes one think that one has found something special. However, ""Deadwood"" then rapidly descends into an abyss of sophomoric swearing, creaking plot, and characters who must be careful not to turn sideways to the camera - least one sees they have only two dimensions.A sense of immediacy was created by the initially unexpectedly appearing extremely violent scenes; yet, with uninspired repetition, these quickly became routine. ""Deadwood"" reminds me of nothing so much as the computer game DOOM-III: dark, predictable, violent, and boring.We tried ""Deadwood"" based on the reviews here which favorably compared it to the, quite excellent, ""Firefly"" series (the only similarity I can see is that both have nice music), to ""Lonesome Dove"" (which, in spite of some production defects attributable to a restricted budget, remains the best made-for-Oz western), and which praised the ""complex"" characters (mistaking, I think, gloom and a hard-stare for complexity).If you are looking for a fun adventure series, then ""Firefly"" is the choice. If it is westerns you are after, I would suggest ""Shane"", ""Lonesome Dove"", and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" If it truly is complexity of character which interests you, then nothing I have seen in a TV series can beat ""Cracker"".A warning about ""Cracker"": It also is violent and macabre - but only in-so-far as is necessary for plot development - and it is saved by having empathetic, multidimensional characters and HUMOR.That is one of the major failings of ""Deadwood"" - no humor: Only resolute, grinding, repetitive, predictable conflict and death.We listened to the commentary, hoping that this might bring some meaning to the production, however, this proved the final nail, and we sent it back without viewing the second episode. The commentator sounded as though he had washed down four Quaaludes with half a case of beer before launching into his disorganized, rambling, unhelpful monotone monologue.In the end that is the problem with ""Deadwood"": it is an unyielding grim, monotonous, predictable, violent, monotone.Pass on this turkey."	1.0	Dead Wood Standing	2005-06-11	112	24	88

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2REQUI85URT87	Great Faulkner's Ghost	"If you started watching Deadwood in its oddly-disjointed second season, you might well wonder why many so many commenters have given it such glowing reviews. It's because Season 1, which is contained on this DVD, is far superior. In writing, acting and originality, Season 1 approaches Sopranos level of dramatic achievement. Thus, I endorse wholeheartedly the many laudatory reviews posted here.However, something that has not been adequately emphasized in previous reviews is the outstanding performance of Keith Carradine as Wild Bill Hickok in the first four episodes. In Carradine's understated portrayal of this mythical American figure, Hickok's popular cowboy/gunslinger image is transformed into that of tragic hero worthy of Graham Greene -- a world-weary, burnt out case who acts heroically and humanely toward others in the face his own hopeless fate -- in this case, the violent, senseless death that looms before him. To his close friend Charlie, who senses Hickok's fate and seeks to save him, Carradine's Hickok implores, ""Why can't you just let a man die the way he wants to""? No easy answer can be given to this problematic question, and the writers have the good sense and restraint not to suggest one.Also notable is Swearingen (played with wicked gusto by Emmy winner Ian McShane), one of the best villains since Shakespeare's' Iago, profane in language, but ironically, the only character with the depth and dimension to search for meaning in Hickok's tragic denouement.The other acting is good, if not quite at the level of Carradine and McShane. All in all, a great series, that will prove exciting, thought provoking, and ultimately, moving."	5.0	Exciting, thought provoking, and often moving	2005-06-15	15	14	1

We have seen in letters from the boys to home during the civil war and WWII that they were eloquent in the use of the language more so than the kids and even adults of present day.The acting was superb. Brad Dourif in his finest performance, Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant were great in there rolls.  The supporting cast did as well most notably W. Earl Brown and Jim Beaver.Deadwood covered the period of time during the ""Gold Rush"" in South Dakota and the legendary James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok excellently portrayed by Keith Carradine.I highly recommend this to lovers of the Western Genre as well as those who never watched."	5.0	Best Western Portrayal	2014-06-01	1	0	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3RCTDHWZ4Y5H5	Gregory Forsythe	As I watch this series of the 'Old West' I have wondered, more then once, if the gold mining camps were so vulgar in their language. I also wondered if the terms they use so freely were part of the American vocabulary. Also part of my wonderment is the treatment of women in this series. I know that women's rights expanded tremendously during the twentieth century, but I cannot imagine witnessing some of the acts committed in this series---they are shameful and consistent---to much so, which portrays the conduct as normal behavior of that society. If that type of conduct can be verified through specific sources I would raise the level to at least four stars.	3.0	Deadwood reality	2014-06-05	0	0	0

I bought the season after viewing it during it's first airing. Incredible to the last! The second season is just as good as the first. It has well-since finished airing with the third season to premiere sometime this year; along with the promise of a fourth season yet to come. Long story short: pay the few extra dollars a month and watch this series AS NEW EPISODES PREMIERE!! If you are still reticent...think of this: you will also get to check out the rest of HBO's great series - The Sopranos, Entourage, Curb Your Enthusiasm and the soon-to-premiere Big Love.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AI5BVNHWOPHNH	Hal C. Bryson	"Simply one of the best series on TV, ever.  Not just within the Western genre.  Ignore the nay-sayers who can't get past the language.  Yes, the language is exceedingly crude, rough, profane, dirty, nasty, repulsive... whatever adjective you want to use.  The solution for folks who are put off by the language is an easy one: don't watch the show.  But don't watch the show a few times, decide you are offended by the profanity, and then decide that by that criterion alone Deadwood deserves a single star.  Go watch your PG- or G-rated series or some mind-numbing reality show if you're looking for clean language (but, of course, there's no guarantee of finding clean language in other TV shows, especially so-called 'reality shows', which simply 'bleep' out the offensive words).  Cursing is part of the human condition.  Is it ""over the top"" in Deadwood, i.e., simply so excessive that it detracts from enjoying this amazing production?  That, of course, if up to individual taste and discretion.This series is characterized by absolutely top-notch writing, acting, cinematography and set design.  The plots -- as complex and veering as they can be -- unfold and inter-twine over the course of weeks (like real life) and offer a compulsively watchable, quasi-operatic story line.  Like a series of interwoven morality plays, supported by fascinating arcs of character development.  A mix of Cormac McCarthy (read Blood Meridian), Shakespeare and bar-room banter.  What's most compelling to me is to see how some of the major (as well as certain seemingly lesser) characters develop over time, how they each in their own way struggle with maintaining some semblance of goodness and compassion in the midst of hellish conditions and unabated evil, violence and pestilence.  Of course, some don't even pretend that they ever had a moral compass to begin with.The entire cast is first-rate, with McShane and Olyphant standing out in their dominant roles.  And don't miss Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, Molly Parker as Alma Garrett or William Sanderson as E.B. Farnum.  The ENTIRE cast is amazing.  Powers Booth, Keith Carradine, Brad Dourif, Dayton Callie, Ray McKinnon, Dan Dority, Kim Dickens, Jeffrey Jones, Paula Malcomson, John Hawkes, etc.  Just an incredibly talented cast at the peak of their skills, and a script equal to their acting talents.  The final episode of Season 1 was nothing short of jaw-dropping.  Watch Seth Bullock (Olyphant) -- always chafing at what he sees transpiring in Deadwood, always simmering with pent up rage -- finally reach his limit and cross a line that can't be uncrossed.  Watch Swearengen (McShane)do what he does best (end lives) with cold calculation and not a scintilla of remorse.  Paradoxically, we see Swearengen also -- in taking another life -- commit perhaps his first truly merciful act. Terrific stuff.Is the language and violence a reasonably accurate depiction of social intercourse in the real-world Old West, in South Dakota in frontier days?  That's for the historians to comment upon, I suppose.  But that question misses the point of dramatic art.  And make no mistake: Deadwood is Art.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AECZ9AJ2GTNI9	Honkwomp	Listen up you hoopleheads! (insulting term from the show)  I love this program.  I wish they would be able to fill the dialogue with a little less cussing and a little more conversation, but I just found out 4 days ago this was in Prime and I have watched 27 episodes of it.  I am going to be very sad when I exhaust what is on Prime.I used to be in the Marines, so I know my share of foul language.  However the show lost a star for the excessive cussing.Cowboys really did not talk like that, more likely to use terms like &#34;tarnation&#34;.  However, words like nincompoop were considered much more profane back in that day, so the producers decided to use modern cusswords in order to preserve the impact of cussing.  Same with the word &#34;hooplehead&#34; which probably did not exist back in the time this series is set.I do not think they needed to use cusswords so much.  Other than that, this is a well written, engaging drama with bits of comedy that made me laugh out loud.  If you can tolerate, or at least overlook the constant stream of expletives, you are gonna love this show.	4.0	Except for the cussing!	2014-06-19	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3NH7PYU4AD5GA	H. Schneider	I knew since a while that I should try and watch this HBO 'Western' series. Now I finally obtained the DVD. I expected some kind of pioneer saga, not knowing too much about the background.I found a pioneer saga alright.But what makes this 12 hour movie truly outstanding is something else: its language! The first thing you notice is that hardly ever a sentence is spoken which does not include the F word, often more than once. Once the shock is settled, which took me maybe 2 minutes, as I don't suffer much from sensitive ears in vulgar environments, and if you have ears for language, you realize that these people speak differently from any known world. They speak as if they had imported their conversational style from Victorian England and from the novels of the time. This could be annoying under different circumstances, but here it did not annoy me at all, rather it produced some kind of enchantment. I felt I needed to repeat the statements made by bad man Al, or by pretty lady Alma, or by good old drunken Calamity Jane, not to forget the working girls in Al's saloon and the camp doctor and the local transport entrepreneur etc. etc.The story: a historical mining camp in Dakota territory after Custer's disaster and before annexation by the US, peopled by real people like Wild Bill Hickock and Calamity Jane plus several other, less familiar but historical names, plus the necessary number of generic characters.

I am in no way a prude, but I found the bad language to be gratuitous, ineffective, and highly distracting. After a while, it sounded like little kids swearing just to show how grown up they are. Similarly for violence. I felt like the makers were trying hard for unusual depictions of physical violence just for the challenge of surpassing previous levels on film.

Not only that, this series was the most vulgar, crude, and disgusting dialog with language that would make a sailor blush.  It appears the director felt it important to lace every conversation with sewage for maximum shock effect.  The effect it had on me was to retrieve the DVD and throw it in the trash.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1YY67KMHOYQAT	J. Anderson	"You want realism of the Old West? Try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they didn't have tissues. Try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair, and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste, so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black.THAT would be realistic, but it's a LOT more repellant to television audiences than gratuitous profanity. So this ""realistic"" show has characters with clean, fluffy hair and pretty teeth spew garbage langauge constantly -- and sucker viewers and reviewers buy this as ""realistic""!!! Every great writer of every age and era, be it Mark Twain, Owen Wister, William Shakespeare, or John Steinbeck, or any other storyteller whose works have survived for generations, told ""realistic"" stories of their era but who understood what realistic trivia to keep in, and what to leave out, in order to TELL THE STORY. That is WHY their work has remained timeless.Deadwood's writing shows a huge insecurity complex in choosing to rely on a gimmick (and a juvenile one at that) like over-the-top profanity. Whether or not the Calamity Janes of the time actually used the words ""ignorant f****ng c***s"" is something we will never know and is also absolutely irrelevant.There are an awful lot of sheeple in TV land."	1.0	A wild, wild gimmick	2006-10-19	111	42	69

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2VRAT69JDAD3W	"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister"""	"The best kept secret on television is Deadwood, a semi-true story of the lawless town in South Dakota that popped up during the gold rush days of the 1800's.  The real Deadwood boasted legendary residents like Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickock.  Both figure prominently as characters in the TV series but are far from the only great characters on display.Perhaps you've heard of the series, but never gave it a look.  Or perhaps you were warned by others that the language was so profane as to render it unwatchable.  True, the series isn't for anyone under the age of 18, but it must be understood that this semi-historical piece was written to represent the actual dialect and social tenor of the region at that time.  Deadwood was a rough place without real law, and gold was on everyone's mind.  All the elements for great drama were there.  Greed, corruption, deceipt, innocence, morality (or a lack thereof), hope, hate, fear, addiction, murder, jealousy and love.  Deadwood truly represents a kind of sociological study of human evolution within a laissez faire society.It was clear from episode 1 that the new Deadwood series on HBO was something special.  By episode 4, I was certain that Emmy nominations/awards were imminent.  The show was largely ignored by the Emmys, likely sufferering from a combination of ""newcomer syndrome"" and overshadowing by The Sopranos.  But make no mistake, it was more than worthy with the actors comprising a splendid balance of the familiar and the unfamiliar.  Regardless of fame however, there isn't an off performance to be found in the season.  Nor is there a grossly derivitive one.  The characters are all satisfyingly deep, nuanced and often downright quirky.The writing, as is the case with most HBO original series, was entirley engaging with a character and rhythm all its own.  It is to be savored as a fine wine or concerto.  Unlike many adult drama series on the ""other networks"", Deadwood never loses its momentum.  There is no need to manipulate the audience with cheap antics to get them to care week to week.  The story, actors and writing take care of that.  Each episode flows to the next with amazing fluidity while always maintaining an anticipatory mood.There is really no need to get into plot points as it would require a review the size of the Deadwood script and would involve spoiling much of the drama that one should experience as purely as possible.  Suffice it to say if you enjoy adult themed series such as The Sopranos, you will love Deadwood.  Even if you don't like westerns, it won't matter.  The acting, writing, and plot are just that good.  Give it a chance.  You won't be sorry."	5.0	Hands down the best series on television in 2004.	2004-11-05	438	415	23

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3LJPQO3DVHNO5	JayCee	I have heard so much about the quality of this production and was eager to see a &#34;really great western series&#34; that was reputed to be authentic and well researched. Well, I could only wade through the mire of profanity for ten or fifteen minutes. The series might be just as I have been told but why is there so much foul language? Are the characters so ignorant that they are unable to use other adjectives besides the &#34;f word&#34;? I am not adverse to hearing profanity in small doses but my word, is it necessary for every other word to be profane? I also do not believe that this type of language was as prevalent then as it is now. The very usage of the &#34;f word&#34; hit it's break-out in popular usage seemingly within the past two generations and I think it is (like most scenes of sexual intercourse in film) gratuitous. If there ever is a version of this series that uses a lot less profanity, I might give it another look.	1.0	Very disappointed!	2014-05-28	17	11	6

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3SJMW269N75IL	Jaylyn	HBO does it again with keeping us addicted to their nighttime dramas. Run much like a pre-America mofia, Deadwood is a raw, unglamorized look into a very real period in time, smoothered with [prostitutes], sweat, mud, blood, gold, greed and a twist of fictional characters mixing with real gun slingers in history in a story perhaps as close to the period as one could imagine.There's alot of displeasure with the language in this series (who knew what a mouth Lovejoy had on him!). Well, if you've enjoyed the Soprano's then the profanity shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone watching HBO series. I find it actually enjoyable to hear the females sling around the filthy words as good as any man. And on the opposite end of the spectrum with characters such as Alma Garret, it's as equally refreshing to hear English spoken properly and respectfully.With it's interesting characters and dark tapestry, Deadwood is a complete pleasure to add to any DVD collectors shelf.	5.0	Sopranos on the prarie	2005-04-22	12	11	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2C5LA07JCDWTN	"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	"Deadwood is nothing short of a revelation. The show captures the grittiest, grimiest aspects of life in and around the Gold Rush era through the happenings of a small mining town. Deadwood is unflinching and uncompromising, which is what makes it easily the best show on television today. Timothy Olyphant plays Seth Bullock, a man of means and morality. He anchors the show from the chaos and anarchy around him. The show's true star is Ian McShane's Al Swearengen. He is complex and dark but you can also see a bit of good in him behind the tough talking facade. Swearengen runs the Gem Saloon, a brothel and for all intensive purposes runs the daily operations of the camp. What amazed me the most was the audacity of the producers to introduce a core character, Wild Bill Hickock, and then kill him off in the middle of the first season. Hickock's death signified to me, a show that holds nothing sacred, it is truly television without rules, outlaw television and you have to admire it. Each character in Deadwood is fascinating in their own way, from E.B. Farnham's deceptive nature to Cy Tolliver's mean streak, the show always brings you the unexpected and keeps you on your toes. Some people will complain about the coarse language and graphic violence but Deadwood is closer to ""reality tv"" than any of these other so called ""reality"" shows eventhough its fiction. Overall, fans of westerns and just good acting, directing and mainly writing should buy this soon to be classic first season on DVD and cherish it. Kudos to HBO for producing a tough, unfiltered nor dumbed down look at the wild west. Highest Recommendation."	5.0	The Only Show that Matters on Television Today...	2005-04-18	10	9	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	ABOQXJBWWCOGA	J. Chow	Even back when I had an HBO subscription I never quite caught on to Deadwood because I was always several episodes into a particular season and I felt lost being plunked into its thick milieu of blood, mud, stylized dialogue and characterizations.  Well, thanks to Prime's recent HBO streaming bounty, I could finally start from the beginning, and I was immediately hooked...big time.  Undoubtedly this is television for the ages and Ian McShane as the proud, profane, murderous yet strangely noble Al Swearengen deserves to be enshrined as one of the all-time greatest TV characters.  Special mention also to William Sanderson who tends to be overlooked amid most of the raves for Deadwood.  Somehow he manages to graft his character (Larry with 2 brothers named Daryl) from The Bob Newhart Show to the old west without missing a beat and becomes the most unctuous, sycophantic, supercilious hotelier (shades of John Cleese AND Newhart) cum mayor ever to grace the small screen and yet remain strangely adorable at the same time.

I just cannot agree with the notion that everyone in town used the word F%&# as every other in their conversations.  Other than that, the costumes are wonderful! The storylines seem very easy to believe.  The characters all fit their parts, I could not imagine anyone else trying to play their parts, except for the people that are in them!  All are suited to their parts they play. Its a great show, and one of my favorites! I just do not reccomend it for ANY children.	5.0	Really The Way It Was?	2014-06-07	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3BUFAGPDKONX1	Jeff Howard	"The way to watch these HBO limited series is one episode after another with no interuptions.  I saw ads for DEADWOOD and heard how great it was, but didn't try it until the first season came out.  What an awesome spectical.  The characters are richly drawn and, for the most part, based on about 90% real people.  I'd heard about the profanity but nothing prepares you for the assault.  You just have to watch and enjoy.It's difficult to single out any particular performance as better than any other, however, Ian McShane as Al Swearingen has a plum role as the Gem Saloon keeper, as he has no laws or rules to tie him down.  You find yourself rooting for him in spite of his overall badness.Tim Olypahnt is Seth Bullock, another real life character of the time.  Mostly moral, but a there is a streak of meanness when it is needed.  Usually called upon when there is an issue of justice or fairness to be metted out and usually with extreme violence.Brad Douriff does not receive much credit in the press for his role as Dr. Cochran, an alcoholic and Civil War veteran who is never satisfied with his limitations.  He always strives to do more than the period allows and BD's acting is top-notch as usual.  Here he has been cast in the role of his career.  Like many of the other characters it is hard to take your eyes off of him.Keith Carridine makes a brief turn as Wild Bill Hickock.  He is killed about 4 episodes in, following a timeline mirroring history.  Carridine's performance is so powerful you will swear that he was in more than just the 4 episodes.  He play Hickock with a real depth that is mesmorizing.The perriferal characters are too numerous to mention, but one of my favorites is Mr. Wu, a Chinese version of Swearingen.  The episode entitled MR. WU is among the most comedic.  Primarily due to the extensive use of the word, ""C---sucker!""  You'll be roling in your seat with laughter.An intense drama, you really have to give each episode your full attention because there is so much going on and all characters are richly drawn.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A23XANQNP4UBYK	"Jeremy ""Cablemonkey"""	"Though i never considered myself a western fan, i realize i've seen a good many, from the Anthony Mann masterpieces, to Leone's revolutionary films, to more recent flicks like Unforgiven. But none has moved me like Deadwood. While the series did have some ups and downs (like life itself), it is truly enchanting. The season one finale alone is one of the most moving things i've seen on TV, and having rewatched it many times (the joy of tivo) i still find myself driven to tears/cheers/jeers. The dialog is fantastic, bordering on Shakespearean at times as others have pointed out. Its a shame that so many seem to be bothered by the language, perhaps i am just overly jaded. Remember though that profanity at that time was predominantly based on religion (or rather defiance of such). These days of course, hellfire and tarnation don't have quite the same effect. If the dialog were more ""period"", i imagine it would be like watching yosemite sam cast as swearengen (heaven forbid). In their translations of Kurasawa movies, Critereon has faced the same issues, and i agree with their and David Milch's choice. Stay true to the meaning and feeling, more than the literal. Especially with profanity, this is key. Profanity's entire purpose is to offend, and if it becomes through age or paradigm shift inoffensive, it loses all meaning and effectiveness. It helps bring us into the world of deadwood, and better understand and relate to the characters who live there. Which, IMHO, is a wondrous thing to experience."	5.0	Western gutter shakespeare	2005-03-09	9	8	1

It's got a lot of violence, and salty language and situations.  That being said, I think that is somewhat necessary in order to depict what it must have been like at that time in that part of the U.S.  The story follows a number of characters around in their daily lives and the situations that occur and where they find them selves relative to that in a mining community in Deadwood.  I won't say much more as to not add spoilers.  If you watch the first one, you'll probably either turn it off part way through or go ahead and watch as many of them as they made, a situation that I now find myself in.	5.0	Well Done!

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2MM8CVDKZPUF7	Joe	I'll get this out of the way right now:I'm no history major or anything of the sort.  I do have a fondness for history, but not as serious as others.  That being said, I think that one needs to keep in mind that this show is what is called a &#34;historical drama&#34;, heavy emphasis on the drama.  People shouldn't criticize it for simply being liberal with historical accuracy and anachronistic language.  While I know the show isn't 100% historically truthful (but how interesting would that be to watch?) it is close enough.  Where it lacked in accuracy, it sparked my interest into finding out more about that time period, specifically the town of Deadwood itself.Well then, onto the quality of the show.  Acting is superb by just about everyone.  Ian McShane, Robin Weigart Timothy Olyphant, Keith Carradine, W. Earl Brown, Bill Sanderson, and Keone Young as Mr. Wu are all superb in this show.  McShane, without a doubt, gives the best performance, likely due to the fact that his character is the best.  The dialogue is excellent, with plenty of monologues not unlike a shakespearean drama.  McShane, Sanderson, and Carradine all have super cool monologues at least twice.  The only character I felt fell a little flat was that of Dayton Callie's Charlie Utter.  I just think he just doesn't deliver and he's basically the same character from SOA except in buckskins.  The setting is neat and the grittiness of the time period is felt by the viewer.Additionally, if you find vulgar language extremely offensive, then don't watch.  Don't give this excellent show a 1 star rating.  I mean, this is an HBO TV show, what'd you expect?	5.0	Awesome Series	2013-08-20	0	0	0

There's a great extras disc that features an interview between director David Milch and Keith Carradine (who delivers an excellent portrayal of Wild Bill Hickok) wherein both discuss what the inhabitants of Deadwood may have actually been like and give plausible explanation to said profanity, etc.  But it's still rough going to sit thru an hour of this and have your family room lacerated by such blue language.	3.0	Was Deadwood really like this?	2013-02-15	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"David Milch, the head writer of the now defunct ABC show ""NYPD Blue"" is the creator of ""Deadwood"" the HBO hit Western-show that recieved notice because of the cussing. And, yes there is a lot of it. The show is one of the most entertaining and well thought out modern westerns I've seen and truly, I don't even like westerns that much. The cast is absolutely spectacular, the characters are well drawn out, the sets are great. The fact that HBO hasn't renewed the actors contracts for a 4th season (yet, I hope) is a damned travesty. Anyway, the show introduces us to a whole array of characters;Seth Bullock (Timothy Olymphant, ""The Girl Next Door""), Sol Star (John Hawkes, ""Me and You and Everyone We Know""), Al Swearengen (Ian McShane, ""Sexy Beast""), Will Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine), Calamity Jane (I'm not sure of the actresses name, but she's great in the role), Doc Cochran (I think it's Brad Dourif, but I'm not positive), Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe, ""U-Turn""), Eddie (Ricky Jay, ""Magnolia""), Trixie, Alma Garrett, and E.B. Farmum; among other names I may have left out. If you haven't watched the show, these names are meaningless...But, I'll give you a quick synopsis of the show (I feel it's best to watch each episode without a preconceived notion of what's going to happen) which I'll follow with some comments on each episode. Seth Bullock and his partner Sol Star move from Montana, where Seth was sheriff, to the Deadwood, South Dakota. Deadwood is a lawless town that features a whole array of misfits. One of them is a saloon owner named Al Swearengen, who controls almost everything in the town and is basically the villain of the series. Right about the time Bullock and Star arrive, Will Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane do as well. Across the street from Swearengen's saloon, another saloon run by the unstable Cy Tolliver opens up and it features something the citizens of Deadwood have not seen before...A craps table, which is managed by Eddie. Meanwhile, Alma Garrett's husband is pressured into selling his gold claim by Swearengen and Farnum and eventually is killed over the debacle. That's about as far as I'll go getting into the series. Here's the episodes and some thoughts:1. Deadwood-Cool pilot episode. Interesting twist at the end and a pretty good cliffhanger.2. Deep Water-The dialouge is better than the 1st episode and it's funnier.3. Reconnoitering the Rim-The first episode on the second disc is a big improvement on the other two episodes. The dialogue here is very well written and witty...Quick question though. Did people in the Old West really say the word ""f**knut""?4. Here Was a Man-Easily the best episode so far and features a well-known historical event involving Wild Bill Hickok.5. The Trial of Jack McCall-Ian McShane gets better every episode. The title of the episode is decieving, because in the end you don't really care about the trial.6. Plague-The dialogue, including that in the final scene, is some of the best...But, this episode is not my favorite of the bunch.7. Bullock Returns to the Camp-My favorite episode so far. It's massively entertaining and has some of the best dialogue so far. Some new characters appear, which is nice.8. Suffer the Little Children-One of the most intense scenes of the entire show haappens here...This is one of the best episodes and they just keep getting better.9. No Other Sons or Daughters-This episode isn't bad, but it's one of the duller episodes...But, it's kind of funny at the same time.10. Mister Wu-The Wu character is very funny,  the first five minutes of the episode were hilarious. You also geet to see Ian McShane's character hit the peak of his evilness.11. Jewel's Boot is Made for Walking-This episode was written by Ricky Jay and involves the handicapped chick Jewel, who works for Swearengen, trying to get a leg brace. Jay obviously knows the show pretty well and the end of the show is great.12. Sold Under Sin-5/5-The final episode is great and I look forward to beginning the second season.Hopefully, this review will inspire a couple people to check this show out. It's one of the best shows HBO has offered. Enjoy.GRADE: A"	5.0	One of HBO's Best Shows	2006-05-30	7	4	3

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2HEV2DBHZX6P4	J Petrille	Having just rewatched the Sopranos and Mad Man, I was in the mood for a high-quality serial drama.  And as a big fan of post-modern westerns like Cormac McCarthy's novels and There Will Be Blood, I figured Deadwood would fit the bill.  Unfortunately, the show disappoints.  All the dialogue is dense bloviation, peppered with profanity.  The actors often don't even seem to understand the words they're reading and the profanity, apparently, isn't historically accurate.  Timothy Olyphant is miscast as a gritty former sheriff prone to violence.Whatever its faults, you have to credit Deadwood for a few truly great performances, especially Ian McShane as an amoral saloonkeeper, pimp and opium peddler.  His voice is as cracked and leathery as an old saddle.  The preacher and doctor are also great, the latter being essentially the doctor character from Kurosawa's Drunken Angel.	2.0	Not up to Sopranos-level	2012-01-03	11	2	9

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1LDSKH5QADFAM	JRH	I've been waiting years to be able to watch Deadwood via streaming, and I'm glad I did. I really can't stand week to week serials with three months or more between seasons. So I hunkered down last weekend and over three days watched all three seasons. What a treat! So many fine characters: Keith Caradine as Wild Bill was deadpan perfect, Robin Weigert was the foul-mouthed drunk with a soft spot for Bill, the children, and the pox victims that I've been hoping to see since I first encountered her in The Plainsman (though I have to admit Ellen Barkin was a turn-on in Wild Bill--too much of a turn-on unfortunately). Gerald McRaney was a coward cold as ice always ready to hire the Pinkertons to do his dirty work. But it was Ian McShane as Al Swearingen who stole the show for me--what a tough, nasty sonofabitch--though Powers Boothe (an actor I've always felt was under-rated) was also fine as a mean dandy with a crush on Tricksie, which never stopped him from beating the hell out of her if he thought she needed it. Loved Charlie Utter too. Rough and uneducated as he was, he seemed to me to be the true moral center of the show. All of which would have led me to give Deadwood 5 stars except for the rather bland performance by Timothy Olyphant, who seemed to express every repressed emotion as though he were about to have a stroke. Too bad this show got cancelled after the third season, but at least the finale was acceptable.Next up: The Pacific, and then a long haul with The Wire.	4.0	Outstanding Portrait of  Lawless Society	2014-06-07	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2LIF7V081BVRX	J. S. Radmer	"First, let me make perfectly clear that I LOVE nearly all the other shows on HBO (Sopranos, Oz, Six Feet Under), so I'm not easily shocked; and, I admittedly have one of the filthiest mouths around. But I have to say that not only is the sheer amount of profanity absurd in this series, but it's literally delivered like Boyz in the Hood! You half expect someone to say ""I'm gonna put a cap in your a_ _!"" Everyone else--whose reviews you read here--who is saying that the dialogue is clearly written to reflect those times are either forgetting that it's supposed to be the 1800's, or they are prone to jumping on the bandwagon when a show is popular.When you're watching a show/movie, especially a period piece--as this is supposed to be--it is absolutely necessary for the people creating the show to make us believe it. The illusion is shattered when we're not buying it. e.g. The Matrix would've been a joke if you could see the body wires. In the case of Deadwood, the characters all swear copiously to the point of being boring, but what's FAR, FAR WORSE is the WAY they curse!!! The types of phrasing, wording, and style they use is EXACTLY identical to how you hear contemporary street gangsters talk today! You never get the impression that these are people living in a time well over 100 years ago. They sound like a bunch of teenagers from the MTV generation wrote the teleplay! Don't believe me? Think I'm exaggerating? Rent it and find out for yourself.I'm really disappointed in how many people/critics alike are giving this extraordinarily unrealistic language a pass!! To repeat, it's not the language itself that offends me. It's the total and complete lack of realism that it gives the whole proceeding! By the time I was done watching 2 episodes I could ""see the body wires"" and it just looked to me like grown people playing dress up."	1.0	THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES	2005-08-13	110	35	75

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1EEG0A4AAHABG	Julia	My husband purchased the first season of Deadwood at the beginning of the year, and for the first several episodes I was not interested.  I heard it was a western, which I've just not cared for much in the past.  But by the fourth viewing, I found myself passing by the TV and just captivated by this show.  The story line, the characters, the way these people are talking to each other was just brilliant.  Legendary folks like Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickock - I'd heard of these people but watching Deadwood brought their legend to life.  Now I know it's television, and it is David Milch's interpretation of how the town of Deadwood came to be, but I have to say I enjoy his portrayal of this western more than any movie or other TV show I've seen.We do not have cable or local television, and for very good reasons.  But this is the type of show you find yourself thinking about the characters the day after viewing an episode.  It is comical at times, in sometimes subtle ways that I don't even get until I watch it a second time.  And the acting is of excellent quality across the board.We have since watched this series four times, and have several of our friends hooked on it as well.  It is that good and that much complexity to soak up in each episode.  I highly recommend this DVD series, and can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD.	5.0	Brilliant and Captivating . . .	2005-12-02	5	5	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A8QG61LYK0XO1	JUST A REVIEWER2	McShane's Swearengen is a sledge hammer, albeit an extremely good and complex one.....yet it is Olyphant's Seth Bullock who is the steady heartbeat of this marvelous series.As for all those viewers and reviewers who believe John Wayne's westerns truly reflect the behavior and language used in this county's Old West, well, all that can be said is that they have an awful lot of growing up and l'arning to do.  They apparently want their morals to be to be substituted for those which actually existed in our country at that earlier time.  Perhaps, if time travel really existed, these folks could go back and somehow change the manner in which this country's citizens of that era actually spoke and behaved.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AF6I17HGN55DC	"J. Ward ""musical connoisseur"""	"Let me preface this critique by saying that I don't have my TV hooked up to receive any TV programs. That said, my partner and I decided to rent this series in the dull grey moths of winter, and we both fell in love with it. Never have I found a more authentic portrayal of the ""Wild West."" Generally speaking, westerns seem to combine too many parts kiddy western, lame plots, boring and/or undefined characters, and inacurate history. Deadwood is none of these, but instead feels so authentic you feel the gold dust in your lungs and the dirt under your fingernails. I'm rather a history buff, and really get snobby when dramatizations fall short of the grandeur of the actual event. Deadwood delivers again. Never has American history been so exciting! In other critics' defenses I will admit that the very first episode is a bit hard to follow...as with ANY series, TV or otherwise. I was so impressed with HBO (and so devistated when we discovered they were discontinuing the series) that my partner and I got hooked on Rome, the other big deal show. Almost as good, but Deadwood gets you in your gut. I got so turned on to the series, in fact, that I hesitatingly told my parents, my dad having grown up on kiddy westerns and searching for a certain...something in other ""westerns."" They both fell for Deadwood as hard as my partner and I did. So go forth, enjoy, sink your teeth into something gritty, gripping, and golden.

Other than that it's a good show.My complaint is with missing parts from the box.I ordered this from COMP-U-PLUS ROCKLAND INC.  Apparently there is not any QA on items that are shipped from this place - so beware this vendor.  I got this DVD set and Disc 2 was completely missing from the set!To be fair to Amazon, when I contacted their customer service they resolved the issue extremely quickly by giving me the option of either a full refund or a partial refund.  Since the partial refund would cover renting the missing episodes on Video On Demand I opted for that vs. the full refund route in which case I would have to repackage everything, take it to the P.O., etc.  Not optimal as I won't really be able to resell this set, but a relatively acceptable solution under the circumstances.

And I *want* to continue loving it!!Yes, it's the swearing that prevents it from being 5 stars, but I have different reasons for taking umbrage at the use of nonstop f*cking, c*cks*cker, and m*therf*cker.  I write historical fiction and it was the most grating thing when I first heard this language--because it's completely anachronistic!!!  F*cking as an intensifier wasn't used till 1893, and Deadwood takes place in 1867.  Of the other 2, one wasn't until the 1890s, and the other not till the 1950s!!!For someone who does this night and day for a living, hearing these anachronistic terms just rips me out of the story. When I watch historicals I like to lose myself in the story, not be torn out of it--in this case every thirty seconds!!  The writer swore :):) he did his research.  Yes, people did swear back then, but it was of a different flavor entirely.  If you read civil war letters, they're full of non-bleepable things like ""son of a bitch,"" ""god damned,"" and ""suck my arse.""  The screenwriter just failed to walk three feet over to his slang dictionary. I've never seen one historical document where people used this language in 1867.Other than that--LOVE IAN McSHANE!!!

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2VFLP9SM3D45W	Keith Liskey	"This is a very interesting story. It is probably a far more accurate depiction of the west than the standard ""westerns"" I have seen since I was a child.  The dialogue is generally very rich and intelligent.  The one drawback is the vulgarity.  I am not opposed to any amount of vulgarity if it seems to fit the story.  For example I really like The Sopranos where the vulgarity is obviously necessary to the reality of the show and the ""family"".  In Deadwood, while it may be historically accurate, I actually find it distracting and overbearing. It is hard to believe that anyone would use the F word that much, particularly when many of the characters who use it are so otherwise articulate. Finally, the entertainment value of Deadwood probably suffers somewhat due to the bleakness and meanness of the people's existance.  Everything is dark, the streets are mud and dung, and very few happy or uplifting things occur.  That is probably the way it was, but don't expect to feel ""cheered up"" by this story."	4.0	Deadwood - Season 1	2007-07-23	7	2	5

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3EECDEYYZE84F	kleetus	The writing and character development on this show are among the best ever on TV. Unfortunately for Deadwood, we are in the golden age of television and the competition is dizzying! There are only three seasons, but I wish there were 30. Between season one and season two, the dialog became evermore sophisticated. Season one's dialog was vastly more colloquial. Season two and three conveyed prose that surprising easy to understand despite the lack of modern day idioms and structure. Like The Wire, I found myself mimicking the sentence structure in my own writing and speech. Delicious from the first season. I love the story telling! This show does something that few do. The protagonist is of course, deeply flawed, but I would not call him an anti-hero. He spends a lot of time off screen. I make the point that one of the villains in this show is the real star. This achieves the plot device of creating conflict as a true anti-hero would in a show like The Sopranos. Life, as depicted on the show, is highly nuanced. Your early impulse is righteous indignation over the immense cruelty displayed in nearly every scene. But, you see the divine nature of what makes us and them human as well. The characters on Deadwood get a pass because of the difficulty of their lives from day to day. We know, instinctively, that nature's justice is right around the corner for all of them. It is a beautiful thing to behold; them living so close to the unmerciful wild west.	5.0	my third favorite show, but still top notch	2014-06-04	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A106UIA58TIBA9	"KLW ""***"""	"So many people seem to have an ignorant, dismissive opinion of this show based on the language.  Yes, it does take a little while to tune into, but you might want to consider doing a little homework before you shoot your mouth off about it being dumb, trivial, or especially  ""unrealistic"".Milch painstakingly researched the history of the period and the kind of language used, and in fact a large part of the show's project is about how the use of such language fits into a scenario where people are trying to establish order and civilization in a brutal, wild area.  The amount of swearing in gold rush areas like Deadwood was huge and there were many reasons for it.  One of the big ones is that the same words could be used in a variety of contexts to convey emotion and intention without having to reveal anything about oneself in terms of content, which could be dangerous.  In a place like Deadwood, revealing personal information incautiously could quickly get you killed.He substituted contemporary swear words for antiquated ones because the old-fashioned ones would sound silly to us, and would add an element of unintentional comedy that would detract from the drama.  For instance, I believe ""dern"" was a fairly filthy word back then.  How scary is it going to be if a ruthless killer gets mad and calls someone a ""dern hornswaggler"" or somesuch?  Contemporary swear words are able to have a wide variety of often visceral effects on us as viewers, which is the whole point.  Think of it as transliteration.Overall, if you stick with it, you will find the language masterful and mesmerizing.  I often stopped and rewound on my Tivo to hear a choice speech or phrase several times in a row.Likewise, the rest of the elements of the show are all at the highest level I have ever seen for a period drama, tv or movie: sets, costumes, cinematography, lighting, acting, orchestration of dramatic tension, and so on.  Basically, if you can't get past your initial knee-jerk reaction to Deadwood's unusual dialogue, you don't deserve Deadwood."	5.0	Often misunderstood, brilliant show	2008-06-09	6	5	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2QJVTO0T8NMND	"K. M. Blanchard ""The real word!"""	Too grim, too depressing!And there's a lot of bad language!I also  think that the bad language expressed in this production was not as real as some people might say it was for that time period!But excepting bad language in this production is one thing, but it doesn't necessary mean that it makes the production any more worthy of being a hit show.Also the other thing I didn't like about the show was in how badly they treated women.Women in the wild west were a rare commodity ,so they were often well respected and looked after, but in this depiction there was nothing but disrespect! So how real was this depiction??Not very. Give this a miss!After seeing the first five episodes I can now see why this never won any awards.I never finished it myself and have gone on to better things! I  am now very weary of those 5 star reviews that I come across all the time!A total waste of 74.00 dollars!	1.0	Crap!!!!!!	2005-11-06	101	11	90
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2WEAVGLLX1K2F	K. Miller	The series is hardcore in your face and realistic.The profanity might offend some, but from the first episode, I couldn't stop. I'm so disappointed HBO didn't follow through to another season.The show is set in the 1870s in Deadwood, South Dakota, before and after the area's annexation by the Dakota Territory. The series charts Deadwood's growth from camp to town, incorporating themes ranging from the formation of communities to western capitalism.Characters such as Wild Bill Hickok,Wyatt Earp,Calamity Jane and George Hearst boosted realistic but likely stretched truths of actual events.Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) sweeps the show in a roll that seems David Milch custom wrote for him (and he rules it!) as Saloon Keeper/Brothel and the behind closed doors boss of the town with Sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant,who also ruled it!) both along with E.B. Farnum were authentic historically acurate characters. Loved it!	5.0	A Blockbuster for David Milch and Ian McShane,Tim Olyphant	2011-06-02	5	5	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3LF8AUKCA5HTR	koolkitty	I loved Deadwood! Great series to binge watch. I love Timothy Olyphant, although there are so many characters and plot lines he doesn't get anymore screen time than main characters. However, I thought he was drool worthy amazing in the first couple of seasons of Justified, but didn't feel he was as magnetic in Deadwood. The plots can get complicated, but not Game of Thrones complicated and the built steadily and most of them wrapped up with a reminder in each episode.I find it just fascinating to see such a well done historical piece of that time period.

There is great acting, the story line is interesting, and they throw in historic characters as well such as Wild Bill and Calamity Jane.  Timothy Olyphant is delicious as the main character.  I found the show funny, shocking, and enthralling.  Overall, as a western genre fan, I rate this show at 4 stars.

Swanson	"""God bless you, Mister Swearengen!""""Well, not likely.But my short term prospects just improved.""A completely separate beast from all other tv westerns, Deadwood sparkles with superior writing, direction, and performances, especially Ian McShane's beguilingly nasty turn as Jim Swearengen.I watched a bit of this on HBO in 2004 then decided to wait to see it all at once on dvd. Glad I did, for the whole series plays out as well as The Sopranos. Compulsively watchable, a mixed delight of humor and horror, Deadwood is yet another bar-raising series from HBO, whose shows are so far ahead of normal tv that it seems something of a joke.I love old westerns, and this takes all the tropes and ratchets them up a notch or three. The language seems at last to be, after so many sanitized westerns, what you would have really heard back then. It's all so believable and yet so well-paced and crisply penned that there's nothing left to ask for: you just sit back and marvel.If you like westerns at all, or just excellent writing and fine dramatic craft, this is one not to be missed.And hey, casting agents of Hollywood: McShane is one of the very best character players alive. What are you doing throwing him bit parts in stuff like Death Race? He should be leading man in any number of big budget movies. The guy has the goods.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2RZTPW5P0ZQGC	Kurt	I had heard that the producers said that the frontier people used profanity extensively but obviously profanity as spoken in the late 1800's.  They said they updated and used modern words and phrases to get the feel of it.  It seriously distracts from the story and you have to catch you self wondering if you are watching some sci-fi picture in which modern people are transported to the 1800's.  Doesn't work well.  I love how both versions of True Grit stayed true to the language of the original book.  I think the show would have been much, much, better if they would have used period correct language.  The challenge for the actors would have been to deliver it so that we knew it was profanity.  I won't be buying the rest of the series, too bad, I had high hopes.	2.0	Use of extensive modern profanity totally distracts from the story...	2013-01-21	4	2	2

At that time, it was being ran on HBO and could be purchased on Amazon per episode but, It was not appealing enough to me to pay all the extra money since we do not have cable. I was thrilled when I seen it available with Amazon Prime since we do subscribe to it. So far, we have watched the 1rst 4 episodes and are very interested. While we were in Deadwood, SD, we took a guided tour. The guide mentioned the series and said there was a lot of truth to some of the stories. The only thing I don't care for is the foul language and nudity. But, that is probably close to the way it really was in Deadwood back in the late 1800's.	4.0	Love wild west shows	2014-06-03	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"Of all of the HBO series that I have watched in their entirety, I think ""Deadwood"" is the weakest of the lot (the other are ""The Sopranos,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" and ""Carniv&agrave;le"").  However, before I convince you this is damning with faint praise I would add that ""Deadwood"" is one of the ten best shows on television and that it has one of the most captivating characters around with Ian McShane's Al Swearengen, the profane overlord of the frontier town as the owner of the Gem Saloon.  Ironically, Al is so good at being bad, with his fingers in every pie in town and always looking for more, that he ends up dominating all of his scenes and all of the other characters.""Deadwood"" was created by David Milch, who always gets mentioned as being the creator of ""NYPD Blue,"" but whom I always laud as the writer of ""Trial by Fury,"" the third season premier episode of ""Hill Street Blues,"" which remains on my personal list of ten best television episodes I have ever seen.  To jog your memory, it is the one where a nun is raped and murdered and Frank Furillo coerces a confession from one of the killers by threatening to drop charges and have them released to an angry public.  The threat was of vigilante justice, which is certainly an element of ""Deadwood.""The time is 1876, which is when the nation's centennial was soured by the news of Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn.  Deadwood is in the South Dakota Territory, where statehood threatens to bring law and order, which the locals consider more of a threat than Indian attack.  The men play cards, get drunk, and dream of mining for gold, which allows them to indulge in more gambling, drinking, with money left over for buying the services of a woman for a night as well.  This is not the glorious West of Manifest Destiny or even Frederick Jackson Turner's Frontier Thesis, but a cesspool of human existence that is the gateway to the gold of the Black Hills.Our entry into this world is the arrival Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), a former lawman from Montana who arrives with his buddy, Sol Starr (John Hawkes), intending to open by a hardware business and make their fortune off those who want to make their own by mining for gold.  They have to deal with Swearengen to get their operation going, but Bullock becomes acquainted with Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine).  Circumstances force the pair together a couple of times and they are similar in temperament, morals, and ability to shoot a gun and they become friendly, but not friends.  Of course, if there is one thing we know about Wild Bill, it is that he is no long for this world.Also in this world are some rather interesting women, especially Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), who is the second most fascinating character on the show.  She loves Wild Bill even though it will never be reciprocated and when he plays his last hand of poker (two pairs, black aces and black eights) she has to find a new reason for living.  Then there is Trixie (Paula Malcomson)  a prostitute who ends up caring for a young girl who is suddenly orphaned by one of Swearengen's machinations, and Alma Garret (Molly Parker), who comes from the East with her husband and suddenly finds herself a widow and a claim that might not be worthless.  If you want to talk about the most desperate women on television, then check out this trio.In Milch's Deadwood the vermin are always interesting and my attention is most drawn to the Brad Dourif's Doc Cochran, who stubbornly insists on doing the right thing in a  world where right and wrong are irrelevant concepts, and William Sanderson as Eustis Baily (E.B.) Farnum, who thinks obsequiousness translates into something that somehow approaches confidence in the service of Al Swearengen.  Everything in Deadwood comes back to Swearengen, literally.  We get the feeling that Bullock is supposed to be the force for good to counter Swearengen in Deadwood, but we have no reason to believe they are in the same league.  Powers Booth shows up as Tolliver, ostensibly Swearengen's new competition in the saloon business, but we do not think he stands a chance either.The only thing more omnipresent that Swearengen and his assorted interests on ""Deadwood"" is the constant swearing.  For Swearengen profanity is not just an art form but necessary verbal punctuation, and for many of the characters swearing is on a par with breathing (especially for Calamity Jane).  Milch research the historic Deadwood and has justified the language on that basis, but the profanity is part of the texture, as much as the art design, the sets, and the costumes.  If you want a constant reminder that the rules of civilization do not apply here, then all the foul language suffices.  I bet the demographics on this show skew more male than ""Monday Night Football.""Ultimately, with this HBO series the comparison is not to network television shows but rather the genre of the Adult Western that can be traced back to ""High Noon"" and ""Shane.""  But Milch pushes it to a time and place that predates those particular morality plays.  Those mortals stupid enough to want to have a civilized impulse in a place like Deadwood quickly learn to hide it or sublimate it in some way that might keep them alive another day.  In the end, the dreamers in Deadwood are not the ones who picture personal riches, the benefits of statehood, or a honest man wearing a badge bringing law and order to this hell hole, but those wretched individuals who actually think they will live to see another day and that such a day might be worth living."	5.0	"David Milch turns ""Deadwood"" into the Wild Wicked West"	2004-12-19	201	170	31

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A383PPSVXNB0NB	Leigh Fitzpatrick	"My wife and I really like the first season.  Set in a mining camp in the Dakota territory, the series brings together good guys, bad guys, and others whose ultimate motives are revealed in very clever ways.  The 'feel' of the series is authentic, with muddy streets, realistic clothing and dialog.One thing we love about the series is that the characters are extremely complex.  I said earlier that the series has its good guys and bad guys and while that's true, the actors bring out layers of complexity in their characters that at times you empathize with the bad guys while the good guys reveal through their actions and words a kind of hypocrisy.  It's fascinating.Case in point is the character of Al Swearengen, a blood soaked, larger than life criminal and owner of the Gem Saloon who adheres to the ""knowlege is power"" credo....his informants seem to be everywhere.  Brutal, profane, and cruel, the writers use clever devices to bring out his backstory with its own take on the nurture versus nature debate.  He is also capable of surprising compassion.  Ian McShane's portrayal of this complex character is masterful.On the flip side is Seth Bullock, one of Deadwood's `good guys.'  Yet there is no white hat here....the former marshal possesses a hair trigger temper, a streak of brutality, and a moral code that can get rather muddy.Many of the secondary characters are just as riveting as the headliners.  E.B. Farnum, owner of the town's hotel and Swearengen's lackey, is like gum on the shoe that you can't scrape off.  He pokes his nose into everything and after a while you wonder about who is playing who. Farnum isn't revealing everything he knows or what his ultimate motives are.  Dan Dority, Swearengen's heavy, is another character who, despite his thuggish trade, is capable of tenderness and mercy.The bottom line here is that all of these characters feel fully developed and full-blooded.  It's a fascinating study of life in the old West.The ""But"" here is the language....one of the hot topics in these reviews.  Unfortunately, I've noticed that the reviewers who take umbrage at any critique of the profanity do so under the unthinking assumption that objections to profanity must be morality based, and that's not always true.  My wife and I are not prudes and we understand that the mining camps were wild and profane places. But sometimes it feels like David Milch, finally free of network television's constraints, writes like a kid joyfully spewing swearwords because his parents are nowhere around. At times it feels forced and overdone. We get that the camps were profane places....but the swearing sometimes is more of a distraction than a needed tone setter.  It detracts from some otherwise great dialog."	4.0	"Complex and fascinating series, with a small ""but"""	2005-03-15	12	9	3

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2Q8IZ9WMUW7DW	"L. Travis ""KJ"""	Reading these reviews, almost all are either 5 or 1 star, depending on a viewer's sensitivity to profanity. Many of the profanity bashers claim the dialogue is unrealistic, while the show's fans rave about how great the dialogue is.Here's the truth: Both sides are right.Milch justifies the profanity by noting Deadwood was often cited as having foul-mouthed citizens. But they were foul by 1880s standards, not by the modern standards he employs. Furthermore, Milch combines the profanity with a kind of Shakespearean structure of speech.So are these Elizabethan criminals accurate/realistic? Nope, not in the slightest.But what's not to love about them? The dialogue is flat-out brilliant and ever-quotable. So, no, not realistic. But if you're a fan of language (and by 'language' I mean the way words can be used as tools and weapons, both subtle and blunt), you'll love this show.	5.0	Both sides are right	2005-11-25	7	5	2

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2QK8PLBNA478N	"LVX ""rosy-cross"""	"Perhaps the most amazing thing about ""Deadwood"" is the incredible sense of place that director David Milch conveys with every scene.  You could almost say that the mining camp itself is really the star of this series.  Beautiful scenery, lavish sets, an impressive ensemble cast, scores of extras, and a script riddled with harsh profanity all serve to remind the viewer-- often with all the delicacy of a sledgehammer-- that ""Deadwood"" really is a place apart from the 'wild wild west' depicted in other western films.Yes, the language in ""Deadwood"" is vile, crude, and filthy-- but ironically, it's also lyrical.  In fact, you won't find the English language used with as much wit or finesse anywhere else on television, unless Shakespeare happens to be on PBS.  I understand that the profanity is a big turn-off for some viewers, but the language in this show is a lot like life in the mining camp itself: there really is ""gold in them thar hills,"" but to harvest a few flakes of gold you have to pan through tons and tons of muck and river filth.The acting in this series is uniformly brilliant!  Ian McShane stands out in the role of the murderously seedy Al Swearingen, Robin Weigert delivers a brilliant comically-tragic performance as Calamity Jane, and, of course, Keith Carradine's all-too-brief appearance as the tired and world-weary Wild Bill Hickok is something you'll never forget... but Timothy Olyphant, Powers Booth, Molly Parker, Brad Dourif, Dayton Callie, W. Earl Brown, Leon Rippy, Geri Jewell, and just about every other member of the cast (both lead and supporting) also turn in memorable performances.  This really is as solid an ensemble cast as you're likely to see anywhere!My biggest criticism of ""Deadwood"" is that (at times) the pacing seems to be a bit off.  While important events and plot developments take place in each of the twelve episodes, sometimes it seems like the story only picked up a full head of steam in three or four of them.  This didn't trouble me greatly, as I felt that Milch did an incredible job of maintaining suspense throughout the entire season, but I'm also completely sympathetic to other reviewers who've complained about the series' relatively slow pace.I was also underwhelmed with the extras on this DVD set.  While this set is reasonably generous with commentaries (four of the twelve episodes have director and/or actor commentary), the remaining features pretty much consist of long dialogues between David Carradine and David Milch.  I would have greatly preferred a mini-documentary about the 'real' Deadwood to David Milch's take on historical events.That said, ""Deadwood"" is one of the best new shows on a network already known for its great programming.  HBO is to be congratulated for adding another quality series to its lineup!""God grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted; to understand, rather than be understood; to love, rather than be loved... and the rest I forget.""  --Reverend Smith"	5.0	Calling all Heathens and Hoople-heads!!!	2005-03-25	5	4	1

David Milch may have not been successful with John From Cincinnati but this show includes all his favorite elements in a successful venue.  The story of a town full of bad/good/in-between guys and gals.  We have miners, hardware store owners, gamblers, prostitutes and ladies all trying to make a living in an illegally created town.  The lure is gold and it makes for a very alluring setting for interesting characters - some real and some fictional, all very mythical.	5.0	Will You Let Me Go to Hell the Way I Want To?	2007-10-13	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A18S2VGUH9SCV5	Margaux Paschke	This series portrays the Western Frontier in a very unique way.  If extremely rude langauge and nudity offends you - do not watch this show.  Some question it's heavy use and felt it deterred from the story but I feel it added to the whole feel of the piece - the real grittiness of the move westward and what pioneering really meant.  Another tip for deciding whether to watch this show is to be prepared to think.  Every episode requires your full attention to follow the distinct language used (an artful mix of crude and erudite) as well as the numerous plotlines and characters connected to and intermixed with each.  This show was casted by a GENIUS.  There are no two-dimensional characters here, even the stereotypes are fascinating.  Ian McShane as the resident bad guy is brilliant and not so bad as we keep viewing the series and although it is hard to equal McShane's larger then life character, Timothy Olyphant as the good guy who treads the line does his best.  The surrounding characters are many and equally great and just plain fascinating.  I won't go into each and every character but every one shines - I mean who else would place a physically challenged actress in a role that gets no quarter and asks for none and makes the audience look for more (remember Gerri from Facts of Life?) or have Calamity Jane show her historic colors and not the folklored version?  And while not having these characters demeaned in any way by using these techniques show off the beauty of this one-of-a-kind show.  This series has all the usual elements (good vs. bad, love interests, plot twists, etc.) but it relays it with such masterful strokes that the viewer can't help but be awed...  Made me wonder at the tenacity and strength of character - either admired or not - it must have took to form this country of ours and where have all the real people gone?	5.0	BRILLIANT TV VIEWING	2006-09-22	6	5	1

Be ready for drama, violence, humor, sex, and profanity all mixed into 12 episodes.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	ADE3SMS228EM3	Mark K. Bennett	David Milch's modern retelling of the Black Hills Gold Rush is as compelling as it is raw and realistic. On HBO, and not censored in any way as it would be on commercial television, it provides us with a more honest rendering of how human beings live and act. This first season you'll be shaking your head wondering if the crazed Gold Rush Days could have been so outrageous. Right off I compared it to Gunsmoke, a similar tale written and produced for television nearly a half century ago. I think we're seeing things more clearly today. I think our artists have more leeway and their audiences won't sit still for the kitschification of human experience.	5.0	Deadwood - The First Season	2006-11-04	2	2	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2W62UWMS8P14U	Mark Narmore	"Deadwood is quite frankly one of the most incredibly written, acted, and produced shows ever to air on television.  That may sound like hyperbole, and perhaps it is, but there's not another show I've ever seen to which it compares in quality on all three of those aspects.That said, clearly the most oft used critique of the show, or reason many won't watch, is the profanity.  Granted, those with ""soft stomachs"" for such language will have trouble getting comfortable with it, but to those in that boat, I'll submit that it's well worth soldiering through and just letting that wash over you to get to the root story.  Aside from the profanity, the actual import of what is being said, and how it's said, simply cannot be cast to the side as drivel.  Every word drives a character or storyline forward, and is formed in a speech pattern that is unique to this show.  Storylines are woven intricately, carefully, and with a virtuosity rarely seen.  The fact that there's an element of truth to much of it only adds dramatic tension as you spend much of the show trying to imagine living in the town knowing some of these people actually did.It's a crime this show didn't continue past season 3, and it took me a long time to get over that fact, but at least it never got bad, and I'm thankful for 36 superb episodes.  And the final 2 episodes of season 1 in particular are just about perfect.To the DVD set, it's very well done.  The documentaries on disc 6 are excellent and do help viewers understand more about the world upon which this show is based.  It was a very different time and lifestyle than we know today.  Plus, I really enjoyed hearing the Keith Carradine interview.  He's mesmerizing as the troubled Wild Bill Hickok, and adds weight to the characters of Charlie Utter and Calamity Jane.I urge anyone who enjoys engrossing television to give this one a chance.  You won't be disappointed!"	5.0	One must look past the profanity to recognize this masterpiece of a show.	2013-02-20	0	0	0

There was very serious cussing in just about every other sentence, which I found quite distracting for me.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AXLXU4LMIRO3F	MartialWay	"So many people like this show; I should just leave the people who don't alone. The complaints I've read here are justified, certainly, but coming from people that can't seem to get past the cursing. Is that the only problem?It's okay to be set in your ways, used to the old fashioned vision of the ""old west"". It's okay to argue that people didn't talk like that, even though they did and still do. Perhaps not with the poetic brio they speak with in ""Deadwood"" but I know a few people who swear every other word--- I bet you do too. In fact you probably swear without even realizing that you're doing it, which is the mindset of the characters in Deadwood. These people aren't swearing as much as they are simply talking. They have tough backgrounds, and are eking out a living in a tough and dirty place. If they can't swear they can't talk.Did the cultured and educated Brom Garret and his wife Alma swear throughout the first season? No. Those characters were raised in high society, away from such brutish talk. In fact I learned a few new words listening to their dialogue. There is little that is unrealistic about the language in Deadwood in terms of the ""f(beep)ks"", ""c(beep)nts"" and the ""c(beep)k-suckers"". It not what they say that makes Deadwood's dialogue special, it's the way they do it. And yes there is a Shakespearean theatricality about it... it's a drama.People think of that period, ""the old west"", as a wild, romantic, kind of chivalrous time-the old west Hollywood created, where guys in black hats face off with guys in white hats on a deserted street, save for the tumbleweed that rolls past in the dusty breeze and Indians and Mexicans were bad. Movies of the past, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and soforth, were great films, great stories told their way in their time. Today, watching some of them would insult our intelligence (like Natalie Wood, the whitest woman ever, playing a Native American). Did you know that the ""high-noon showdown"" or the ""quick-draw"" duels we know originated from Japanese samurai films? The face off at sunset never happened in those days, the quick draw is a Hollywood creation. The Samurai probably never had quick draws either! It's all bulls(beep)t! Go figure. Ahh but I digress..The bottom line is that you can't argue about what ""really happened"" and you certainly can't say ""this isn't how people talked back then"". We weren't there, and no one alive today was (and if they are they probably wouldn't remember anyway). How many people speak in real life the way they do on ANY tv show (except reality tv---which is what drives most of us to HBO in the frist place). It's drama, liturature, it's entertainment.These characters are complex in spite of their lowly use of expletives. This show is more of a political drama than a Wild West film, presented as close to what the real place may have actually been like. There are gross historical inaccuracies, but it's not a history lesson. It's a drama.Can they rope in the cursing? Yeah. Why though? It's HBO. It's not for kids, or conservatives. You can take it or leave it, like all television. This ones a taker, and a keeper.Many thanks for reading my worthless opinion."	5.0	Deadwood is a dirty, gritty, pull-no-punches treat	2005-11-04	10	9	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1J9GTON38IMDE	marvista2004	"This harsh and brutal show will offend many with its bracing violence and language, but underneath lies a deep, rich vein of lyricism.Viewers may need to see four or more episodes before appreciating ""Deadwood.""  Like a work by David Mamet, Tom Stoppard or Quentin Tarantino, it takes time to get attuned to the cadence and rhythm of Deadwood, including the stylized Victorian dialogue that might be called ""Deadwood-speak.""The brilliant interplay of words, ideas, and characters throughout the series, though, ultimately make the viewing experience rewarding and worthwhile. Al Swearengen (played by Ian McShane) is arguably one of the most powerful characters ever to appear in a TV series, in the same league as (or even surpassing) Tony Soprano.What is refreshingly different about ""Deadwood"" is that it does not seek to be ""liked"" by a mass audience but rather appreciated by careful viewers.  Watching ""Deadwood"" is often an uncomfortable experience - starting from the opening scene of the first episode - but this provocative, disturbing series taken as a whole thoroughly satisfies in its extended study of human nature.""Deadwood"" does not offer its viewers the easy pleasures of a saloon, brothel, or gambling hall - on the contrary, it extends an invitation to take up a pickaxe and explore its bonanza of a claim."	5.0	Deep, Rich Vein of Lyricism Underneath the Brutality	2005-02-28	13	12	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2PI0IGPBQZZKL	Matt	"This 1st season was an impressionable experience, I'd agree that it most likely was one of the best shows of 2004. I watched it, not long after it was out and have to say that the first few seasons were excellent and it gradually started to weaken as the seasons continued. My wife and I had a good conversation about how often the show comes to mind when we think of the last 10 years of epic television.I read all the 1 star votes, almost every one was in response to the language, ultra violence, maybe some perceived misogyny. So the warning is:This is not ""Little House on the Prairie""....these are people(mostly men) that went to Deadwood to do one thing, get filthy rich quick with little if any scruples. Be prepared to be shocked. (Although there's been some shocking television in since then that might out shock you)"	5.0	An excellent western for a modern age!

Why do they charge you full price for incomplete art and does not offer you a full refund under these circumstances...that is, they were selling you something before it was cancelled, but after they knew it was cancelled, why they still try to sell it to you at full price, knowing it has no end, without any warning whatsoever!!!!	1.0	HAS NO END.

I have no issue with language, but if that is what you need to get ratings, then it must suck to be you.  Maybe next time the writers could be more creative and leave out the F bombs and that C word.  A little less blood wouldn't hurt either.  After mostly watching all 3 series (I started playing games and just listen to most of them in the background) there is no resolution.  Guess writer/producer was running out of money.

Almost every negative review has focused on the prevalence of the ""f-word"" and other gritty language...newsflash everyone, people actually talked like that. The fantastic thing about HBO is its ability to emulate reality, without having to work within the confines of network censorship.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1IXIVMGH52BS	"Michael R Hodges ""Hodgie Babba"""	Really enjoyed it!  A bit like The Sopranos set in a western boom town - the story revolves around a saloon/ brothel owner( the mob boss). The language is at one moment Poetic and the next filthy.  The violence is brutal but, the characters have a human quality that draws your empathy for their situation.  The thing that makes this more appealing than the Sopranos for me is rather than the anti-hero, Tony Soprano, Deadwood has a Hero figure(The Sherrif). I never really liked or identified with Tony or any of the characters for that matter.  Watching the Sopranos was like watching a train wreck in slow motion, hard to turn away.  Deadwood is a little bit like that too but, I don't find myself wishing everyone dead in the crash.  While this story takes place in Colorado, I am a California native and resident of Sacramento.  I imagine, the California gold country was allot like this back in the days of the 49ers.  The production quality is fantastic and the acting/ directing is for the most part wonderful.

It's nice to know this depth of creative integrity and intelligence still exists. The photography transports you to another time and place; and I would kiss the casting director right on the lips. He or she is BRILLIANT.This series presents characters so richly developed we can predict how they MIGHT react in any given situation. ""Sweringen"" is a guilty pleasure. When first introduced, I thought ""I can never get into this series, the male character is pure ee-vill."" But he gradually won me over.Bill (RIP), Jane, Charlie Udder, Wu ... we see that the rough exteriors conceal fragile innards and we care what happens to them. (I think Udder is my favorite character; the uncomfortable dynamic between Charlie and Jane is a hoot.)Seeing what troubled folks of that time reminds us that we haven't come that far baby. Key human issues remain. I guess that's why I find it strangely comforting and totally addictive.About profanity. I know if I walk into a donut shop I'm going to see crullers. If I go to the dentist's office I'm gonna hear drilling. I know if I turn on Deadwood I'm going to hear cursing that would make a biker blush. And you know what? I LIKE it! If you don't, don't watch.

However, if you don't mind constant cussin', then sit back and enjoy the ride. I admit that even I was a bit taken aback when the profanity started to fly. It's a bit jarring. But once you get into the flow of the show and its characters, it gets to the point where you just enjoy it for what it is. At times it can be SO over the top you just have to laugh at it (I know I did). It would be a disservice to the show to say it's simply all about a shock-value gimmick though. The characters and performances are believable and the situations that developed had a remarkable ability to paint everyone in a realistic light. There are no truly &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34; characters. While they certainly lean heavily in one direction or another, they all commit acts of brutality and tenderness. By the end of Season One (no spoliers) the final scene left me with a sense of the ensemble being one big, dysfunctional (albeit violent) family.Now onto Season two...	5.0	Outstanding Western Drama	2014-06-22	0	0	0

""movie watcher"""	"'Deadwood' replaces 'The Sopranos' as the best show on television and arguably one of the best dramatic series in the history of television.Enough has been said about the rich and poetically vulgar dialogue that I don't need to repeat it here.  Suffice it to say that Milch has scripted one of the most surprisingly original screenplays in a genre that may have been exploited to exhaustion.  'Deadwood' defies, spits in the face of, every western cliche', only to conclude brilliantly, with the consummate cliche' of the old west - the new sherrif in town. Sheer genius.The acting is top-notch and an event unto itself.  Most films or television series are lucky to have one or two dominant actors to carry the rest of the cast through.  In 'Deadwood', in addition to the leads, which are cast perfectly in Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant, each supporting role is cast and performed brilliantly.  From Keith Carradine as the legendary Wild Bill Hickok to, my personal favorite, Brad Dourif as Doc Cochran.The characters and stories touch every nerve possible.  The crude violence can make you flinch or even turn away, then the perfectly placed humor can make you laugh out loud (the appointment of E.B. Farnum as the ad-hoc ""mayor"" of Deadwood is one of the most hyterical moments I've ever witnessed on a screen).  Al Swearingen, played unforgettably by McShane, is the richest, most complex bad guy since Tony Soprano.This is a must see for anyone, particularly for the faithful of the western genre."	5.0	The Best Show On Television	2006-04-17	9	6	3

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1VQ7224NAYPQH	"M. K. Bessey ""Reading Rocks!"""	When it first aired, Deadwood was seedy and gritty and peppered with words I was never allowed to say in Catholic school or any other school for that matter, but it was so compelling,  Like a train wreck, I couldn't help but watch it.  It quickly became my favorite series of all time.  Not afraid to push any envelope, the story that unfolded was sometimes hard to watch due to its explicit nature, beheadings and the like, but painted a picture of the Westward expansion, the likes we may never see again.Robin Weigert does a bang up job as Miss Jane Canary, referred to in one episode as &#34;that half woman, hangs around Hickcock&#34;.  Superbly cast, it ticks all the boxes for suspense and drama. It seemed a wonderful piece of Americana when it first aired and has held up some ten years later.  My only beef with it was that we never got the ending we were promised and while most of the stories wrapped up quite nicely after season 3, I felt cheated that the characters that I so came to love never really got any closure.

I knew before I even read them that any rating below three stars would be someone decrying the use of ""filthy"" language.  Do you honestly believe that people didn't talk and behave that way in the old west?  In literary sources about the real Al Swearengen's Gem Theater, where women were forced to ""perform unspeakable acts"", the men who handled the women were referred to as ""box-wranglers"".  This is not a quote from the TV show folks, it's a historical fact.  With phrases like that being thrown around, don't you think their language was probably peppered with profanity?

I enjoyed the first three seasons of the Sopranos and then I quickly lost interest (once they put Tony's family over the mob). Then I started watching Carnivale in 2003 and remain hooked to this day. I love the western genre, so I gave Deadwood a try when it premiered last March I believe. From the first episode I was hooked and have been ever since. The acting is some of the strongest to ever be seen on a television show of any kind. Of course the great Ian McShane as Al Swearengen leads the way (I was so glad he got that Golden Globe), followed strongly by Keith Carradine as Wild Bill, Timothy Olyphant, Powers Boothe, and Brad Dourif just to name some of the great performances found on this show. Deadwood and Carnivale have given me a reason to watch TV again. It's nice to see that HBO hasn't fallen into all the reality show craze (which is starting to slowly die away) and produces shows worth staying up late on nights that we should be going to bed early before work. As long as shows like Deadwood stay on, I will go work my early shift on Monday...tired and satisfied.	5.0	"The Best Character on TV Right Now is Al ""Swear-Engine"""	2005-02-12	19	18	1

I read comments about the ""colourful"" language used throughout the first season but was in no way prepared for what I heard. It's a real shame that, given the quality of the acting, the detail in the sets and costume design and cinematography overall, the script writers were not able to impress me with their lack of command of the English language. There were many extremely well written lines throughout the series. However, these were overshadowed by the use of f*** and c********* and c*** throughout the series. With some of the lines, every second word in the sentence was the f*** word. HBO should have a competition to see who can count the number of times the f*** word was used. The reason I rated it a 4 is because I tried to ignore the use of this foul language and some of the vulgar scenes. Sadly, if all that foul language was beeped out, there wouldn't have been much of a script for Ian McShane. I hope Season 2 makes better use of the English language."	4.0	Great series but shame about the languauge...	2005-02-26	43	9	34

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1MOGEXNCBZE3U	"M. Packham ""Stuart"""	Sitting through these twelve masterful episodes of television I couldn't help but think I should savour every minute. Deadwood ranks on even keel with the best of the HBO drama series, namely The Wire, The Sopranos and the first two seasons of Six Feet Under. It moves perhaps a bit more slowly than the aforementioned and is sparing in its shocking and riveting moments, but nevertheless maintains the viewer's attention from start to finish with some finely drawn characters and excellent plot points.Central to the show is Seth Bullock, the stern-faced ex-sheriff of Montana who comes to Deadwood, a law-free town not yet annexed to the United States, to start a hardware business with his Jewish partner Saul Starr. Upon arrival he immediately meets the ruthless, foul-mouthed Al Swearengen; the drunken, depressive Wild Bill Hicock; and the blustering, all-bark-and-no-bite Calamity Jane, to name but a few.The 'camp' of Deadwood runs on subsistence trade, gambling, prostitution, prospecting and drinking. Thus, for the entirety of the season we are kept within its mud-soaked streets and rickety wooden saloons. The people of Deadwood are many and varied, coming from miles around to find their fortunes in the hills or to start a business from scratch, or perhaps to claim property that will later be annexed and recognised by the United States as bona fide title.In this glorious context the story of Deadwood begins, and it would spoil the surprises of the show to reveal the multiple plot threads. Suffice to say that electrifying every scene that he's in is Swearengen, played by Ian McShane. His Swearengen is aptly put by a reviewer on this page as the Tony Soprano of the wild west. He's not all bad, but he's certainly no good. Also, ejecting from his mouth is a constant stream of profanity and put-downs to both his friends and enemies. McShane deserves every award in the book for his work. Timothy Olyphant plays Seth Bullock with a sense of implosive violence. Bullock forever just seems to be keeping his anger in check, and Olyphant plays the role with enough skill for us to see, at once, that he's kind hearted yet brimming with self-loathing.Like Carnivale, this show moves slowly. This is a superior show though - one that offers more bounty to the viewer. The most interesting character in Carnivale was Brother Justin, who, to the show's detriment, suffered from a lack of airtime. In Deadwood though, we see plenty of the best character, Al Swearengen. He dominates the show, and without him, or perhaps even without McShane playing him, it wouldn't be half the show it is.	5.0	A brilliantly written character piece	2005-08-13	10	9	1

A good plot is just not so explicit.  I don't want to watch the details of coitus and so much flesh.  This drama is good in other respects but again a little over-the-top in violence.  Maybe I'm just old fashioned and like to build the story in my mind.  I remember when my nephew and I would lay on the floor and listen to the Lone Ranger on the radio.  It was before television and we, with our chins propped up on our hands, would listen intently and imagine in our minds what was happening on the radio.  By the way, it was my half-nephew who was just 9 months older the I was and we used to live in the same household in San Diego at the time with my older half-sister.	2.0	Deadwood1	2014-06-05	1	0	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AT0E6UBVJMJ6W	Ms Winston	"This DVD of the first season of ""Deadwood"" is worth every cent. For those of us who are fanatical viewers, the bonus disc is outstanding, and greatly enhances the enjoyment of the series. For those who are new to the program, I would suggest viewing the bonus disc first, to get a feel for the series prior to watching the first episode. There is nothing in the nature of a real spoiler on the disc, and I was very impressed with the features, especially the one on the history of Deadwood, the town. It includes photographs of the real people who were the inspiration for many of the characters in the series, and interviews with the actors who portray them.The plot of the series has been related elsewhere on this page, so I will not give a rundown of the storylines, except to say that they are skillfully entertwined. The relationships between the characters are complex, particularly the relationship between Al Swearengen and the prostitute Trixie, and the parallel relationship between rival saloon owner Cy Tolliver and his madame, Joanie. Al is more openly physically and emotionally abusive to Trixie than Tolliver is to Joanie (his abuse is more psychological). Be advised that this series is not for young children, as they may find many of the images disturbing, especially the violence and strong sexual themes. One small spoiler: The women introduced in the first season seem to have had a history of sexual abuse, starting as young girls, which is not spelled out directly, but is hinted at in the course of the episodes. Also, the language used is not for ""gentle viewers,"" who may be upset by the constant use of a certain phrase, but the shock value is over (or at least it was for me) by the second episode. There is also a very good feature about the language on the bonus disc.The sets, the music, and the writing are fantastic and the acting is outstanding. I was so happy that Ian McShane received a Golden Globe for his performance as Al, after the series was shamefully ignored at the Emmy Awards. Powers Booth, often overlooked when the awards are handed out, is equally good as Tolliver, while Keith Carradine puts in a memorable performance as Wild Bill Hickok. Robin Weigert, who is a new performer for me, does a wonderful turn as Calamity Jane, who is profane when drunk, but tender and caring when sober.The second season started on March 6th, and hold the promise of being every bit as good as the first season, with some new plot twists and turns.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1W6AP65VGFWUH	"MT Palms ""EmGee"""	I loved this series when it first ran, and was disappointed when HBO ended it. If getting so many of the HBO series is part of the reason my Prime subscription is going up next renewal, it is $20 well spent.I only wish Amazon would stop penalizing people with slower internet connections. The best I can get is 2.5 mbps (according to statistics, 40% of America is stuck with 'slow speed' broadband of less than 5 mbps). A one hour episode often takes 2 hours to watch because 5 minutes of program takes 5+ minutes to buffer, and unlike youtube for instance, which will load an entire movie, Amazon video won't let more than a few minutes load, then half the time it is so pixelated, it is hard to watch. It is incredibly frustrating to pay as much for lousy service as someone else pays for HD.All they have to do is let us choose our connection speed, and if we choose the lowest, let the whole video load (clue: it would take hours, so who would do that if they didn't have too?). I am venting here because there is no where else to do it. If enough people do, maybe Amazon will finally listen.	5.0	Glad to have a chance to watch this again.	2014-06-05	0	0	0

The plot gets less compelling the further into the season you get, to the point that there really isn't any reason to continue watching the show. The single most off-putting thing about this show, though, has to be the dialogue. Does the writer really believe that people used more profanity 120 years ago than they do today? Certainly he can't be that daft. He's got to be throwing all of the F-bombs in there because he mistakenly thinks that it makes the show more appealing. On the contrary, it completely pollutes and ruins the show. I just got so sick of it that I stopped watching the series a third of the way through the season. With better writing this show could have been something good, but as it stands, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	1.0	F-bombs by the truckload completely ruin and invalidate this Western...	2014-06-12	5	2	3
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Created by NYPD Blue writer David Milch, HBO's Deadwood isn't just the best show (along with the even more brilliant the Wire) to hit HBO in some time, it's the best thing to happen to the western genre in years.  Taking place in 1876 in the lawless town of Deadwood, former lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant, perfectly cast) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes) arrive in town to make a fresh start and, like almost everyone else in town, to make some lucrative business as well.  In the center of Deadwood is Al Swearengen (Golden Globe winner Ian McShane); a foul mouthed, blood soaked tyrant and saloon owner who quickly becomes one of the most mesmerizing, magnetic, and unforgettable villains in TV history.  Paths are also crossed with burned out outlaw Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his cohort Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), and that's only the beginning.  There's so much more going on in these 12 episodes that the complexity of it all will amaze you, and the star making turn of Olyphant and especially McShane will leave your jaw on the floor.  Also featuring Molly Parker, Powers Boothe, Paula Malcomson, and Brad Dourif; Deadwood features the most well assembled ensemble cast since Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana's Oz.  There can't be enough said praise for Deadwood, you have to see it for yourself, and once you enter, you won't want to leave.	5.0	Brilliant, the best show on HBO today	2005-02-19	15	14	1

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AH3H4FUPZF2T4	Nice Marmet	"Controversy surrounding this series invariably focuses on the supplementation of brutal obscenity to the lavish Victorian-era linguistic style.  Those who argue this, supposedly on the side of morality, invariably omit the fact that, in the pilot episode of this series, eight people, both male and female, meet their demise at the hands of other human beings.  The language is the problem?  To quote Mr. Swearengen: ""I'm a purveyor of spirits, dope included, and when chance affords, a thief, but I ain't no f-g hypocrite.""The inclusion of modern slang, if that is indeed all it is (I cannot for one pass judgement... I find all sources on this subject inherently biased), is fundamental to the thematic resonance of this series.  How far removed is our society from this barbaric world when our primary objections lie entirely within excessive use of (realistically harmless) four-letter words?  Words hurt feelings.  Murder, I feel, is somewhat worse.David Milch has given us a show with insight into the true nature of humankind... and I would expect no less from a former professor of English literature at Yale University (yep, look it up).  If brilliant contemporary storytelling necessitates insignificant historical inaccuracy, well... then so the f-k be it.This is the best show on TV today, and among the best of all time.  This is storytelling that lends credit to the idea that we  are, indeed, every bit as intelligent and thoughtful as we are idiotic and scornful.History is a lie agreed upon.  5 f-g stars."	5.0	The likes of a mind as of Milch...	2005-03-11	19	16	3

Regardless, the language is not the most important aspect of the show--though it is the most obvious.  The characters--and their motives--seem so relatable, if you have some imagination.  Greed, Power, Sex, Racism...no! I'm not talking about the late 20th century and early 21st, I mean DEADWOOD.  Include also love, deceit and cowardice!  And more more, Im sure.  The truth is this:  This show is vulgur.  It is offensive, possibly.  But it is also entertaining and realistric.

Deadwood is anything but typical. The dialogue is clever and rich. The acting,in particular Ian McShane's Al is remarkable for a tv series . There are more great performances on a weekly basis than I could list. There is violence and filthy language,all serving the realistic feel of this fictional story of a non-fictional town.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	"Hard on the heels of the cinematic, mysticalCarnivale, HBO pull out a gritty, puke-, blood, cuss- and mud-soaked western, tracing in quasi-historical fashion some of the days of Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Seth Bullock and others in a pre-confederated gold prospecting camp called Deadwood, in what is nowadays Dakota. Despite their manifold differences there is a commonness of sepia tone, and both plumb equally cavernous philosophical depths: Intellectually, Deadwood is a meditation on anarchy in which Hobbesian pessimism is tested but falsified: in Deadwood, decent men (and strong women) prevail despite the poor odds - as long as you are prepared to be openminded about exactly what might count for decentness, at any rate.The first episode takes a while to catch fire - the brutalilty and nastiness is heaped on, and the narrative is spent establishing the hard-man credentials of most of the cast, and the dope-addled naivete of Alma Garrett and her patsy-written-all-over-him husband, fresh from New York to seek their fortune in the hills with the rest of the lowlife.But soon some things become clear. Primarily among them, Ian McShane - once BBC's loveable rogue antique dealer Lovejoy (I kid you not) has a peach of a part as the dastardly, but all the same loveable, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen, and he utterly nails it. A swear engine he certainly is - although matched in his cussatorial enthusiasm by the entire rest of the cast, McShane bullies, and cajoles, and wisecracks his way through the series with the experienced occular twinkle of a life-long loveable rogue, every appearance on the screen an utter joy to behold.McShane is perfectly cast - but is aided and abetted by a terrific supporting cast and a sublime script. Sublime, that is, if you don't mind the dictionary definition of ""a stupid or unpleasant person"" sprayed around. If repeated reference to ladies' nether regions, rendered agriculturally, isn't your bag, then nor is this show, by the way. But the blue language is matched by the inventively archaic dialogue which is simply wondrous, particularly in McShane's capable hands. One tip: the dialogue is rendered quickly at times and, as a single word is not to be missed, I found it useful to have the subtitles permanently on!Elsewhere the characterisation is beautifully played, with a succession of great double acts: Robin Seigert's Jane to Dayton Callie's Charlie Utter; William Sanderson's EB Farnum to Molly Parker's Alma Garrett, but mostly the fulcrum around which all relationships, dramatic impulse and sypathy revolves is the marvellous Al Swearengen.The production values are top notch, and if there were a weakness, it would be Timothy Olyphant's somewhat effete Seth Bullock: attempting the strong silent treatment, but not really pulling it off: A hard job, in any case, when everyone's rooting for Al.Olly Buxton"	5.0	A slow-burning riot - take a bow Ian McShane	2007-08-28	7	4	3

It didn't. It has more focus on dialogue, but most of it is inconsequential. Like Carnivale, Deadwood relies on your commitment to absorbing the atmosphere of the show to maintain your interest. It's not going to win you over with it's plot, dialogue, or characters if you aren't already dedicated to liking the show on concept alone. Obviously I haven't lived in the 1800s but I don't find the way the characters talk very believable. It's like a Shakesperian take on 1800s America. There's a sense of urgency in almost every line delivered by any character. No one is ever relaxed. These are supposedly relatively uneducated people, but even when they're living up to their crude, brutish expectations, they conduct themselves with a sense of Shakesperian dignity that I don't know how to take. I guess the intended audience for this show is people who like ""classic"" novels like To Kill A Mockingbird and Of Mice And Men, and that's not me."	2.0	Please enter a title for your review	2005-08-24	49	9	40

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1TVP6C06M6ZKX	"Paul Papadopoulos ""Kinky Greek"""	"My son bought me the box set of season 1 for this past  Christmas in Ontario. As a fan of Lost and 24 Hours I was a bit sceptical because I never really liked Westerns. I actually fell asleep during the first  episode but this may have been due to  over indulgence in a Kosher Turkey on Boxing Day (the first fresh non-Kosher turkey rotted in the driveway on Christmas eve before the women of the household  remembered they had left it there). However, on returning home to Greece I doggedly watched the episode  that I had missed and realised that this brilliant series is about  strong  personalities and  micro power struggles in the  real Wild West of America before law and order have been established and is entirely different from the usual  western.  An order of sorts is  maintained via conventions by the chief town villains themselves, two rival  hotel,  bar and brothel  owners. Al Swearengen (a true historical character)  owner of the Gem Hotel played by the British arch villain  actor Ian McShane (remember his role as the villain  bank robbery promoter in Sexy Beast)  and  Cy Toliver played by Powers Boothe (whom I last remember  as the father of the lost boy in the Emerald Jungle and as the 1940s detective Philip Marlowe in the television series aired in the 1980s).  As in the case of the main villain  real historical events and people  have been fictionalised. So we  meet  characters such as Wild Bill Hickok  and Calamity Jane.  True to  history  Wild Bill is murdered while playing  cards in the Gem Hotel bar.The good guys, who open a hardware store together, are  Seth Bullock (played by Timothy Olyphant) and his  Jewish partner, Sol Star  (played by John Hawkes, the  liquor store  manage who comes to a sticky end in From Dusk to Dawn) are also based  on true Deadwood characters. The script is lively and fascinating as are the  multiple plot developments. By the end of episode two  one  begins to  disentangle the different elements in Deadwood.The cinematography is superb with just the right amount  of light, shadow and  dark ""whiskey"" tones to give a sense of the late 1870s period and its hurricane  lamp lighting (one can  almost smell the oil burning). The musical score is also excellent, while the casting  could not be better.  A wealth of good actors without  exception.  Aside from some steamy sex scenes there is a good deal of violence, with many of the victim's bodies donated to the Chinese  laundry man's pigs as fodder. One  wonders what spice such high protein  feed  gave to the  taste of local bacon, hams and pork ribs? The language is obscene to the extreme. The f-word is often used as a form of punctuation. I cannot  stop wondering whether  blasphemy would have not been  more common and damning than sexual references in late nineteenth century  swearing  (as it is still the case in modern Quebec). The swearing, sex  and violence is  mostly incidental but necessary for the right  atmosphere.Even The arch villain  Al Swearengen, evil as he is  portrayed,  is shown to have a human side, albeit a twisted  humanity of sorts. He generally murders or has people murdered that get in his way or annoy him, but  one  ""kind"" act by his perverse standards is when he smothers a dying preacher to  put him out of his agony (also to get rid of the noise the poor demented  cleric is making while  on his last legs). McShane's villain is indeed a complex  person but not without a sense of warped humour. The rival as portrayed  by Powers Boone is smooth, cool and wicked (though  more sparing than  Swearengen  in his  choice of the moment to murder a young couple who have robbed him as an example) without  even the slightest touch of  humour. Calamity Jane (admirably played by Robin Weigert)  provides the full range of humour needed as a comic relief to the grimness and severity  of the series  and is true to the historical character, being drunk most of the time  but  extremely fond of children.The real  hero of the series one, in my opinion is Doc Cochran  who administers to the medical needs of the whole town, including  treating a small pox epidemic as well as  carrying out the regular inspections of the town  prostitutes state of health and  providing vials of opium to a female drug addict. His fine unselfish humanity  in this hellish den of  iniquity - that Deadwood was - is revealed when he  produces  an effective prosthetic  device for the  unfortunate cripple who chars at the Gem Hotel and  accepts her request to  waltz with him once the device has been  fitted and she can move normally. The actor who plays the part of Doc  with the unlikely name of Brad Dourif, may be remembered from  his role as Grima Wormtongue in  the Lord of the Rings trilogy."	5.0	Deadwood not Dead in the Water	2007-02-02	7	5	2

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3UQK2MWHR4CAH	pbenvin	"Easily the best and most realistic Old West-based television show to come along, well, ever. For those that have denounced this program as ""trashy"" and ""unrealistic,"" you clearly have no understanding of how this country was formed. The vast majority of these people were outlaws, drifters, hustlers, and thieves. Even the so called ""good guys"" were dirty rotten scoundrels when it was to their benefit. If you're going to call something ""unrealistic,"" for God's sake, you only have to look to any John Wayne western. Sorry folks, this is how it was back in those days.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3D7MDWYNH1SPA	P. B. Terry	Be well aware that this show will provide some verbal assault of your sensibilities. You will hear the f-word, the n-word, the c-word, and many variations you may never have considered (you will hear these words frequently and in abundance). So that is the WARNING. That said, this is a gritty show with a cast of rough characters with both questionable and unwavering attributes. It has a strong story for all three seasons. About 1/4 the way through season 2 the show seems to take a Shakespearian turn in the dialog and rhythm of speech. All of a sudden characters get very &#34;smart&#34; and it is very much like watching a Shakespeare play (which is sort of cool as the setting is very much the northwest territory and the story is about gold and political jockeying for annexation by either Montana, Dakota, or Wyoming. Lace that up with iambic pentameter, and it makes for a decently compelling show that despite its raw use of language, unabashed violence, and period accurate abuse of women and minorities, finds an audience wanting to see how the story ends...	4.0	Shakespeare in the Dakota Territory?	2014-06-18	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3I2BCQKBGGYFY	pd	I rate this somewhere between three and four stars. I'm not prude but massive overuse of the F bomb and CS bomb is distracting and gratuitous. I guess the writers weren't inventive enough to portray the rough and tumble West any better. Tim Oliphant is great as he is in Justified which, by the way, is a strong &#34;five star&#34; and does it without superfluous and inane obscenities. Talented writing.  I sure would have rated this five except for this serious shortcoming. It REALLY takes away from the story.	3.0	Could have been a five.	2014-06-01	4	2	2

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AEU6FBLQ6U4JR	Peggy H Wagmer	I purchased Deadwood because Timothy Olyphant was in it, and had really liked his FX hit &#34;Justified.&#34;The storyline in &#34;Deadwood&#34; is good and pretty intriguing,  but the language is extremely profane and detracts from the episoides.  I feel like I am watching some of the new reality shows on TV, where they have to bleep every fourth word out, except in Deadwood, nothing gets bleeped, and makes the viewer grimace. My grandparents and my husband's grandparents were all born in the 1800's.  And profanity just wasn't as prevalent back then.  &#34;Deadwood's&#34;  depiction of Calamity Jane is way off-based.  If a writer is going to incorporate real people into the show, then do a little research and then don't make them so unappealing to watch.My family has always enjoyed westerns and don't mind if they are gritty.  But, unfortunately, the writers lost the true essence of the Wild West, and just interjected profanity when they couldn't come up with the right words.  We will finish the 1st season, but won't buy the next.	3.0	Deadwood in the Old West, written like the language of the 21st Century	2012-12-28	2	1	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2AO4Q67XYJIEX	Pendeplume	I started to watch this based on Olyphant's portrail of Raylin Givens in Justified. Unfortunatley I didn't get that far. I found most of what I saw too---what's the word for it---disgusting which may seem strange given the grit of Justified. However, Justified is much better written and staged which probably explains why Jusitifed has lasted longer than Deadwood which I found to be just that!!	2.0	ehhhh....	2014-06-10	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2367D7W1NUV0V	Peter Craine	When Deadwood first aired on HBO, I avoided it because of the language, and because of what seemed to me to be its general bleakness. I think this initial reaction is understandable. There is certainly no other show on television that has ever sounded like this.But this year, my wife gave me the first season DVD set as a sort of shot-in-the-dark birthday gift, so I gave the series a chance, and boy, am I glad I did. The show requires you to listen past the profanity, to make an effort to understand why these people speak the way they do. The dialogue is well written, lyrical, and incredibly dense; I find myself frequently backing up to rewatch scenes where I know *something* has been explained, but I'm not quite sure what. I enjoy the sensation that the people in a show are smarter than I am, that I actually have to pay attention and do some work to follow the plot and to get to know the characters. Goodness knows there is enough on television that requires little or nothing of its viewers.I think it's curious so many reviewers fixate on the language, but make no mention of the show's matter-of-fact violence, particularly the violence against women, which I find difficult to watch (even if, no doubt, historically accurate).I strongly urge those who initially rejected Deadwood because of its profanity, as I did, to give it another, longer, more thoughtful chance. This show rewards its most attentive viewers. I'm looking forward to purchasing seasons two and three.	5.0	Don't allow fear of profanity to keep you from this well written show	2010-09-20	1	1	0

This is not the stuff taught to us in the school text books. Rather Deadwood shines a light on the evolution of the American dream of having the freedom to pursue your own goals and interests. The show is well done with some very interesting characters and story lines. The language is crass but I am accepting it as typical for the day of the frontiersman and his or her lack of schooling. This program is interesting to supplement your understanding of where we have come from and where we are at today as a country.  1876 to 2014 not much has changed in the human character.	5.0	Nice way to view our history	2014-01-09	0	0	0

I lived in the Black Hills soon after the second ""Wounded Knee Incident"", and the open and encouraged racism, power struggles, hushed up murder, drunken obliteration, drug use, and despair were peppered with the will to survive by doing whatever it took.  Some individuals were able to transcend the chaos and keep their integrity more or less intact.  The wise and the lucky, the tenacious and the deviously clever all existed within the darkness and the light of Deadwood, Lead, Rapid City.  Watching this series made me aware of just how deadly life has been through the decades in this area, where that struggle for domination originated.""Deadwood"" shows humanity lost, adrift, dormant, transcendent.  Ian MacShane is absolutely riveting, the decay and decadence is absolutely believeable, the unrelenting profanity and brutality are exhausting.  Liberties are taken, but the acting, writing, costumes, sets, are ravishing in their touch of truth.  Not to be missed, not for the faint of heart or romantic.

In just a short time I found myself embracing ever character, even the ones I despised, drawing me into the happenings and the politics of what is Deadwood.	5.0	Deadwood - The Complete First Season	2007-07-12	2	2	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A25TSE46NDFD6N	Ray S.	There are people who immediately disparage some forms of art, regardless of actual artistic value or purpose, merely because they find it to be offensive to their sensibilities. Such is often the case with Deadwood.Before saying anything about the series, I urge you to quickly browse the rest of the reviews here on Amazon. First, notice how the vast majority are 5-star reviews, praising the series for its brilliant writing, outstanding acting and thoroughly convincing period style. Next, notice how the occasional 1-star reviews (which tragically rob this series of the 5-star rating it deserves) are because of one thing: foul language. If you find yourself unable to embrace this incredibly well-scripted and well-cast series because you find yourself offended by ubiquitous use of the F-word - then don't even bother to watch.It is rated TV-MA: for mature audiences only. The meaning of the term mature could not be more appropriate here. Deadwood is the sort of series that only comes along once in a long while. I don't need to reiterate what countless others have said.Bottom line: if you can understand that the vulgarity was precisely intended to recreate the shock value of someone visiting Deadwood in the late 19th century, then you will be able to appreciate this incredible TV drama. Otherwise, don't waste your time and DON'T post an undeserved 1-star review.	5.0	One of the best period dramas in television history.	2013-06-03	1	1	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2VTT5KMJVX7LS	"R. Bacon ""Bob Bacon"""	With the 2nd season just beginning, the first season in a box is worth every cent.  This is a different western, riddled with outstanding writing and excellent acting.  Very close to the real accounts of the burgeoning South Dakota hills town of Deadwood, this series is very addictive.  The second season's first episode kicks it up another notch with a boxed set certainly in the future.

This is unquestionably the best dramatic western series ever done for television!  Imaginative and captivating while keeping historical perspective, it never ceased to keep you eagerly anticipating more of the same.  Unfortunately, just when it seemed there would be much more to come, the brain-donors in charge of programming at HBO decided to cancel this immensely popular, award winning, hit series (in the same delicate fashion as Carnivale).  It will be sorely missed. Nuts! to HBO.	5.0	The Best Dramatic Western Series Ever	2008-07-16	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A39FO99Z1V6MYV	"R. Cartwright ""rkc80"""	I remember watching the very first episode of Deadwood on the night it premiered by casual accident and I remember the very first scene in which the main character, Seth Bullock, is hanging a man.From that beginning scene I was just simply hooked onto this show. Despite the excessive profanity every episode just cease to amaze me more and more. Everything from the writing, direcing, scenery, dialogue,script, and acting is so top notched. David Milch is a true genius for making such a tremendous show.Tim Olyphant is great portraying Seth Bullock, as well as Powers Boothe as Cy Tolliver. Brad Dourif should also be given credit for the pinnacle-of-his career performance as the Doc, and to William Sanderson who may have finally broke from his Newhart-stereotyped image.The beautiful Molly Parker should also be reconized for her harrowing performing as Alma Garrett. But it is Ian McShane who's role as Al Swearengen is so outstanding and convincing that you would have to rate him among one of the greatest characters in TV to date. McShane was well deserved for that Emmy. I won't forget the other members of the great cast like Keith Carradine, Robin Weigert, John Hawkes, Paula Malcomson, and Dayton Callie.I'am so much agony just waiting for Season 2, but in the meantime I'am glad with the 1st season on DVD. If you haven't seen this show yet then go see it. I would wager my whole month's paycheck that you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Probably the BEST show ever in the history of television!	2005-03-02	15	12	3

I must admit that the language used is not only rough but also an anachronism. The curse words used here were not those used in the old west.  One was more likely to see words we consider very  mild today but that came from the bible and in those days blasphemy was considered the highest of wrongs.All in all the acting and the character development makes this a well developed cast and a series of accuracy, filled with complex characters and if you want to see good acting, good drama and just plain good theater, this is worth your time.	4.0	Excellent acting but the language is bizarre	2009-05-28	2	1	1

Hickock was shot during a rather robust day in 1876 in Deadwood not amongst a few poker players as in this series. Calamity Jane needs a haircut - see pictures of her. Unimpressive and will probably get more awards. Scary! Just give me history. Why is the truth so hard to depict?I thought Hollywood had the greatest talent pool in the U.S. if not the world.

HBO is a bargain with the amount of innovative series TV they put on, and Deadwood is no exception.First, like many HBO series, be forewarned-this is programing for ADULTS. If you can't get past a)LOT'S of four letter words, b)lots of sex, and c)lot's of violence (all of which, IMO, are ACTUALLY intergral to the storylines in this case), then you should probably skip it.Deadwood is something to behold-the old west, warts and all. The sets are pretty much shades are dirty brown, cause everything was dirty and brown back then. The interplay between the ""bad guys"", the semi bad guys, the law abiders and the law ignorers is fantastic. Everyone's real-they are not bad or good, they have flaws, some major ones, but redeemable qualities as well-just like the real world. The storylines are written beautifully-they'll have you crying one moment, shocked, and laughing your butt off the next. The entire cast is first rate-many ""character"" actors like Brad Douriff, Jeri Jewell, Powers Boothe, etc-all of which, FINALLY get to shine in a seriesIf for no other reason to watch, two words-Ian McShane!!! This is the performance of his career. You don't know if you should love or hate him, but he certainly makes everything about Deadwood so much more enjoyable. Watching him in action, you know that there were many more Mafiaoso godfathers before Tony Soprano and Al's one of them.5 stars and most highly recommended!"	5.0	The Wild West Sopranos...	2005-02-22	14	11	3

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AC9ZB7SIVQVGJ	Richard Berger	"Ignore those who have criticized this highly original HBO series for its free-flowing cursing and hard-edged violence. While those elements are certainly in the forefront, they are only part of the entire mosaic. People that shut off their televisions because of the frequently used ""coc**ucker"" epithet (which seems to serve as a password of sorts around Deadwood) didn't give themselves a chance to experience the moving and genuine characterizations as they developed. That's a shame, for ""Deadwood"" is as unique and special in this regard as any series that HBO has aired to date.The acting is superior. All concerned, from those in the lead roles to those ""jest passin' through,"" convey who they are in depth. While some require more than one episode to fully reveal all of the subtlities and nuances of who they are, such texturing exists right from the start.Some folks have given up on ""Deadwood"" after watching the first few episodes, claiming it was going nowhere at a slow pace. The fact is, there are a lot of characters introduced in rapid order. As such, they must become familiar and well-established in our minds before their stories can be told with anything resembling a meaningful impact. At such time, they begin to matter to us.Once we understand who they are and why they are infused with such drive to achieve their dreams and goals (regardless of what it takes and who may suffer along the way), the audience becomes hooked. We care. These people are three dimensional. They are full of the traits and contradictions that all human beings possess, from the noble to the coarse. By the time the first season concludes, we can't wait to learn more about the residents of Deadwood. Their individual stories have become both engrossing and very real to us.Focusing on the two main ""villains of the piece"", some folks have written that competing saloon/gambling house/whorehouse owners, Al Swearengen and Cy Tolliver, are virtually identical. I can only imagine that those who make such a statement have merely glanced at the surface and not dared to delve any further. In fact, the two are very different people, indeed!There's one basic (and huge) difference that becomes apparent as the series develops: Al Swearengen is a pragmatist. His seemingly coldhearted actions are all committed in the name of ""doing business."" (And in many cases, Ian McShane's performance is so beautifully layered we get the sense that he is almost as disgusted by his actions as are we, the viewing audience).Cy Tolliver, on the other hand, has strong sadistic tendencies. He frequently enjoys the pain and suffering of others. While he too can make the claim it's all a matter of necessity, Powers Boothe conveys that his character often relishes his use and abuse of power. His handling of the two ""thieving kids"" is proof positive of his preference for barbaric behavior. So, while the motivations that drive the two men may superficially resemble they also contradict, raising the very real possibility of conflict at any given time.""Deadwood"" is a one-of-a-kind series. For adults only, it's not for the squeamish. It's also not to be missed."	5.0	Not to be Missed	2005-02-08	25	23	2

Too many plot threads that went nowhere, too much ""mumblecore"" sometimes, and too relentlessly ugly and bleak.But while I wouldn't put it in the same ""OMG"" class as The Wire, BSG, or Six Feet Under, I'd still classify it as essential TV.The dialog and writing is positively Shakespearean.  Ian McShane and Tim Olyphant are phenomenal, as is most of the cast.This show demands a lot from it's viewers.  Blink and you miss a lot.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1WTWBZYUQBNHX	"R.M.T. ""Ginger Vitus"""	"Being a faithful viewer of American history-based television programs and series, I feel comfortable offering a brief evaluation of Deadwood, season 1.  Let me begin by saying that I did not watch the series during its original run and have only now seen the first complete season. Most of us can probably agree that HBO has a history of producing high-quality TV entertainment, and this series is an honorable addition to that legacy. Deadwood (season 1) isn't ""The Sopranos"", but it runs a respectable close second, begging the question...why was the plug pulled after only 3 seasons? Surely it was not limited by a lack of a rich era as its backdrop or a storyline that simply dried up. On the contrary, it would seem that the series' talented creator and writer, David Milch, could write about a stale sandwich and make it interesting.Season 1 flowed very nicely. (I'm a little embarrased to admit that I watched all 12 hrs within a 24 hr period). As is often the case in television these days, characters in this series seem over the top and hard to identify with, much less like. Although far from being a prude, I felt the extreme use of profanity was unnecessary and at times gratuitous. However, I would bet that this interpretation of life in a late 19th century mining town is more closely depicted than in anything on film previously. As a historian opined on the bonus featurette: ""there were no black or white hats in Deadwood. Only hats in varying shades of grey"".I guess the best endorsement I can give is that I ordered Season 2 as soon as I finished watching Season 1. But I'll try to make it last a little longer."	4.0	If the 1870's Dakota Territories were really like this, I'm glad I'm a California baby-boomer.	2011-03-25	2	2	0

I don't think even the Irish swear that much!	3.0	Way too much swearing!	2006-05-09	30	12	18

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This is the kind of quality that I have come to expect from HBO:  an original story line that mixes in some historical truth, absolutely superlative and multi-facetted acting for complex characters, and an atmosphere that powerfully evokes a community.  Once you get with the characters, this is completely and utterly mesmerizing, some of the best TV that has ever been done imho.There are many daringly brutal lowlife sociopathic types, such as the bar owners, but there are also good people with potential to become great leaders and caretakers.  Ok, the sleaze predominates the first season without a doubt, but most of them have some pathos (with a few exceptions) and often a good deal humor and irony to them.  The presentation of historical characters, such as Hickock and Calamity Jane, is stimulating and very fun.  I looked a number of them up to learn their bios.  But the hangers-on and minor folks, such as the doctor, the preacher, and the crippled washer woman, are also wonderfully drawn and evolving, often into something that cannot be predicted.  I think that there is real depth of theme there, however cynical it might appear to more naive viewers.The plot, if there is one to be summed up, is how a gold-rush town on the frontier grows and is in search of its soul as a functioning community.  There appear to be good guys and bad, but it is often more complex than that.  Immigrants keep arriving, witnessing the struggle for power and then becoming actors in it.  In the first year, you see Deadwood evolve from a government-less spot in the middle of Indian Territory into a candidate for statehood.  The first year also defines the central characters, with peeks into their backgrounds that make virtually all of them at least somewhat sympathetic or understandable.I will definitely watch the following seasons.  That being said, it is so raw that I will not allow my kids to see it and my wife would almost certainly not like it.  Interestingly, I got the British version of all 3 seasons together for under $35, i.e. less than a third of the price paid in the US.Recommended with enthusiasm.	5.0	A brutal delight that entirely remakes the Western	2010-06-12	4	4	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AFLTHO3MB4825	Robert J. Willert	I remember watching Clint Eastwood's brilliant 'Unforgiven'. I enjoyed the film not only for the actor's performance, but because he showed us what the old west might be really like. 'Wild Bill' (Jeff Bridges) was another realistic version of the old west. What made these two westerns worth watching were the characters and the dialogue. 'Lonesome Dove' and even portions of 'Heaven's Gate' are two others...I can go on about westerns that tried to show us the way it probably was in the mid to late 1800's. Now HBO comes up with the same idea - try to show the TV audience what it was like in the old west. Okay. I'm for that. I grew up with 'Gunsmoke' and 'Bonanza' and 'The Rifleman'. Great westerns, but not very realistic I suppose. What the producers did with 'Deadwood' was hire a lot of good character actors to play key parts. Powers Boothe, Brad Dourif, William Sanderson, Ian McShane, Keith Carradine (as Hickock). Good actors all. What's the most troubling about this western series, and I won't point my finger only at 'Deadwood' but also at a host of TV shows and movies today, is it's language. Censors cannot censor what we see on cable, so HBO knows it can get away with it. Gratuitous violence, sex, and language is the name of the game these days. Critics today have called 'Deadwood' brilliant writing. What is brilliant about it? 'High Noon' starring Gary Cooper was considered brilliant for its day. 'Unforgiven' was given the Best Picture Oscar because of its depiction of the old west. That was only 14 years ago. Now characters in 'Deadwood' are using the 'F' word in every sentence. In every scene I can anticipate that every character with lines will speak some kind of profanity. It's as if they brought the old west into some 2006 comedy club where all they do is swear. 'Deadwood' would be comical if the sets and the violence and the sex weren't so depressing to watch. There is nothing comical about 'Deadwood', but there is nothing really interesting about the show either. Even though 'Bonanza' was corny and even though Matt Dillon of 'Gunsmoke' usually always got his man, these were good, quality shows that kept our interest because of characters we enjoyed. Why couldn't the producers of 'Deadwood' create characters that we can enjoy and still show us the realism of the wild west? A little swearing doesn't bother me. But when the swearing seems out of place, and the profanity here isn't only relegated to the 'F' word (they use every #@*#@!!! in the book) it becomes ridiculous. I have read many of the '5 star' reviews. I am not knocking the whole show. It has its moments. But putting a good western together means developing good characters and strong dialogue (they always go hand in hand). Can you imagine Abraham Lincoln giving a speech and including the 'F' word in it a number of times? What if the writers of this show showed how Custer died at the Little Big Horn and some of his last words to the charging Indians included the 'F' word? What were Wild Bill's final words in real life? Of course it IS known Calamity Jane was not a looker (not like here or in other depictions) and WAS known for her salty language. There is no doubt that in the old west, as it is true today, people used foul language. But in 'Deadwood' the language doesn't seem to come natually to these characters. It's as if the director is telling the actors to say their lines while inserting profanity wherever the actor sees fit (improvised profanity rarely works in the show - it just sounds stupid and unreal). 'Deadwood' could've been a quality show, and they certainly had some good ideas. However, HBO decided that their emphasis on gratuitous sex and violence and profanity as the show's main selling point was all they needed for the show to be a big hit. Luckily for the viewers of HBO's quality programs, 'Deadwood' has been cancelled. A note to 'Deadwood's' producers. 'Gunsmoke lasted 18 years. 'Bonanza' lasted 14 years (and would have lasted longer had Dan Blocker lived). Though today's young writers and producers may think these shows as silly by today's standards, they were very popular with audiences. Even though as viewers we eventually outgrow some of these old TV shows, we will never outgrow quality TV and good old fashioned filmmaking.	2.0	'Deadwood' looks real enough, but do we really need that language???	2006-06-05	39	15	24

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AU3PO882GSVB	Robert Lange	I know that I'm coming to the party late, but all the hype and all the buzz about this show while it was on sort of turned me off to it. But now that the series is over and I can just sit back and binge watch the series I have to admit it's really good. What shocks me the most is the attention to vocabulary and dialogue in this show. I've often heard that the vocabulary of the south and western folks during the periods of pre and post civil war era's was leaps and bounds above our own, but this is astonishingly real and well researched. The acting is superb and the sets and attire are splendid and accurate to the times. The violence mat be gruesome and even over done at times but it is quite real and accurate to the era as well. It's also wonderful to see how many of the cast members went on to other well done shows such as Breaking Bad, Justified and Sons of Anarchy.	5.0	Lives up to the hype	2014-06-16	0	0	0

They have brought the same edge, honor, and heart to our American ancestors with all of their good and all of their filthy points as well.Good TV is hard to come by, but HBO seems to foster keen artistic expression and exceptional products in a way the networks could never dream of producing.  After all, the networks bow and scrape to the Christan right.  And, they will stifle artistic development EVERY TIME.  Deadwood proves that HBO is above that fray......

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3B6OV1D5TQNQD	Sam	I (slightly) enjoyed watching Timothy Oliphant's John Wayne impersonation -- basically the same character he currently plays in &#34;Justified&#34;.  And also, I understand &#34;Deadwood&#34;'s creator's (David Milch) use of modern profanity because he wants to project an air of &#34;darkness and evil&#34; during a time when the F-bomb was not in constant use.  He is quoted as saying that if he had used the historically accurate curses in these characters mouths, &#34;they would all have sounded like Yosemite Sam&#34;.  Be that as it may, its constant use here serves only as an aural assault against his audience, and does not add one wit to his themes.  It is an utter distraction, and always keeps us rooted HERE in 2014 rather than there in 1876.But beyond the gratuitous and constant swearing (which does reveal a lack of imagination on the writers' part), there is the adolescent obsessive-compulsive preoccupation with the genitalia of both males and females in this series which very quickly grows obnoxious.  Much thought has gone into the various and sundry ways in which graphic verbal description can be given to the male completion of the act of fornication.  Again, it adds nothing to &#34;Deadwood&#34; and only flash-forwards us into modern porno.  I hesitate to explore in my own mind any further into that of the creator here.Most of the actors turn in adequate performances, with the exception of Calamity Jane.  Robin Weigert talks like a buffoon out of the side of her mouth, as if she has just inhaled a plate of mashed potatoes.  I had no sympathy for the character, and just cringed in empathy for the performer.  Perhaps she just needed the work?  Also, the multiple plot-lines are difficult enough to follow, what with all the mixed messages and constant cussing, and then someone decided to use the same actor (without explanation in the plot) to play two different characters.  Yes, Garret Dillahunt, who portrays Buffalo Bill's killer in Season One, is the same actor used to play Hearst's geologist in Season Two.Finally, there are some tedious soliloquies which prove that some of these writers can actually put together a coherent thought or two and make it historically accurate, but they are too little and too far between.  Add that to the lack of any real action in most of the episodes, and it makes for one long slog through to get to the end, if not the point.  This thing is being presented as &#34;much nominated and award-winning&#34;, but I cannot understand for what.  Certainly not writing, acting, or producing.  The only thing &#34;real&#34; here would be the set decorations and costuming.  It is filmed with a solid feel, the boards and wood heavy and real, instead of the usual Hollywood back-lot store fronts.  That's the best that can be spoken.	2.0	The Duke is probably chuckling.....	2014-06-23	2	2	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A106EDV1FG4U5U	Sandy Martin	I first found the show somewhat disturbing in its reality. However, after a few episodes I came to realize it WAS reality. It portrayed the wild west as it was... wild. A small gold town trying to make it. The series shows some of the realities and hardships of what we can only imagine it was like living in the wild west. For example, how did they get past the language barrier when bringing in Chinese labor? From a mining camp to a town, how local government was put in place. Piss pots instead of toilets - who took care of them? Death from many different avenues, the dead not always being buried.  I'm not sure how historically correct the series is, but it made perfect sense in how it was portrayed.The characters were very well drawn and engaging. Jane, played by Robin Wiegert, was amazing! Trixie, a joy, being pulled to her profession as well as to maybe seeking an honorable future. Jewell, heartwarming and funny.  Al, you wanted to hate him but you found you loved him. I immediately found my favorites, but every character was  played superbly. The language is a bit over the top, i.e., I don't believe women in the mid-1800's used such language in the general course of the day, however the story line got you past it.All in all a wonderful story that ended before it was finished. I would love to see an HBO movie that gives us an ending.	4.0	Superb character portrayals. Engaging!	2012-09-08	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A36V282AQTIZH9	satyadharma keyes	The period-piece effects are great in costume and setting.The historicity is interesting and well laid out.The treatment (so far, I 've only seen about 5 episodes) of Native American mythopoesis is really weak from the Native side. Ok from the Occupiers side.But the dialogue seems to be written by a drunk historian who thinks scatalogical and vulgarisms in the English language are good substitutes for good acting or writing - and this is absurd. Ok, once in a while. But the shouting, overacted potty-mouth stance given to Calamity Jane, Sweringen and his crew, the uneducated, etc. is over the top! It's like whoever is writing and directing these is partially deaf, and unsure what words in English people knew in the 1800's so they throw in a 13-year-old emotionally retarded boy's tongue who is trying to be cool. Just doesn't work. Not only that, actually detracts from what could be a good story, a deep narrative, or just an insightful conversation for plot.I don't know... the potential is there. Is the historical research as to how people actually talked and spoke to each other?Relying on the overacting and over-volumed anger etc. degrades the work. Way too much time is spent on Swearingen and Jane. Should develop some Native American characters and their side of life. Too bad. Potential missed.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"One of my favorite childhood memories comes from Deadwood Gulch.  During a cross-country road trip, my family stopped here during a heavy storm and my brother and I were thrilled to have front-row seats for ""The Trial of Jack McCall,"" a vaudeville production of the trial of the murderer of Wild Bill Hickock.  Of all the things we saw that trip, my brother and I still talk about that show.So imagine my delight at seeing an entire TV series dedicated to Deadwood, that infamous frontier settlement where Wild Bill met his end.  I was even more delighted because ""Deadwood"" is an HBO production, and HBO has quite simply made the best TV series over the past decade.Even with all that hype, I was not prepared to like ""Deadwood"" as much as I did.  Created by David Milch, this is a sumptuous, profane, dirty, conflicted, sexy, and hilarious series populated by characters who get under your skin and into your hearts.  What more can one ask for?""Deadwood"" revolves around the sordid lives of a bizarre cast of characters.  The ""town"" is actually a mere ""camp"" at the outset of the story, set in the days following Custer's defeat at Little Big Horn.  Not part of any state or territory, the camp has no sanctioned law enforcement authority.  This dubious fact, coupled with the local gold rush, makes Deadwood the land of opportunity for America's thrill-seekers, fortune hunters, desperados, and adventurers.What local law there is can be found in the corrupt soul of Al Swearengen (Ian McShane).  Swearengen runs the only saloon in town and has his fingers into virtually every pie.  His saloon, the ""Gem,"" is an NC-17 version of Rick's Cafe in ""Casablanca"" - everyone goes there, but not everyone walks out.Swearengen's hold on Deadwood is threatened by two men - Seth Bullock (Tim Olyphant) and Wild Bill Hickock (Keith Carradine).  Hickock is the only man in town Swearengen fears, but Swearengen knows that Hickock is too focused on his private demons to care a whit for Swearengen's plots and schemes.  Bullock is another matter.  A former marshall from Montana, Bullock is ruthless but wants to live a quiet life, opening a hardware store.  But it is clear that Bullock and Swearengen are going to be the two leading characters in this drama . . . and they are going to butt heads.""Deadwood"" is populated by a large, rich cast of characters, too many to list here.  My personal favorite is Doc Cochran, played with exquisite rage and humanity by Brad Dourif.  But other key players include E.B. Farnum (William Sanderson), Swearengen's flunky and ultimate mayor of Deadwood, Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe), the proprietor of a rival saloon that opens up mid-season, and Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert).Deadwood is the kind of town where murderers as well as businessmen have standing agreements with the local Chinese pigkeepers to dispose of dead bodies by feeding them to the pigs.  It is also a town that is susceptible to plague, local Sioux raids, and the prospect of imminent statehood . . . which can be either a joyous boon or the destruction of paradise, depending on which character you're talking to.Just as with HBO's other period series ""Carnivale,"" look for a dirty, realistic setting for these wonderful characters.  Virtually no character represents an archetype - all have their flaws and virtues, hopes and dreams.  Here's looking forward to Season 2!"	5.0	"Evolution of Western takes strong strides forward in ""Deadwood"""	2007-10-15	2	2	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A399A90PYENG4S	"S. M.Silver ""Lobo(AW)"""	"As a former historian, I tend to cringe when Hollywood tries to portray actual events and since ""Deadwood"" takes place during my area of concentration (Civil War to present), I was very concerned. Well, I've been delighted. Certainly there's been some playing with history but the basic thrust has been accurate. I wondered if they would be willing to have such a dominant character as Wild Bill die but they did. The struggle for control of the camp's destiny is a reasonable portrayal of what took place. The main characters did exist (the real Al was an even more viscious person than in the series) and largely were of the type portrayed. And the language... What happened in the 19th Century was that publishers refused to print accurate portrayals of frontier language, a curious mix of earthy profanity and deliberate efforts to appear of a higher class (you see some of this with the large number of people who dress formally with coats, ties, and vests even when manual laborers; this is far more so than today where the reverse is true and people try to portray themselves of a lower class than they are). In any case, the literature of the 19th Century frontier is utterly free of profanity because of that censorship and, as a result, we've seldom heard an accurate portrayal of their language. Bringing this element into the series must have been a tough decision but it gives ""Deadwood"" a unique, historically accurate sound. Undoubtedly some will find this at least initially shocking and distracting but it is hardly the most important thing about the series. The complex story lines and brilliant acting, at least for me, more than off-set any disturance I might have had at first hearing their crude yet elegant language. One other point - the lovely thing about the DVD set is that you can go back and see things again and often I have found myself picking up on bits of dialogue and nuances of acting that I had overlooked the first time (or two) through."	5.0	Remarkably accurate in actions and language	2006-06-16	15	11	4

I initally thought I would not enjoy Deadwood, since a) not a huge western fan and b) not a big fan of foul language, although it doesn't shock or offend me. I couldn't have been more surprised and thrilled. I am riveted by the poetic use of language on this show. At times, I think I am listening to Shakespeare with the multi-layered conversations between E.B. Farum ( William Sanderson, brilliant) and Al Swearengen (Ian McShane, WOW). For anyone who thinks this show is slow paced, I encourage you to really listen to the dialogue. The complexity of the show is as much in the subtlety of the language as it is in the action of the characters. It takes more than one viewing to really get all that is going on in Deadwood. A great one to own and watch on those long winter nights of boring network TV.For viewers who do not appreciate complex, multi-dimensional plots and brilliant cinematography, John Wayne is a safer bet. For me, I say:""I admit it, I am a total Deadwood addict and I am not looking for a cure, other than more, more, more!"" PS can I give it 10 stars?While it is true that the Emmy's blew it on this show, at least a Golden Globe Award went to Ian McShane.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2AIC9K8JYAPWE	"SSBN 633 ""History buff"""	"After all these years thinking that Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones could never be topped in the ""Lonesome Dove"" series on TV, I was captivated after several minutes of viewing ""Deadwood"".The realism, attention to detail, acting and script just grabs you by the lapels and refuses to let go.  I was not aware nor warned of the constant profanity, and at times found it hard to stomach.  The language comes close to forcing one away at times, but you become so enmeshed into the characters that it soon fades as an issue.  The superior production quality refuses to hide the smallest detail, from the disgusting muddy streets the public walks in to the sweaty faces with soiled clothes.  When the calvary comes into town after being on campaign all summer, they certainly would not look like they just stepped out of the costume warehouse in clean spiffy uniforms.  And they don't! They ride into town ragged, tired, slooping on muddy horses and look as about to drop from exhaustion and poor nutrition.The sets appear to be very accurate after seeing original photos of main street, and it must be true that very very few ""decent"" people inhabited the town in its first 18 months of settlement.  It's certainly not an appealing place to visit, nor are the types of characters displayed the sort you might want to hang around with.  Apparently you had to be on your guard at all times from theives, shysters, hustlers and even murderers out to get what WAS yours.Since our household does not currently have HBO, we are begging our neighbor for copies of the taped Part 2 of the series to borrow until part 2 is released on DVD.  Check the series out with an open mind, (forewarned of the profanity) and just see if it dosen't enthrall you."	5.0	Tops Lonesome Dove	2005-04-14	12	10	2

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	"""Deadwood"" is essentially ""The Sopranos"" meets ""True Grit"" -- its principal crime boss, Al Swearengen (played with enormous charisma by Ian McShane) runs his criminal empire with the same zeal and frustration as that other HBO sociopath, Tony.  The dialogue has the crippled formality of ""True Grit"" (and, later, ""Lonesome Dove""), sounding both simple-minded and ornate at the same time, even though certain terms, such as the euphemism for, um, oral gratification, probably didn't exist in 1876, and the efforts to sometimes avoid obvious racist terms by substituting perhaps less offensive euphemisms borders on comical.  That's okay, as the rest of the show at least feels authentic enough that you want to believe you're watching something historical.  The first season starts out very strong, with a premiere episode that not only sets up the characters, but provides genuine tension in the conflicts.  As the season wears on, especially after the departure of a major character, the show suffers from some of the same problems as ""The Sopranos,"" in that the ongoing, by this point soap-opery conflicts have simmered too long without meaningful resolution.  The cast, including Keith Carradine, Tim Olymphant, Robin Weigert, William Sanderson, and Brad Dourif, is excellent, providing colorful characterizations without going over-the-top.  Anyone who's picked up a Time/Life book on the Old West will find a lot of the trappings familiar, and though the show is yet another in a seemingly endless line of programs about European expansion into the frontier, yet again told from the European point of view, the lengths it goes to to show the immorality of the period is refreshing.  These are not morality tales, however, but ones about power, certainly an element of Old West mythology that generally goes overlooked.  Graphic on pretty much all fronts, ""Deadwood"" also favors a particular word beginning with ""C"" . . . let's just say that there are few words I know that are more likely to offend people, especially women I know.  You've been warned.  The first half of the season rates a solid 5.  The second half brings the overall rating about to a 4."	4.0	Starts Out Strong . . . Peters Out a Bit at the End	2006-12-23	4	2	2

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1A6AODFJ81WWX	Stratos Safioleas	"Since I don't live anymore in the US I try to keep up with good TV series by buying DVD (via amazon.com).  I knew nothing about ""Deadwood"" until I read an article about censorship and TV in America today in the New York Times (that was about two months ago).  ""Deadwood"" was offered as an example of a program that would be more and more difficult to be produced despite its quality, because of a new push of a moral (moron) majority (I dare say ""majority"") to suppress whatever it's not considered appropriate for their taste.Anyway, not to get sidetracked here, I bought it out of curiosity.  Personally I don't care too much about westerns.  I mean, I like them all right, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch them on TV or in a theater.  So I was very reluctant before watching ""Deadwood"".Well, in my opinion, ""Deadwood"" may very well be the best kept secret in American TV right now (many of my American friends have not watched it on TV).  Of course it shouldn't be such a big surprise.  It's an HBO production, which is a good start, and then it's David Milch.  The man has done NYPD Blue and Hill Street Blue (among other things).This is no ordinary John Wayne-western.  It's real, it's dirty, it's not necessarily happy-ending.  But it's great.  The good guys, the bad guys, the rivalries, the friendships, the dialogues. Man, the dialogues.  When you do buy the DVDs take the time to listen to Milch's interview about the language used in this series and how they went about making sure that along the clothes and the buildings and the customs the cared enough to make sure that the language is real. On top of listening to some very interesting information you will get to understand the kind of energy and talent is involved in this.""Deadwood"" is fantastic.  It's good TV.  No, it's not just good, it's superb.  After a while you feel like you have something invested in this community of bandits who's trying to make a future back then in the ""wild-west"".  Anyway, not to get overly sentimental here you will enjoy every episode and you will be looking forward for season two.  It's worth every penny you will spend on it and more."	5.0	Superb TV - David Milch (NYPD Blue) at his best	2005-05-03	22	18	4

When you watch this show you actually feel like you are covered with mud and later the plague. The show tries to make up for the lack of action and uninteresting plotline by stretching out the scenes with surly looks and by swearing a lot. I was really looking forward to watching it because it had so many GREAT reviews. Liar, liar pants on fire. With that said Keith Carradine, Robin Weigert, Brad Dourif, William Sanderson, Ian McShane, Dayton Callie, and other cast members did and amazing job. Unfortunately Carradine and Weigert departed the show early on. Don't waste your time with Deadwood.	1.0	Deadwood is like watching dead wood.	2009-03-10	34	10	24

There is also an explanation on the final disc of season 1 during a rather lengthy interview and I have not read, but know that exists, an article Milch published in some print media justifying the show's profanity.  I'm sure you can find it with intrepid searching.  I tend to agree with Milch's arguments for the profanity.  They're too long to sum up here, imagine the entire length of this review dedicated to one thing.Language part two:  What people (and I haven't read every review, only a third of them) don't seem to understand when they say that the dialogue isn't real, is that in the late 19th century, the educated person received a Victorian education.  I have no faith that people today are going to the trouble of reading Victorian novels (and there are a lot of good reasons not to) but the language is some of the most convoluted messed up syntax in the history of modern English.  Maybe three characters of the large ensemble have been formerly educated.  This means that most of the characters are speaking a dialect half inherited from their proper victorian superiors and half filled with obscenities.  Oh, and it's mostly iambic, sometimes even blank verse if you listen closely enough.  That's one of the reasons that this is Shakespearian.Secondly, if you start to read a review that says ""I watched the first episode and then regretted buying this,"" don't listen to any of their comments except for the language.  Dozens of 1 star, 1 episode reviews claim things like ""the show is unrealistic because the characters are clean and their teeth are straight"" or ""unrealistic because their clothes are clean.""  While this is mostly true for the first episode, as the series continues (and the first half of the season takes place on consecutive days) stains and injuries stay on characters once earned, and many of the non civilized characters show the characteristics of 19th century (or modern day British) dental care as the show progresses.Other commentators note that the characters are either too good or too bad.  This is wrong because I can't think of a single character that is too good.  The show is full of Faustian types fighting to sale their souls for the highest price.  But perhaps more importantly (and more Shakespearian) is the motives that guide these characters.  The aren't Tony Sopranos, they are not sociopaths who refuse to recognize what they do is wrong, they are humans who are willing to kill in exchange for higher profits.  Even Al Swearangen, the most obvious villain, engages in occasional acts of kindness and mercy, as well as showing guilt, as tbe series progresses.  By the end of season 1, despite the brutal violence and murder, the viewer is left siding with the AMORAL (as opposed to immoral) Deadwood residents against the government residents who threaten to take away everything through legal means.And that is the principal theme of Deadwood.  Is a stable, predictable anarchy better than an extremely corruptible and equally ruthless system of law and order?Again, more at lonelyartistclub.blogspot.com"	5.0	Shakespearian	2008-07-07	4	3	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3RL4YS532HSEG	The Professor	Just got through watching this again. What a wonderful series. You have to get past the impressive but archaic language and sentence structure (accurate for that period, by the way (yes, Americans have been dramatically dumbed down). You also have to get past the earthy and the obscene used for color and effect at the time, and, unfortunately we're back in that habit again.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A8J4HJXJ00LXZ	"theworkhorse ""theworkhorse"""	"The reviewers of the HBO series ""Deadwood"" that complain that the cursing is misplaced need to read up on the history of the town.  The series seems to have too much cursing because the town had too much cursing.  Visitors to the town commented frequently on the high level of profanity and the seemingly unending presence of alcoholism, violence, sex, and other vices.  Whether you agree with those things morally is besides the point.  The series creators and writers got it right.  While the heavy use of profanity does get a bit boring after a time, the overly-flowery language of E.B. Farnum to be much more distracting.  I do wish they would kill off Farnum.  His attempts to extemporize loquaciously in mind numbing fashion make me want to watch something else.  Those who believe the profane words heard in the series were not in use in the 1870s are wrong.  The C word which so many women find offensive has a long, non-pejorative history.  It was not used in an obscene fashion until the 1600s and 1700s.  It was often used in reference to female genitalia as a commodity, i.e prostitution.  It does not seem to be used as an abusive term until the 1920s, though that finding does not seem to be based on anything concrete.  Cetainly the F word was used frequently.  I have not seen anything to disprove Wu's favorite English word that refers to oral sex was in use at the time.I have only gotten half way through the second season.  While this series is really overpriced, it is one of the best I have seen on the telly. I worry that this, like other series with great characters and superlative actors will drag on too long.  I hope they keep the series a resonable length (four to five seasons tops) and do not try to change the dynamics of a winning show too much."	5.0	Cursing in Deadwood	2006-07-12	8	7	1

It's like if the frontiersmen were walking through each scene wearing sneakers.Also the treatment of the women is historically inaccurate.  Contrary to popular belief, in those days they wouldn't have been beating up on the women the way they do here.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1VQ9PE2TU6DRG	"Tom Turwilliger ""az T"""	"Amazing how people will accept things based on a label.  The term in movies and TV ""over the top"" in reality means the writers and directors have no restraint or taste.  Deadwood initially had me devided between loving the characters, plot, setting and hating the ""over the top"" use of constant swearing.  Yup, I'll bet there was plenty of swearing back then but there was a balance of normal conversation and salty talk just like there is today.  I sat in a breakroom with a co-worker recently who went on a tirade about something or another for no more than 5 minutes.  I kept track of how many times he used the ""F word"" in those mere 5 minutes and it was 75 times. He also used the word ""dude"" about as many times but I couldn't keep track of both words.  Too much work! It would be interesting to take a work of Mark Twain and fill it with F***ing C**ks***ers to the point of absurdity.  His artful writing would be obscured with the attention drawn to childish profanity.  I use the ""F word"" on occasion when the occasion warrents but I use it for the ultimate of expression.  In other words I use it when circumstances themselves are ""over the top"".  Its a GREAT form of expression when used when something has got you completely and absolutely rilled.  Therefore, I RESERVE it for times I want to make a point when normal language doesn't suffice.  And there's the problem with Deadwood, a Mark Twain should have written the script and been allowed to pepper in some salty dialogue for occasional EMPHASIS.  Mark Twain spent some time in Silver City, Nevada and had real life experience with what the town of Deadwood was really like so too bad he's not around.  I'd sure like to have Mark Twain write the script for Deadwood but it sounds more like it was written by my co-worker.  Yo, yo, yo mother f***ing c***sucker the wild west was never so f***ing cool, dude! Could have been a great series had the writers and directors understood that the term ""over the top"" is in reality a derogotory one and the word ""restraint"" is a good one to follow."	1.0	"""Over the top"""	2009-08-12	30	6	24

Seth Bullock - the partner in a hardware shop, and reluctant yet amazing sheriff. Doc Cochran - played by Brad Douif.... this man is an exceptional, off the charts actor. .. passionate, believable, simply amazing.

The story of this outlaw-infested place, where Wild Bill Hickock, played by Keith Carradine, was brutally gunned down, is based on the real events of the town of Deadwood.  The acting, writing and direction are first-rate across the board.  Al Swearingen, played by Timothy Olyphant, is a murderous amoral brothel and tavern owner and one of the best television characters in the history of the small screen.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A23BNT7UYCWBX7	VA Duck	"This is a wonderfully well written and especially well acted series (8 Emmy awards, 1 Golden Globe) that was based on historical record. Be aware, however, that it is vulgar in language and violent in action. And yet, it is hard to imagine that the Deadwood of the Dakota Territory of the 1870s was a place of any greater decorum! Actor Tim Oliphant (currently inJustified) plays ""sheriff"" Seth Bullock with smoldering hatred and Ian McShane brilliantly plays Al Swearengen, the despicable central character with more than mere villainy - instead, downright evil. There is plenty already posted online (see Deadwood on Wikipedia) to brief you on the story line and actors for this, now defunct, HBO series (2004-2006). It is fair to say that you will either love this series or hate it: it's difficult to imagine apathy for this ""nasty-real"" rendition of the West."	5.0	Gritty West	2013-07-14	0	0	0

I have to watch it with an open mind and I still haven't decided if I should be watching it or not. I just don't like the foul language.

Besides ""The Wire"", this is easily the best show HBO has produced post-Sopranos and when that show ends its glorious reign in 2006, Deadwood will carry on the mantle for many years ahead. I devoured this entire set over the course of a few days (the last time I did that was with the Second Season of The Sopranos set). Once you get into the rhythm of the show and the pacing of the narrative, it's impossible to put down. I watched them and am now currenty caught up on the first 2 episodes of the second season and it is clear that this show is only getting better and better. There are so many different paths and stories to tell in Deadwood, I am looking foward to hopefully many more seasons. Also highly recommended is ""Carnivale"", which is very similar in certain aspects (historical, character-driven, beautifully paced) and also on HBO."	5.0	Brilliant, addictive television	2005-03-17	4	3	1

Why this guy didn't win an Emmy is one of the biggest crimes in television history. The one knock on this show is the language. Cursing is used liberally and beyond.

The acting is top notch the writing is solid the directing is first rate. In short this series is what many filmmakers and producers could learn from if they wanted to see ""HOW TO DO IT RIGHT"". It also happens to be one of the best westerns (IN MY OPINION) since purgatory. I will mention that the language is strong (NOT RECOMENDED YO THE SENSITIVE and some scenes are VERY GRAPHIC sort of like Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man in color)but it doesn't detract from the worth of the series only a warning. I highly recommend this series. I can say one thing about this series from my time on the set WALTER HILL and DAVID MILCH worked hard for historical authenticity, that plus the care and attention to detail not only on the set but in directing, acting and writing makes it a high standard in film making art and work."	5.0	Deadwood is anything BUT.	2004-11-04	23	13	10

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"This is my nominee for best new drama. This revisionist western will knock your socks off with its fascinating characters and atmosphere. It's May 1876 former Montana marshal Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his business partner Sol Star (John Hawkes) open a hardware business in the gold-mining town of Deadwood, South Dakota. Deadwood becomes the crossroads for the famous, infamous and the people they kill. Bullock meets Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and has a run in with Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane). Swearengen lives up to his name; he's a man with the foulest mouth one can imagine and a pretty nasty fellow to cross. McShane's portrayal of Swearengen makes him one of the most complex villans this side of Tony Soprano.""Deadwood"" becomes the nexus for some of the most important figures of the old west creating a great opportunity for storytelling from writer/creator/producer David Milch (""NYPD Blue""). A sprawling, down and dirty revisionist western, the pilot directed by Walter Hill (""Southern Comfort"", ""Hard Times"", ""The Warriors"") features marvelous performances from Ian McShane, Brad Dourif, Timothy Olyphant, Molly McShane, Keith Carradine and Powers Boothe. Authentic right down to the pig crap, ""Deadwood"" features the great dialogue, action and storytelling skills we've come to expect from Milch, Hill and the other collaborators on this cable TV series. A warning for viewers--you'll hear a lot of bad words because, well, because Milch feels that folks spoke like that back then.There may only be 12 episodes included here but they're all high quality. My only complaint is that the series probably could have been packaged with more episodes per disc making the set less cumbersome. The price is a bit steep for what you're getting as well but given the quality of the series, packaging and extras, makes this a worthwhile edition to pick up.Twelve episodes spread over six discs presented in a high quality anamorphic widescreen presentation, ensures that the image quality of the show is kept sharp, clear and with nice, robust rustic colors. The 5.1 sound mix actively surrounds you in the environment of the old west. Since much of this drama is dialogue based the 5.1 atmosphere comes across most effectively when there's action sequences.Although this isn't an extra per se, the designing and packaging of this series makes ""Deadwood"" special right away. One of the best packaged boxed sets I've seen, the box resembles the Star Trek: The Next Generation sets with a sturdy outer box and an accordion fold out holder for the DVDs. It's big, bulky and personally I like the package that way. Sure, it takes up a lot of space but, hey, it's better than some of the flimsy packaging we've seen lately with these expense sets. While there isn't any booklet to tell you about the show, each episode has a brief synopsis of each one. There's also a preview and recap for each and every episode included.There's a featurette on the making of the show with a generous helping of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with Milch and the cast. Featuring vintage photographs of the actual Deadwood. Milch, the cast and crew appear in the featurette as well discussing the intersection of fiction and reality in this 25 minute glimpse into the inspiration for the show.  Milch and his collaborators discuss both the attraction of the town and the mythos that it represented. Essentially a promo piece for the series it also provides a nice introduction to the series with a generous helping of clips from the show. Interviews with local historians highlight the featurette on the real Deadwood.  Keith Carradine and Milch interview each other for ""The Language of the Old West"".  There's a number of commentary tracks with Milch and most of the main cast. The quality of the commentary tracks vary quite a bit but all are informative and interesting.A terrific series well packaged (but you end up paying for the packaging) with excellent extras, ""Deadwood"" will keep you involved in the petty dealings of saloon owner Swearengen and his conflicts with the residents and prospectors of the town."	5.0	"""I don't mean to upset you, it's always about the money"""	2005-02-13	73	68	5

Oh there was abundant swearing, but not to the filthy extent this movie depicts.I also found the revisionist history frustrating.

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2KKR33NWMCQEW	William Pallister	This show is very well done across the board: writing, acting, directing, sets, costumes. It didn't grab me immediately, like HBO's Rome did, but it quickly gained my interest. Timothy Oliphant (as Seth Bullock) stands out in a great cast. Violence is unsparing but not gratuitous. An extremely violent encounter between Bullock and a Sioux warrior, for example, is more than it appears to be, in terms of both why it happened as it did, which is puzzling initially, and the interesting shading that the incident's aftermath adds to Bullock's character. Indeed, people in Deadwood are often not who they appear to be. It's an old but very satisfying dramatic technique when it's handled well, as it is in this show. A principal character departs earlier than one might have wished for--all characters here &#34;depart&#34; for the same reason--but that absence is soon forgotten in the wake of other strong story lines and performances. I'll be interested to see if the quality stays as high in the following season(s).	5.0	another great HBO show	2014-06-19	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AHPR5LH57LVAD	Wsc475	Got this on a recommendation and it didn't disappoint. Characters are well developed and plenty of sympathy for the bad guys. Excellent job re-creating the grittiness and harsh living conditions of a prospecting town. Some cynical yet possibly historically accurate shakedown of our country's development makes this series an interesting watch for all types of tv series fans.	5.0	Edgy Western	2013-08-09	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	ABWIJHSQS7W36	"wtom ""wtom"""	Good acting, good story line.  Much, too much, and unneeded profanity!  This takes away from what would otherwise be a five star rating.	3.0	Good Acting	2014-06-26	2	1	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A24FZ6XINB4VMG	Wyldhunt	While the show appears to be based upon historical facts, I found it to be too crude. The dialog is almost entirely foul language; which wouldn't normally bother me except that the words that they choose are often not correct for the period that the show is set in. I got the feeling that they tried too hard to make the characters seem crude and rude by giving them all a bunch of bad modern day slang and waving their penises around (Literally) instead of character development. The female characters all came across as weak or insane, even if they were much stronger and/or important in real life.Overall, it was a great idea that had very poor implementation.	2.0	Meh	2014-06-04	1	0	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A386NTAR8ZSLVG	"Wyluli ""Wyluli Wolf"""	"Ok, judging by the title for this review, you can guess what my main problem with Deadwood is.  I rented the first disc of Deadwood season 1 because I love the old west theme and I've liked HBO's other productions, so I really wanted to check this out.Unfortunately, within the first 5 minutes of episode 1, I quickly started noticing a theme with the dialogue that did not let up one bit throughout the 2 episodes on this disc, and that was the profanity.  Lots and LOTS of it.  I'm no goodie-two-shoes and don't have the cleanest mouth in the world, so profanity in itself doesn't bother me, but when it is SOOOOOOOO over the top that it's a distraction from what is really supposed to be going on, then that's a problem.  There were occaisions where characters in this show were able to squeeze in 2, 3 or 4 F-bombs into a SINGLE sentence.  No kidding.They could have used some profanity and gotten the point across, but it was WAY overdone.  It wasn't realistic, it was just plain stupid.It seems like people who are writing scripts for some of these movies and t.v. shows think that if they splash enough profanity around that they can call it ""authentic"".  Doesn't work, people.  There had better also be some substance, and I just didn't find it in the first two episodes of Deadwood.Even if you fixed the dialogue, I found the characters to be boring, as well as the storyline.  I really WANTED to like Deadwood, but I just didn't."	1.0	Worst F***ing Dialogue I've Ever F***ing Heard	2008-04-10	64	24	40
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2YC1TYEXEB6ZW	Yarn Whisperer	"Though the second season was not quite as thrilling as the first, ""Deadwood"" is one of the recent dramas (along with ""The Wire"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"") to convince me that television can pull itself out of the mire of formulaic, ham-fisted, dumbed-down muck that has bogged down the networks. Hopefully the third season will keep up the good work.I do wish the DVD set had more extras. I really would enjoy hearing commentary on all the episodes, and I like group commentaries because they tend to be the most interesting. Having a philosopher's commentary track on an episode or two -- as there was on ""The Matrix"" DVD set -- would have been fascinating.A note to other reviewers -- yes, there is some quite naughty language in ""Deadwood,"" but as that was the focus of many of the media reviews and articles about the show even before its debut, you can't say you weren't forewarned. I'm actually more offended by reviewers lambasting this ""abuse"" of the English language who've failed to master its fundamentals themselves. Nobody's perfect, but could you at least learn how to use punctuation? And please, know the meanings of words before you go around saying which should and should not be used. For example, though ""weak"" and ""week"" may sound the same, they do not have the same meaning.Also, HBO DVD's are really pricey. What's up with that?"	5.0	A brilliant first season, a brilliant show	2005-08-12	7	6	1
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2TN3B5TAJ6GG2	Yodausa	The first thing that hit's a person is the very STRONG LANGUAGE, that being said if you take into account the series is based on the very early start of a city in the middle of no where with a population of 98% male it make's more sense.This is the second time I am watching this series and find I missed a lot during the first viewing, it is well written the actor's are outstanding in their role's.It gives the viewers a great picture of how ruff and harsh frontier living was, and make's me wonder how the population even survived....

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A2AHH28ABFOJ8Z	Yvonne	I just finished a  Deadwood marathon. It was great. Gritty, creative, compelling storyline and more authentic than any Western series in my long history TV viewing (50s and 60s).  It was a mistake for HBO  to cancel show after only three seasons - there were more stories to tell of old Deadwood.	5.0	Marathon  (all 3 seasons) - Great viewing	2014-06-04	0	0	0
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	AB2AQMK9PCWWX	"yygsgsdrassil ""yygsgsdrassil"""	....cuz, it's the wild west unsanitized. Like the wild west probably was for real. This HBO series is like Quintin Tarrantino took an old Sam Peckinpah script and spruced it up with his absurd spitoon dialog and outrageous nastiness. This is a wild west where pigs eat dead men lying in mud, so called decent women are hooked on narcotics and everyone seems like they ain't had a bath in days. Swearengen may seem like the type of backstab snake in the grass that you may never wish to meet (do not leave him with your wife), but for this story, he is the perfect anti-cowboy. Get season one and enjoy.	5.0	I Love It...	2005-05-23	5	3	2
B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A1S1BJFTA644TU	Zalmorion the Fantastic	Believe everything you've heard about how GREAT this series is.Yes, the acting is superb.  You will witness performances that drag you to the edge of your seat in anticipation, through the dregs of depression, through humor and admiration for characters, to thrilling encounters both violent and subtly threatening.This series gives you every type of character you could ever want to watch.  Everyone is flawed.  Everyone is in danger.  Everyone is compelling.  You might find yourself rooting for the lesser of two evils quite a bit.This is how television should be done.  Perfect in almost every way.  The sets, the acting, the soundtrack--just an enthralling mix of perfection I was sad to see go.  Every episode immerses you in a time and a place that existed once, alongside characters dramatically true to their real world counterparts in many ways.  The liberties taken creatively only serve to enhance the realism and entertainment.Honestly, this series is a masterpiece cut short.  When you reach the end of the last season, you WILL feel cheated and sort of hollow.  This series had a life to live that was ruined by unfortunate circumstances.Worth buying.  Especially if you value realistic westerns with complex, dramatic story-lines.	5.0	A Perfect Western Series Cut Short	2014-06-04	0	0	0

B0006FO5LO	Deadwood: Season 1	A3NUPTHRMCJGMD	Z. Lentz	"Yes, it is. Along with the Band of Brothers series, Deadwood pretty much puts everything else on TV to shame.  The characters are so well written they are note perfect in every episode.  If you are turned off by the ""Western"" genre or the lack of stars, just know you are missing the best fiction ever created for television."	5.0	Best TV Show Ever?	2005-02-20	9	7	2
