1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	Very little to complain about in this set. I did find that the sound is a little odd in some settings,in one episode (#11 Fire and Water)the DVD pauses briefly ( maybe just a glitch in my copy), and I have noticed the mentioned occaisional grainy look others have reported. Yes it is shot in British Columbia (and every world SG-1 travels to looks like it),everyone seems to speak english (too impractical to come up with a new language each week), and only three human civilizations in the first three seasons are more advanced than Earth (all the others just sat still it seems). Even with this I've found the series to be one of the most creative and well thought out on television. I wish the following seasons would come out soon.	5.0	One of the best SF series on television	2001-08-07	1	1	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3591RELSN8JRU	ac42	One of the best sci fi television shows of all time. First season is a liittle campy, but it takes off after that. Once the overarching plot develops its hugely entertaining. Took me awhile to fully apreciate the stargate phenomenon. It was Stargate Universe that opened my eyes, and after that I retrospectively explored the rest. Brilliant stuff.	5.0	awesome sci fi	2013-06-20	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1L9JLD1DS97L8	"A. Cox ""Look"""	This series is my favorite on TV.  It allows you an imagination of what IF you could travel to all these planets.  It allows you to experience different scenarios of the universe.  Would recommend the entire series to anyone.  When I was was given the series by a friend I wasn't too interested in watching.  It took one viewing and I was hooked.  Now I have seen the entire 10 years plus the two movies 3-4 times and never get bored anytime.	5.0	STARGATE SG-1	2014-02-04	1	1	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1BHR6IHLPE6E2	Adelaide Cleere	As an avid Stargate fan, I am thoroughly enjoying going back and re-watching Season One.  I appreciate that the episodes are letterboxed and, though they are recorded in Dolby 2.1, the simulated surround sound is great.I am confused, however, by the order of the episodes in the DVD set.  They are *not* in the original order in which they were aired on Showtime, which makes it needlessly difficult for newcomers to Stargate to pick up the arc.  The order in which the episodes were originally aired can be verified at the Showtime Stargate web site and at MGM's Stargate web site.My recommendation (even for fellow fans): Print out the episode guide, switch discs as necessary, and watch them in the original order.I hope when the boxed set of Season II is issued, MGM will put the episodes in the order they originally aired.	4.0	Not in the original order aired	2001-05-30	7	5	2

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1CSZO0MLKZ0D5	"Alexander Atwood ""NunchuckViking"""	"Ive been a big fan of SG1 for awhile.  Season 1 was an amazing 1st season, they didnt take forever to build up the action.  When I watch my seasons of SG1 I feel like a part of the team, I enjoy the action, the diplomacy, just looking at the event horizon of the Stargate is beautiful.  For a tv show from the 90's the graphics are very good, I own seasons 1-4 so far and having them to watch on DVD is great, and are fun for everyone that likes culture, history, and some sci-fi/space travel excitement.  I enjoy Colonel O'neill's decision skills and his spec-ops thought process, Richard Dean Anderson is a great actor.  Daniel Jackson is very perplexing and interesting to watch, his knowledge of history is so awesome because im a history buff, if you enjoy ancient cultures Daniel is your character.  ChristopherJudge's character Teal'c is absolutely great to watch.  He is a warrior, very tactically smart, his use of ""earth terms/metaphors"" are very funny.  And Sam Carter(Amanda Tapping) is a beautiful and very good actress.  I love her genius role of Sam Carter, she fills her role as a genius very well, she is like a mix of Daniel and O'neill, smart and a fighter if need be.I hope any of this leads to someone enjoying SG1 as much as I do.  I would reccomend this to anyone age 13 and up, for good mostly clean fun, adventure and action and space adventure.Alex"	5.0	I love SG1	2009-10-27	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A26S6MNOJ27EBE	Alicja Z.	I am rating the show with 5 stars!!This DVD set should get 2. The quality of the DVDs is not that great. The sound sounded fine on my TV but I took it to my friend's house because I recommended the show to her and was embarressed it did not sound good on her surround sound speakers. This is the dissapointing part.Now, on to the good stuff. This show picks up where the 1994 movie left off. There are some minor holes in the logic (like how did Apothis know to dial the address and just attack the room and then retreat instead of trying to get a foothold on Earth before they wised up) and science (the explanations of wormhole physics that are better developed later in the series are incomplete or just a bit off like the coldness they stress at the beginning to a point of showing ice on their faces that never again gets mentioned past the first few episodes) of the show but the characters and story lines make up for them.The cast is amazing, Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson play off each other well (which just gets better as the show goes on) and Sam Carter after a rough start of having to prove herself in the first episode becomes a three dimentional character by the end of the first season. And Teal'c can only be described by one word, indeed!And yes, this season is a bit of a rough start for the series. The worlds can be fake-looking and a bit low quality but this is the season that starts it all and it is worth watching through just to get to season 2 (and beyond). Growing pains aside, I still re-watch this season all the time and find new things that add meaning to later episodes.	4.0	Great Show, Low Quality DVDs	2011-07-06	2	2	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1R90AR0YTPLEE	Alla Shtaif	Amazing, full credit to everyone who particpated in the making of this show!!! cutting edge graphics, out stnading acting, brilliant story line, and all together entertaing show. Some say the pilot was inappropriate, however i think i was a perfect start to an amazing show. There is absouletly nothing bad to say about this show, (for those who dont like nudity and gave it a bad rating because of it, dont show it to your kids or dont watch). This is a show that will have you on the edge of your seat!!! I recomend it for all, as it has proved to be more then sceince ficton, but intellegent as well.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A34ESGLZ54H7OU	Al P. Walker	I loved this series on tv and bought this set to share on family movie night.  It was listed as NR ,  no surprise, and since it was a tv show that I had seen years ago, I did not look for the tiny  disclaimer on the back of the package that gave a R rating to the Children of the Gods portion that was not shown on tv.  Again, this was a well known tv show, so who knew that it included full frontal nudity of the scene with the kidnapped wife of Dr. Jackson.  Basically, it was a rape scene.  shame on you for not  including the nude scenes  on the description of this package; I would not have bought it to share with younger family members.  It is going in the trash where it belongs.	1.0	stargate sg-l the complete first season	2013-12-22	9	0	9

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A14Y0AI1FATO2K	Amanda	I was very pleasantly surprised! I thought any sci fi show from the 90s would have bad graphics and weak characters. The story mpicks up right after the movie (which is a really good movie). Even without the same actors they flawlessly capture the characters. The story of each episode is written well enough that it is easy to ignore the few 90s special effects.  if you miss firefly and enjoyed the movie, I definitely recommend	4.0	awesome series for any lovers of sci fi	2014-02-06	0	0	0

Have always loved this series; I had watched the extended cut of the original movie the day before and had the urge to watch episode one of the series (yet again).  Did have some trouble when I was watching on my 56 inch screen.  So started viewing on my Kindle Fire HD and had an excellent picture and sound with my ear phones.

This is the first season of a 10 year TV run.  It is a continuation of the Movie Stargate with different actors. Writers present a variety of scenarios/challenges that the team encounter on their travels through a stargate to different planets.

When it moved onto Sci-Fi, I didn't watch it either until much later.  Lately, my dad brought the 2 first seasons and I got him the third season for Christmas and started to watch them in August.  I must say, I was quite impressed at the show.  Of course, I had the movie (not the direct-to-video movies) so I was a big fan of the concept.  Richard Dean Anderson of MacGuyver fame stars as O'Neill as he commands SG1, a team that travels through the Stargate and explores other planets and battling the Goa'uld System Lords...namely Apothis.  On the way, they meet the Asguard (which look like ""Greys"") and befriends one by the name of Thor.  SG-1 also befriends Teal'c, who was Apothis' First Prime.Great Introduction of a series, and I look forward to getting the other seasons as well."	4.0	Take a step into the Stargate	2009-09-01	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1REPL4NU4CRJ8	Amazon Customer	Just wanted to let anyone considering buying this first season on instant video that the second episode - pt. 2 of Children of the Gods - is two minutes short. The scene where Sha're is possessed is almost completely eliminated. Right after Apophis says that she may be the one, the scene cuts to black with a fading scream. I don't know why almost the whole scene is cut - if it was for the nudity, that only comprised a few seconds and the producers themselves cut that out in the standalone disc of Children while leaving the rest intact. So beware if you are a completist.	4.0	Edited second ep	2012-07-14	3	3	0

I've seen the Region 2 releases from the UK which have only 4 episodes per disc and the video quality on those is vastly superior with no really noticable compression artifacts.	4.0	It would get 5 stars if the video quality was better	2001-06-13	9	6	3

That did it. I was hooked. I took advantage of a Black Friday and got the first three seasons. The rest is history... I might get SG Atlantis!The series has great character definition. All characters grow on you and the chemistry among the cast is evident. The visual effects still look good, even without considering this series is twelve years old. The stories are consistently good, with one or two duds, and I like the fact that many are stand-alone episodes, while keeping a defined storyline.Highly recommended, any science fiction aficionado would love to add it to her/his collection.	4.0	Captivating series	2011-01-06	1	1	0

I was mystified in that I couldn't see how it got renewed let alone become the cult hit it is.The production values were low, the characters lacking in charisma and originality, acting was mostly bad, and the writing was nothing more than knock offs of other shows.  The only thing that seemed to stay amusing was seeing the aliens based off various forms of mythology, but it has been done before and this didn't break any new ground.	1.0	mystified	2006-03-28	30	2	28

We got a HUGE surprise when we encountered full frontal nudity in the pilot, and it wasn't just a passing scene.  Enough people have lauded this series, which we still love, but please view the pilot before letting any children in your home see it.Had there been a description of the content of the pilot included with the set, I would have given this set five stars.  All the other sets are five-stars in my book!The series does prompt some great discussions with the kids.  There are clear distinctions between good and evil.  The language gets spicier (more obscenity) as the seasons progress (probably from the origination on cable), but nothing beyond what our kids have heard in the neighborhood.  That always gives us another opportunity to talk.Enjoy the series!	4.0	Have the young ones skip the pilot episode	2005-02-12	20	14	6
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	There are some ideas that seem to work better as a movie than as a show, or better as a TV show than movie.  For example, I think something like FOX's Wonderfalls (I haven't seen it; I'm judging from previews) or Tru Calling would be a better idea as one feature film rather than a weekly TV show.  I'm not saying they don't work as TV shows, they might just work better as films.  Stargate, on the other hand, is completely opposite.  Don't get me wrong; I loved the Stargate movie.  It had a good plot, and it served as a good prequel to the TV show.  However, The idea of multiple Stargates is so much more believeable than just two.  After all, what is the point of only having a desert planet and a planet with rebellious humans?  So Stargate: SG-1 is born.  It follows the adventures of Col. Jack O'Neill (now with two &quot;l's&quot; and played by Richard Dean Anderson), Dr. Daniel Jackson (now Michael Shanks), Capt. Samantha Carter (the beautiful Amanda Tapping), and the former Goa'ould warrior Teal'c (Christopher Judge).  They are SG-1, one of nine SG teams of the SGC (Stargate Command) led by General Hammond (Don S. Davis).  They go to different planets on missons of exploration, diplomacy, and national security.  Each planet brings about new problems, such as the planet where people age one year every day, the planet inhabitted by Mongolians, and the planet of the pacifistic Nox (led by Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Armin Shimmerman).This season seems to focus on more episodic plots with a core story arc rather than a major arc with many offshoots (like 24, Alias, or Angel).  Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with shows that are episodic, but I do enjoy a good arc, and there were times when I was really antsy to find out about what happened with Apophis and Skaara (Alexis Cruz).  I was a little disappointed that Cruz was only in two episodes, but I liked what they did with him.My favorite episodes were definitely the one that dealt with the overall story involving the fight against the Goa'oulds.  That's not to say the the episodic adventures weren't engaging.  I especially like the episode &quot;Tin Man&quot;.  At first, when you realize what has happened to SG-1, you sorry for them, but at the same time, you kind of envy them.  Then, when the truth is revealed at the end, it is almost impossible not to feel a little sad for the doubles.  The episode &quot;Brief Candle&quot; was also a great stand-alone.  It was about O'Neill becoming infected with little things that made him and the rest of the planet's population age at an accelerated rate.  Some other good episodes (both stand-alone and arc) include the pilot, &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, &quot;The Nox&quot;, &quot;Hathor&quot;, &quot;Solitudes&quot;, &quot;There But For The Grace of God&quot;, &quot;Politics&quot;, and &quot;Within the Serpent's Grasp&quot;.  I can't wait to see what happens next season, and I would definitely reccomend this to any sci-fi fan.  If you are not that big on sci-fi, you might want to check it out before you buy it, but I stand by my beliefs that this is one of TV's greatest shows.	4.0	Gateway to Extreme Entertainment	2004-03-20	1	0	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2NJG2VNE0CHV1	"Anthony Ho ""Amateur Photographer"""	The series is far more interesting than the movie, and even if you're not a science-fiction fan, you're going to enjoy this set of DVDs.  This first season set includes the 2-hour R-rated pilot for the Showtime series, and parents should be warned that there is a scene with nudity.  The rest of the series doesn't have nudity, so it's a relatively safe family show, except for some violence.  Like most first seasons of any show, the first few episodes seem tentative and a bit experimental, but mid-way through the first season series, the show hits its stride and never looks back.  By the last few episodes, the show is absolutely riveting and you can't stop watching.  Hard-core sound and visual fans will notice a few oddities with this release--it's only in surround sound and not Dolby 5.1.  And there's some odd graininess to some scenes which can be a little distracting, especially when contrasted with a much clearer close-up shot or reaction shot within the same scene.  MGM should have done a better job of transfering the show to DVD, since it's one of the best TV/Cable shows ever made.  BUY this set; even with the video grain and the lack of 5.1 sound, you won't be disappointed.	4.0	Almost Perfect, But Still a MUST HAVE	2001-07-06	22	19	3

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A4BHT5EUI0ZJF	Ashley Cunningham	"After watching Roland Emmerich's ""Stargate"" a few weeks ago, which was an enjoyable and entertaining movie, I decided to see what the spin-off TV show looked like. I was horribly disappointed and stopped watching the episodes about halfway through the season.The series had an interesting premise: there were other aliens like Ra who had enslaved several other ancient cultures and other stargates. Daniel Jackson's wife and another member of her tribe were possessed by these aliens, and so he wants to get them back. What started out as a good concept quickly went downhill and failed to live up to its premise.One way it failed was in the plot and general pacing. I've seen TV show arcs like those on ""Fringe"" seasons 1 and 2 and ""Heroes"" seasons 1 and 2 where things are gradually explained at a good pace and where most episodes had an important part to play in the overall storytelling. This is not the case with SG-1. Most of the episodes were pointless and had very little to do with the aliens or with Sha'ari's disappearance. Most of the time, the SG-1 team is running around on different planets and solving some problem. The plots like the virus that makes people age quickly, the fiasco with the Mongolian culture (which was extremely preachy), and finding a missing scientist were rather boring, and during the majority of the episodes I would look at the clock to see how much longer the episode was.The characters are typical stereotypes, and Daniel and O'Neill were different from their original forms in the movie. Daniel is still the geek, but he suddenly transformed from an Egyptian expert into a genius historian and anthropologist who practically knows everything. O'Neill is the cocky, occasionally smart-alack military man who is the team's leader. Captain Samantha Carter is the stereotypical woman who is constantly proving that she is just as good as the other men, and the alien Teal'c is emotionless, hard to sympathize with, and largely just a third wheel who occasionally imparts his wisdom to the other members of the team.The cultures depicted on the various planets were, as another reviewer pointed out, very cheesy-looking, as if they had come from some made-for-TV movie. None of them had a feeling of authenticity, and they came across as very silly compared to the original movie, which looked far more genuine. It didn't help that all of the cultures were practically portrayed as being rather childish and immature because they still believe that the aliens are gods, and it felt more like the characters were degrading all the foreign cultures for being different.In conclusion, it was a fascinating concept that was poorly executed. I think I'll just stick to Emmerich's movie from now on."	1.0	Yawn...	2011-06-17	29	4	25

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2XXV9HF169LCF	A. Trotter	Ok, I liked this show a lot when I saw some of the later episodes. And my husband wasn't too sure at all, but wanted to see a bit more anyways. So... I got season 1, as a sort of experiemnt. And we watched the pilot and a few more episodes. And as soon as we could we watched a few more, and a few more... And then we were waiting on season 2 to come out quite impatiently.Premise: travel to other worlds is possible via unexplained alien technology contained in Stargate, which as the only way to access other worlds (and potentially more technology) is way too valuable to take apart for research. Teams of specailly trained personnel are sent through in sets, after initial probes report on atmosphere & stuff. Everyone is out looking for technology that'll help get rid of some parasitic aliens who think human bodies are just lovely, what with the oposable thumbs and all. Said parasites have access to lots of really advanced technology, since they just steal it from whoever they're riding at the moment.So you'll probably get hooked on this series quite easily. The pilot and first 2 episodes, the actors and characters are trying to feel their way, and it's a bit awkward. But it gets progressively smoother as they get better and the show gains depth. It's really, really good by the end of first season.Second season develops the ideas and characters, and the situation, even further. It's not a static show; things change. It's excellent, different, and fun.	5.0	Yes!	2002-10-27	1	0	1

Well Carter fought for women's rights and while good in nature, seriously put SG1 and their endeavors in jeopardy. She acted very self-centered in this episode and while everything turned out well in the end, her actions as a Captain were seriously irresponsible and selfish.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1SSTPV85V87W3	"Big C ""CEL"""	Let me start by saying that I am a huge Stargate fan. I think Stargate is one of the few science fiction shows where you don't have to be a huge fan of science fiction to enjoy the show. I was never big into Star Trek or even Star Wars, but I really enjoy Stargate.The first season of Stargate seems a little dry compared to later seasons. I think it has to do with the story. The first season is very story driven. The whole seasons is mostly focused on helping the viewer understand the entire Stargate concept, and the people involved. I think the reason I found some of the later seasons more enjoyable, is because as the show went on to became more character focused and less focus was placed on the stargate concept that by the end of the first season had been well explained.So if you are already a Stargate fan, but haven't seen the first season, I'd recommend checking out season one. It might explain some things that aren't explained in later seasons. If you haven't seen Stargate before. Keep an open mind and be realize that the show has a lot more to offer in it's later seasons if you give it a chance.	4.0	A Promising Start	2008-01-19	1	1	0

I must admit that it has lost some of it's attraction for me because I have seen the entire series and I don't care for some of the more recent episodes featuring the Ori, the story line went in directions that did not interest me so much. But these earlier episodes where they are still learning about where they can go and how the whole Star Gate thing works still hold my interest, that is why I decided to purchase the first season.	4.0	SG1 the early episodes	2012-08-14	0	0	0

I was considering, in fact, giving it two stars, but it did pick up a little towards the end so I settled on three.This show is blatantly a knockoff of Star Trek. Yes, that's right, the original Star Trek series where Captain Kirk and Spock and Dr. McCoy beam down to planets with alien cultures, but the aliens always speak English.The cheesiness of Star Trek worked for Star Trek, but the late 1960s were simpler times and today we expect better from our TV, but all we get here are recycled Star Trek plots. Like the episode where they bring back a disease. Oops, that was the plot for several Star Trek episodes, and it's the plot for more than one Stargate SG-1 episode during the first season.There is no story arc, so you can watch any of these episodes in any order you want, except for the last DVD where finally there is some plot serialization. But the penultimate episode is an annoying flashback episode.But then the series ends in a cliff hanger. You get no resolution from this set of DVDs, you get tricked into buying the next set.Yes, there was one episode that I really liked. Episode 17, Tin Man.	3.0	Sorry to rain on everyone's parade	2006-01-21	12	0	12

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Brent Butler	"At the start of many TV series, particularly it seems with sci-fi, the show often takes a while to find its legs. Early shows seem to have a different tone, sometimes with characters being portrayed differently than the mold the show eventually settles into. Spock in the early Star Trek shows is a good example. Nimoy showed a lot of emotion in early episodes, even smiling as Uhura sings to his sitar playing in ""Charlie X"". The pilot episode of Star Trek: TNG had some extremely lame moments in it, but after three or four shows, it settled in to the successful form that would serve it for seven seasons.I did not find that situation at the beginning of the Stargate series. These writers and this cast hit the ground running. Their characters run just as true in the pilot as in the very last episode.Another situation that often occurs in the case of movies that are turned into TV series is that the TV series is a pale shadow of the movie, even if successful. ""Logan's Run"" is a good example of this point. As a result, most TV series that spin off from movies don't last long. In the case of Stargate, I like the movie. Heck, I'm probably going to like anything with Kurt Russel. However, I thought it was mostly a bit boring. Nothing much in the way of excitement happened until the end of the movie. When I saw that a TV series adaptation was planned, I was skeptical. I wondered: if they didn't have enough interesting material to fill one movie, how in the world did they expect to fill an hour show from week to week. Here's how: the TV series is MUCH better written than the movie was. Every show is interesting, even those which provide thoughtful looks into various elements of ethics and interaction with alien worlds.In Season One, here are my personal highlights:* Children of the Gods, Part 1 - Since the series began as a Showtime presentation, content was looser. Two attractive women are shown in the nude. I think this was at one time a planned element of the series, but it was for some reason abandoned after the pilot, possibly as a ""what were we thinking!!"" strategy concerning future syndication. LOL Storywise, the pilot does a great job of putting the cast together and getting our heroes into conflict with the main long-term bad guys. The sets are detailed and believable, and special effects are good. The story is exciting and tense. Great start.* The Enemy Within - A poignant episode, as Jack O'Neill's best friend is infested by a Goa'uld.* Emancipation - Carter stands up as a ""woman warrior"" on a world where women are no more than property.* Thor's Hammer - O'Neill and Teal'c must solve a puzzle left by ancient guardians of a planet they visit, and survive an encounter with a remnant of a powerful race once used as hosts by the Goa'uld.* The Torrents of Tantalus - SG-1 discovers that the Stargate has been used by an Earthman before, and set out to see of they can find out what happened to him.* Bloodlines - Teal'c tries to save his estranged son from becoming enslaved by the Goa'uld.* The Nox - a fun show that introduces us to one of the ancient and powerful races (we only get to meet three of those four races during the course of the series).* Hathor - a Goa'uld goddess gets loose and tries to take over Stargate Command, as a stepping stone to enslaving Earth.The quality of the shows on the DVD set is very solid. Picture and sound are both enjoyable. There is a nice special feature at the end of the shows on each DVD, normally a cast member in character introducing you to some Stargate Command ""behind the scenes"" lore. You can buy this season used for less than ten dollars, and new for less than 15 dollars. If you are a sci-fi fan, or liked this series, its a no-brainer!"	5.0	An exciting start	2011-01-19	2	2	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3TUE4JZMN4HYO	"Brian Martin ""foliowyrm"""	"No one can argue that the Stargate series has not been sucessful.  The series, now in it's ninth season and on it's second network, spawned from a decent and underrated movie from the early 90's.  The series centers around ""the stargate,"" a device that was left on earth by aliens centuries ago and now used by a team of adventures to journey to other worlds.  The team that does the exploring is lead by Colonel Jack O'neil (Richard Dean Anderson, aka McGyver).  On their missions, the team encounters friendly humans, hostile humans, friendly aliens and hostile aliens.  But everyone speaks english, so that is good because I hate subtitles.  If you think this sounds like another popular franchise that started in the 60's, you are right.  This is in a lot of ways a retread of Star Trek, but I also think it occasionally surpasses Trek in a few ways.  First and foremost the series does not take itself too seriously and is at times very light hearted.  I like Star Trek too, but one of its flaws is it has gotten way to sanctimonious in the last few decades.  There are more than a few light hearted moments in Stargate SG1 and the series is not affraid to poke fun at itself or its actors.  Anderson usually bears the brunt of that.  Second, the series has much better plot lines and character developement than most sci fi shows these days.  Some of the plots develope over several episodes (or even seasons) and the action in this series is great.Season 1 is the starting point, and as such there are a lot of introductions to characters and to places.  There are some good episodes, but there are also some mediocre ones as well.  On a whole the special effects are good for TV, but some of the sets and costumes of the alien worlds are pretty cheesy. We're talking Hercules/Kevin Sorbo chessy.  There is one set that they changed a little but use over and over again a few times for alien worlds.  Oh well, this was the first season, so there were bound to be some hits and misses.  I will say though they hit more than they miss.  If you are a avid sci fi fan you already know of SG1 and have made up your mind one way or the other.  If you have never seen Stargate: SG1 and have a open mind and a like of action shows, you might want to give this series a try.Pros:good storiesstrong character developementgreat actionoverall very funCons:some questionable production values in this first seasonsome mediocre episodesp.s.

I have enjoyed watching the Stargate franchise for over a decade and a half and I never get tired of watching it again and again. The stories are never boring or lose their lustier over time and are extremely entertaining today as they were when they first aired.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AB5SCA54ENT4Q	Bryon M.	I missed this when it aired and have been waiting for it to come back to Netflix. I've been a Prime member for a few years and thought I'd take a look to see if they offered it. They did and I have been watching a few episodes a day ever since. My fiance is a huge fan of the show and has been happily watching the episodes with me.The show picks up a few years after the movie. Each episode seems to focus on a different culture and people and is fairly self contained. There is an over-arching story developing that each episode is a part of though. My favorite episode so far has involved the Norse people and the god Thor.It is very obvious from the production, dialogue, and special effects that this show is a product of the 90s. That isn't necessarily a bad thing as there are a number of 90s shows that I enjoy, such as Star Trek: The Next Generation & SeaQuest.	5.0	Great 90s SciFi Show	2013-07-25	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AJ7TEVDC31BK7	Byron Sweet	With the entire planet on the line, the folks in the stargate program shine through the black emptiness of space to show the universe that the planet Earth will not stand idly by and let the whole of existence go to hell in a hand basket. This program is based on a true story and as such, there are points that are all too telling with regard to the fallibility of man in moments of weakness or greed. As the old saying goes, &#34;the world can be at once a beautiful and terrible place&#34;. In this case the &#34;world&#34; is a much larger idea. It has been a great learning experience to find out so many incredible things about many of our ancient societies. While much of the footage in this series was shot live during the actual events, certain portions of the show had to be shot in a studio for better story exposition. Often, these parts are needed for context and they blend in seamlessly with the documented footage.	5.0	Stargate, Finally the truth!!!!	2013-07-10	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	The best series since the original Star Trek. Some will say better but consider that Star Trek is a bit old now at 34 and for having such a low budget I'd say not bad. Let's see if Stargate holds up that long. I hope it does quite honestly. I recently finished watching the seventh season on Showtime and am happy it will be continueing into an eighth season on the SciFi channel next year. I had tried to talk my mom and nephew into watching this DVD set for some time since they were not SciFi fans they were not anxious. Eventually I convinced them that Richard Dean Anderson (MacGuyver) would entertain them. Amazing how non-SciFi fans hold up the cross at the hint of the believed evil SciFi TV show or Movie. You don't have to be a nerd to enjoy SciFi people. At any rate I loaned them the first two DVDs which they ended up watching practically non-stop and they couldn't wait to borrow the other three from me. This set will entertain people of all ages whether you are into SciFi or not. It stupifies me that MGM or whoever has the rights for releasing the rest of the seasons is sitting on their hands. I certainly hope at some point they will be lambasted by a huge mass of people for being so neglect in getting these out to the fans and those new to the series alike. I understand that they have all ready released several seasons in England. What's up with that?	5.0	Stargate SG1 is how you spell Entertainment	2001-11-06	2	2	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1J5Y0TH4D0MLW	Cameron	In some of the past reviews, it is brought up that language is the major issue that bothered people (How the Goa'uld and most other cultures are able to speak it, and it seems to be predominant throughout the galaxy). Basically, as the producers and writers have said, you'd eventually get pretty annoyed listening to Danniel/whatever other translater might be there translating every single thing that is said by anyone not from the SGC.Right now, Stargate: SG-1 is the number one weekly hour long show, with one planned spin off and a potential movie in the works. If you want to check out the series, you really should start by watching season one, either by getting the DVDs or watching it in syndication. Unlike other shows, jumping into the middle of the series doesn't work well, since it'll take a while to pick up enough information to understand the intricate and lengthy plot, beyond &quot;Goa'uld are evil, SGC is good.

Far outweighs Star Trek, however all the sci-fi series owe so much to the pioneering Star Trek ideas and imagination.  Stargate is addicting and it just keeps getting better!

So I bought the US box set, since for once ( :-) ), we don't have it first and it seems it will take more than a month to get it here in Europe. This is absolutely a must have box set. Even people who don't enjoy SF series, this is an all-over hit.  Looking at season three, the show has come a long way. Now you sometimes read that season one wasn't really good and not much to look at, but now.. after looking at the first season again I can genuilly say.. It's awesome! There's no show that has ever hooked me (and my wife) to a TV-set for this long. The order of the episodes are correct (not in the way they have been aired in the US, but he way they should have been aired..). Quality and sound are better than average (dolby 2.1). They only minor point is that I have already seen all the featurettes, since they were included on the Season 3 DVD's.  Again.. this box-set is worth the money!	5.0	Ha!	2001-06-04	3	3	0

The chemistry between Jack, Sam, Teal'c and Daniel is beautiful to behold and makes me laugh all the time like a loon. Eqully important contributions are made by General Hammond and Dr. Frasier whose roles serve to ground us in &#34;our&#34; reality as they interact with the SG-1 team.Give this 1st season a chance and you will be hook till the very end!	5.0	Jaffa Kree!	2013-03-24	1	1	0

When I found out it was only going to be shown on Showtime (which I didn't have), I was upset. Then I found out that it's main character was McGyver, and I wasn't really excited anymore. I lost touch with it, and four years later, happened to catch an episode on the Sci-Fi channel. I was bummed that I hadn't seen any of the episodes.Since then, I've become a huge fan. I rented the pilot episode, and loved it. There is action, humor, and great special effects. This, the first season was released, as I said, for Showtime. It was then purchased by Sci-Fi, and that's where it's been ever since. It has drawn a huge fanbase, large enough to merit GateCon, an annual convention similar to those the Star Trek fans know.The first season expands on many of the themes that were touched on in the film. The Goa'uld (not mentioned by name in the film) are the parasites that are mentioned. During this season, we see the true nature of these parasites. We are also introduced to countless peoples from planets visited by the team, which is now called SG-1.If you liked the movie, you'll love the series. Even if you didn't like the film, you might like SG-1, as I've heard many people say. Richard Dean Anderson (McGyver) plays the role that was played by Kurt Russell in the movie. Russell's very stoic, very angry Jack O'Neill is a stark contrast to the one played by Anderson. The reasons for this dramatic change are explained in the pilot episode.There are a lot of episodes that I'd have to say are excellent, but my personal favorite is ""Cold Lazarus"". This episode delves into the subject of O'Neill's young son, who was tragically killed with O'Neill's gun several months before the events in the film take place.Again, all the episodes are good, some better than others.

However Stargate SG-1 is an exception in that it ran so long I forgot how many of the things I was taking for granted by the second half of the shows seasons came to be.  Not as an episode but in a set of episodes building one upon another creating many underlying story lines regarding relations with the different races, how they started and why they became the way they were towards the end.  I just finished season 2 and am pleased that I decided to start at the beginning because the roots of the story are important to the things that happen down the road, especially when being reviewed at a faster pace and being able to see how the relations with the many different relations began and evolved a great deal.  I enjoyed the original series, I'm thoroughly enjoying it for a second time and seeing much I missed the first because I didn't realize the importance when watching originally.	5.0	Great start to great show	2014-05-06	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ABOGI5GSAILNB	"Chrysostom ""CRM"""	Stargate sg-1 is one of the best TV shows ever and certainly one of the top few scifi shows.  Here is what sets it apart.  First, the acting is great. Richard Dean Anderson, who starred in McGuire, is the star of this, but there are several other very good co-stars. Second, the show is funny, even as it is not a comedy.  Third, the show is inspiration and shows a group of heroes who live out their values every day. Much could be learned from their examples. Fourth, the special effects are very good for the time period.  Fifth, the writers do a good job in creating a mostly believable reality, with a good deal of creativity.  Sixth,  the show has a number of high quality guest stars.In my opinion this series gets better as it goes on, and is on par with star trek the next generation and star wars in terms of overall quality for the time it was made. As it was made later than those,  the graphics are much better and the acting more modern.  It is however very different from them as stargate has much superior actors and appeals to non scifi fans due to its overall quality.	5.0	One of the best	2013-03-14	1	1	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AVPY9B8NYUMJG	"C. McManis ""Chuck McManis"""	I enjoyed the StarGate movie, and was doubtful about a series based on the show. When the initial series came out on Showtime I didn't have access to it and then when it moved to FOX I caught it sporadically. Now, finally I've had the chance to start it from the beginning and this has been wonderful. Even more so when things in the current shows refer to events from the first season.WARNING! The last show is the season finale cliff-hanger and the second part is not part of this set! Until the second season was announced I could not recommend this set, but now you can get it and be assured of getting the next set as well.This cast works very well together and the show has a very 'classic' feel in terms of the types of things they address and the questions they raise. Some of the more outlandish shows are entertaining and they've kept the physics consistent (unlike say the X-files ;-). All in all I really enjoy these disks.	4.0	Get the goods on an one of the best SF Series ever	2002-07-19	1	1	0

But since I have been a fan of this series since its birth I feel complied to to write and let anyone thinking of buying this DVD or any other season know that the quality of these recently released DVDs are terrible and the company  really should be embarrassed selling them.  I have recently had to split my original 10 season set so I am forced to keep the ones I recently purchased.  And even then I had to return Season 1 because it had no sound.  There are a lot of Stargate fans and more to come but if I were just beginning to watch the Stargate SG-1 series I am not sure I could sit and watch ten seasons of such poor quality DVDs.	1.0	Very poor quality dvd	2011-03-28	17	15	2
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A853IU3HPURU	cneumer	Having seen some of these episodes over the years, it has been great to go back to the beginning and see how they developed the plot.  It is fascinating how it correlates to a biblical perspective, though ever so subtle.  One of the first episodes is entitled &#34;The First Commandment,&#34; and the story line follows the &#34;false gods&#34; of the aliens.  They refer to the enemy parasites which inhabit the tyrannical aggressors as serpents, and there are other corresponding spiritual factors.  Of course, it is fantasy, but it is well done.  Good principles are in the leadership team, and its success is in their unfailing determination to see the triumph of good over evil.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AUGKRHEPDVVY9	"""crosswinds_used_books"""	I am a big Farscape fan and a SF fan in general, so I figured I'd give the Stargate SG-1 series a try since the reviews listed on Amazon.com were so positive, and the price for the box set was reasonable.  However, after having watched the first episode, I disagree that Stargate SG-1 is worthy of such high praise.  Perhaps the episodes get better as they go along, I will have to see.Here are my problems with the first episode of Stargate SG-1:(1)  Lousy, boring, uninspired, no fun dialog.(2)  Continuity - At one point one of the characters says something about his beer &quot;going to his head&quot; when he hadn't even taken a sip of it yet.(3)  Full frontal female nudity - I don't really care about nudity, but I was surprised to see it because I figured the DVD only contained what was shown on TV.  I'm glad I wasn't watching this with kids around.  The nudity was not brief either.  You get a nice long look with several camera angle shots.  I'm sure all the 13 year-old boys out there will love this DVD.(4)  Why use characters from the original movie?  The Stargate SG-1 actors do a great job imitating the mannerisms of the original actors from the movie, but why not just have new characters?  I would rather not have to compare the new actors to the old, and the series to the movie.  The movie, which I liked even though the ending was not so hot, is still much, much better than the Stargate SG-1 TV series.(5)  Dumb logic.  Why not just re-bury the Stargate in the Earth's sand rather than send a nuclear bomb through the Stargate to blow up the other side?  This worked before, why not again?  A lot of the ideas and actions of the characters in Stargate SG-1 are just stupid.  I'm no rocket scientist and even I can see the logic flaws.(6)  What's up with the dumb woman scientist?  Come on, I can't for a minute think she is a scientist - not with dialog like &quot;wow, this is incredible&quot;, over and over again.  Every once in a while she spouts off some ridiculous &quot;techno-babble&quot;.  At one point, the her character confronts Richard Dean Anderson about him not wanting her on the team because she is a woman.  Forget the woman thing - she's not qualified as a scientist.	2.0	Stargate SG-1 dialog not very smart	2001-06-06	54	4	50

The sound is not up to snuff (in fact, the MGM logo sounds beautful, but the rest of the sound on the disc is noticabley quieter and not nearly as profound).  Also, the image transfer could have been much better.  Through many of the episode, the picture looks grainy--not sharp like DVDs should be.  If it weren't for the fact that the show itself is very good, these discs from a technical standpoint are subpar.If you are looking for just the show, these will do.  If you are looking for superior sound and picture--wait.  Perhaps they will fix these or issue a recall, but the quality is not there.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2JUMQUP5OBQWA	"CSH ""CSH"""	But this series is the best I have encountered. The acting, the writing, the directing. The thing that seems to make it the best out there(and I have in my day been a rabid fan of everything from Star Wars to Buck Rogers to Andromeda) is that it is set in the present day. The episodes from the first season you could watch today and feel that they were just made. While there is advanced technology, we don't jump right into it like in most science fiction, and so the viewer does not have to suspend so much disbelief from the beginning. This could very well be a Black Project of the military right now, that is how realistically the series is presented.Also, the acting is superb. Don S. Davis, Christopher Judge, Amanda Tapping, Michael Shanks, and last but not least Richard Dean Anderson were superb choices for the primary roles, and the supporting cast is excellent, with many recurring characters throughout all the seasons, not just this one. General Hammond is a down to Earth all-business, common sense sort of man who lets his people be themselves as long as they accomplish the mission. Jack O'Neill is a smart alec pain in the neck who would go to any length for his friends and is a seasoned special operations soldier who even facing death can crack a joke-and who is still grief-stricken. Teal'c is the perfect straight man for O'Neill's joker, being an excellent warrior in his own right, and the most eloquent speaker of the group. Samantha Carter is the astrophysicist who understands the mechanics of the Star Gate system, and the person O'Neill relies upon for technical expertise. A soldier and a scientist, she is the pure explorer, and is part of the teams conscience. Daniel Jackson is the linguist who originally translated the symbols to open the stargate, and along with Jack O'Neill was on the original mission. As a speaker of twenty-three languages and a historian, he is a valuable asset in understanding and deciphering both the ruins and technology that the team encounters. A civilian who also has suffered personal tradgedy and the scorn of his profession, he is not afraid to do what is right. His selflessness is the crowning of the teams skill compliment, giving him the ability to look from a view point different from those of the warriors with whom he serves while keeping their respect.With this team as the flag of the SGC, we go to hundreds of worlds and encounter triumph and tradgedy, friends, foes and phenomenon galore. Having seen(and bought) the first six seasons, I personally recommend this as the best science fiction series made to date, and advance as evidence the fact that they have made eight seasons with a ninth to commence this spring. But this is the foundation with my two most favorite episodes to date being in this first season, the Torment Of Tantalus and There But For The Grace Of God. This season also has subtitles, and I have not encountered that on any other season. I highly recommend this series in general and this season in particular.CSH	5.0	I have seen my share of science fiction...	2004-11-23	5	5	0

Saw the movie, and then the DVD of the first season.  I agree with the person who wrote about the pilot episode.  I'm happy that the rest of the episodes aren't like that.  Still, I think it sets up the premise very well, and I enjoyed the TV shows better than the movie with Russell.  (Of course, I'm just slightly biased towards Anderson!)I'm really glad that the episodes are coming out on DVD, since that'll allow me to watch everything in order, which will probably make things make a lot more sense.  Wish MGM'd make sure to release them regularly.  Doesn't have to be fast, since it costs to collect these set, but just so that we can be sure to get everything!

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ANPKHT4K18T4R	"""darrelljackson@ozemail.com.au"""	SG-1 would have to be my favourite show on at the moment, so I was ecstatic to have the chance to buy the entire first season on DVD, as in Australia and the UK they only released a &quot;best-of&quot; DVD of season 1 and have continued with all episodes from there. If you are from outside the US or Canada you will have to get your player modified however, but it is worth it! The episodes are presented in widescreen format and Dolby Surround sound. In some scenes there is noticable grain, however I didn't find it too distracting; acceptable for a TV series. The show has a freshness that other sci-fi series seem to lack lately, although I still enjoy them too. I think what makes this work so well is the characters - the cast and writers have done a great job making them &quot;real&quot; in an &quot;unreal&quot; setting. Of course the stories and effects hold their own, making the whole show very enjoyable. Bring on Season 2 box-set!!	5.0	The best sci-fi series currently airing	2001-09-25	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1SYQZ8F6HFAZT	Dave Erickson	I'm viewing the series for the second time right now.  I first rented the disks from Neflix.  I missed the series when it first aired on TV about ten years ago, partly because the original movie did nothing for me.  But the series is very good.  It requires a suspension of belief, more so than most science fiction.  The so called advanced alien weapons used by the Jaffa are these silly shoot from the hip staffs that miss their targets 95% of the time.  They run around in Egyptian hawk men type armor, and their space ships look like flying pyramids.  But, the storyline eventually becomes very engaging.It's not at first, however.  Season one takes some getting used to, and the plots of each episode seem dated and previously covered by the original Star Trek Series.  It's a slow start for a great series.  Season two becomes more interesting, and by season three, the writers have got their feet planted firmly on the ground and the show is reaching it's stride.  New characters are introduced throughout, and with the introduction of Claudia Black toward the end of the series, the show takes on a delightful twist that brings new life and keeps the series going for a full ten years.I think every science fiction buff needs to watch this program, but give it time, and do not judge it on the episodes of season one.  I think the series is a much watch.  And when you are done, you can take on Stargate Atlantis, which has higher production values, a more modern feel, and extends the fun for an additional 5 years.	5.0	Great Series, But with a Slow Start	2014-05-05	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AUD0C37FRGAP5	davepy	I'd really like to give the first season of SG-1 3.5 stars, but not having that option, I'm rounding up.Basically, as others have stated, the 1st season of the long running hit series, Stargate SG-1, isn't its best, and by a long shot.  While it's still very entertaining for the most part, there are some out-and-out stinkers, like the preachy Emancipation.  In fact, the first dozen episodes or so try to emulate Star Trek in traveling to a new world each episode, dealing with the new civilization they find while delivering some social moral.  It's only after they abandon that conceit and concentrate on the main plotline of the Goa'uld threat that the stories become more compelling.Fortunately for the show, in spite of the uneven early writing, the cast really shines through.  The characters are extremely likeable, and their chemistry seems unforced, and is infectious.  There is an easy humor that flows through the dialogue, and a sense of not taking itself too seriously.  In the end, it's a fun, and fairly addictive show that gets far better in the later seasons.	4.0	It gets much better...	2006-06-08	9	9	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"""Stargate SG-1"" picks up right where the movie left off with a fantastic two-hour pilot that is far superior to the wretched theatrical feature.  The series maintains continuity with the movie but thankfully transcends it, providing some really outstanding shows in a somewhat spotty first season that also features some unfortunate clinkers.  It turns out that there is a vast network of Stargates that provides access to planets throughout the galaxy, thereby allowing various SG teams to get themselves into a variety of predicaments.  The series focus is on the main team, SG-1, which consists of Col. Jack O'Neill and Dr. Daniel Jackson from the film, now played by Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Shanks, and new additions Capt. Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and the rebel Jaffa warrior Teal'c (Christopher Judge).Stand-out episodes include the pilot ""Children of the Gods,"" ""The Torment of Tantalus"" (SG-1 searches for a man who went through the gate in the 40s), ""The Nox"" (SG-1 meets an enigmatic race that seems unconcerned by the Goa'uld threat), ""Solitudes"" (O'Neill and Carter exit the Stargate in a very unexpected place), and ""There But for the Grace of God"" (an alternative reality episode that shows the devastating effect of a Goa'uld attack on Earth).  A fine series.PS: Certain reviewers should lay off Grace for being dismayed at exposing her children to unexpected nudity.  It was a surprise for me, too, albeit a pleasant one since I wasn't watching with my children.  A warning should appear on screen before the episode since there is nothing in the rest of the series that would lead one to expect it."	4.0	From terrible movie to good series	2005-08-01	6	3	3
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1SQ48UIU98K0J	David D Ochoa	"This episode was the show's first dive into alternate realities and they did a good job of it.  From the plot, we can ascertain that if Daniel Jackson would have said no to Catheryn from our reality, things could have gotten this bad for us too.The last scene leaves you with a good, but bad feeling.  The destroyer of worlds is coming, so-to-speak.There is one continuity error. When the alternates try to dial the Beta site, they say that chevron 2 is ""encoded,"" however, the symbol shown is Earth's, which is the 'point of origin' and should be the last, 7th, symbol, not the 2nd."	5.0	Fantastic Episode	2012-09-10	0	0	0

When it was announced that Richard Dean Anderson was making a TV version of it in Vancouver I thought &quot; Eygpt in Canada, riiight...&quot; But it at least MacGyver was working again.Then I caught a marthon of the first season on a Showtime free Weekend. I subscribed to Showtime the next day.Not the perfect show, but it is funny, exciting, doesnt take itself too seriously and the cast and SFX are very good. It is the best example of what is increasingly rare on TV, a good adventure show.Season 1 sets the pace for the increasing better seasons, topping out at Season 4 I think. IT is still a fine show, better then 98% of the stuff out there ( and FAR the best thing on Sci-Fi Channel currently).Besides, it has MAcGyver in it!

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A30NAIQPTIGPW5	"Dennis G. Duryea ""Justin Kipper"""	Expanding the story onward from a very underated feature film, this first season of the SG-1 team falls onto the same track as other ongoing series...basically, the best seasons are the 2nd or 3rd seasons, after the actors have settled into their characters, the primary backstories are told, and the writers know what to do with these fictional worlds. But naturally, season 1 sets are essential to the collector despite the growing pains associated with the format.Overall, season 1 is good and worth watching, laying the groundwork for the later seasons. Continuity in the SG-1 series is incremental and grows as the series goes along...not as tight and well-crafted as Babylon 5 (nothing can match that!), but superior to the lethargic Star Trek universe. The season starts well with the fine pilot episode (some complained about brief nudity being shown in the episode, that it was not appropriate for family viewing; yet they complained nothing about the sometimes foul language and burning holes being blasted into people throughout the series...maybe they should stick to old John Woo movies and Sam Peckinpah films for their family viewing...don't let those kiddies see a bare breast or something, it could warp their minds!), bogs down a bit in the middle, and picks up near the end with an excellent cliffhanger going into season 2 (despite a lame clip-show leading up to it.) Overall the season is a bit fluffy and light, but not as juvenile as DS9's early seasons. The casting is very good...I never cared to watch McGyver, but Anderson is a superb actor, and breathes life into both his character and the show. Amanda Tapping seems a bit too perky at first, but is certainly more believable than B5's Tracy Scroggins. The rest of the cast is good too, and the characters grow as the series progresses.Picture quality is so-so in the early episodes, being shot on 16mm, but thankfully MGM does a fine job with the enhanced 16x9 transfer (though somewhat grainy)...sound is not too bad considering it is not 5.1 in this first season. No extras to speak of, just a few short promos of the episodes. Packaging is good, separate boxes for each disk and a big slipcover to hold them all, much better than the insane and troublesome Star Trek boxes. Best of all, an excellent price for a complete season of a tv show!Overall, quality stuff here. Not a futuristic, starships-dogfighting type series, but an enjoyable change of pace that most fans of the genre will enjoy, if they accept it for what it is. Give it a try, it's well worth the small price these sets are going for.	3.0	Not great, but worth the investment	2005-11-07	10	6	4

I was totally wrong!When I saw the first episode, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they picked up the story from 'when we last met..', and their choice of MacGyver playing Kurt Russell's role (and Michael Shanks playing Spader's character)  ended up being inspired.  Not only was the casting excellent, (they also brought the actual actors who played other key roles in the film), the writing was absorbing, and the direction right on the money.  They kept it real, and although there are some funny, campy moments, they kept it dramatic and serious, and that served the story perfectly, aligning with the tone of the film, yet creating their own 'universe', which evolved so well that the show has run for over a decade, and spawned several spin-offs.To the production crew, the talent, and everyone involved in SG-1, THANK YOU!  Ya Done Good!!, You've entertained us, thrilled us, scarred us, and made us think.  What else do you want for next to nada?	4.0	"STARGATE SG1 - An excellent continuation of the story first presented in the film of the same name (""Stargate"")"	2014-05-20	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AMNLT93LGXQ5N	"Donald Joseph Koch ""Avid Movie Buff"""	"Stargate SG-1 Season 1  (Thinpak)I thought the movie ""Stargate"" was inventive, refreshing and exceptionally well done (in a jingoistic sort of way), but I must admit that I was a late comer to the television series. I viewed it as ""just another SciFi series"" - plus it was on HBO and I refuse to pay for television. My nephew, however, kept prevailing upon me to watch the show. I had convinced him to watch Babylon 5 and he insisted on returning the favor. Still I resisted; Richard Dean Anderson (a perennial favorite with my mother as McGiver) just didn't strike me as the heroic leader type but I had to admit that the original story was intriguing, and Amanda Tapping is oh, so easy on the eyes. So I relented and borrowed his set of Season 1 discs. I am so very pleased that I did.I am not only impressed with the producers; I greatly admire them for picking up the story where the movie ended. Not only did it provide unheard of continuity but it also demonstrated immense respect for the original concept. And that is the true strength of Stargate SG1. The artists behind the production (actors, directors, designers, technicians, and yes, the suits) all embraced a vision that is both compelling and entertaining. They have embarked on a journey to tell a story of an Earth that might have been. They have explored our mythology in a way that compels us to ask ourselves why we believe what we believe. They have required us to think and that is what elevates Stargate SG1 to the status of ART.Not every episode is a five-star-affair but the entire story arc crosses into the realm of true literature. The enthusiasm and intensity the cast and crew pour into every episode is abundantly evident, and the dedication of the writing and production staff burns with a white-hot ferocity.For anyone who is serious about building a world-class Science Fiction collection (and I am) Stargate SG1 is a must-have. To make that job even easier the new Thin-Pack release takes up even less shelf space so there's one less reason to hold off on buying the entire set. I am already up to season 3 and in 7 months I'll have the entire story in the can. It doesn't get any better than this."	5.0	Late bloomer	2007-04-27	6	4	2

Lots of action, and lots of adventure throughout the series. Sad to see it all end. Would love to see another series start up in the near future. Stargate Universe(2009) was the poorest excuse for a continuation of the stargate series and in my opinion.. not worth wasting your time. I suggest watching this in order. The first Stargate (1994) w/ Kurt Russell and James Spader. then the first 7 Stargate SG-1 series (97-2004), before beginning Stargate Atlantis. Then watch Atlantis and SG-1 in succession. The same with the SG-1 Movies. Do not watch  The Ark of Truth (2008)  until the end of the 10th and final season of Stargate SG-1. Continue with the final 2 years of Stargate Atlantis until the end of the the series, then watch the climatic ending with the movie Continuum (2008). There was one more movie in the works...Stargate Revolution and was never released and the entire Stargate saga was put on the shelf...sigh	5.0	Top of the list of must watch	2013-05-29	0	0	0

All I can say is this is one of the most imaginative and engaging series on TV, and certainly the most underrated.  I'm totally hooked.The thing I like most about the series is the continuity between episodes, which deal on a regular basis with history, mythology, archeology, religion and other thought-provoking subjects.  Of course, there is the expected introduction and use of technology, but it rarely dominates the story...it merely provides a vehicle to tell it.  I find this to be a refreshing change from Star Trek.This series is like a novel I can't put down.  I feel more like I'm watching a long movie as opposed to a series of hour-long TV episodes.  The plot twists keep me glued to the set...and I'm not a TV watcher.  Highly recommended, and not just for the ""Star Trek"" types.  I think there's enough drama and passion in the series to satisfy those of softer hearts.If you're wondering whether you should spring for the series, let me tell you...this would be a must-have at any reasonable cost.  ......"	5.0	Best series nod...	2004-02-07	4	4	0

I always enjoyed the movie Stargate, so I was glad to hear that Showtime planned to make a TV series of it. The special effects let me down at first, but not the acting or writing. Richard Dean Anderson is perfect for the part of Jack, so much so that it now seems strange seeing Kurt Russell in the part when I watch my DVD of the movie. The special effects budget for the series has obviously grown over time. So has the mythology. This show provides a showcase of many talented people (on both sides of the camera) and keeps building on the possibilities that past episodes have raised. If you like science fiction, this DVD set would be a great addition to your collection.	5.0	Loved the movie, love the series.	2001-03-23	2	2	0

I can finally see the episodes I missed.  This series is a great balence between action, science, and great storytelling.  Richard Dean Anderson as O'Neil is a riot!  Espically when he get's this blank look on his face after Daniel or Carter say something way over his head (Which happens a lot).After seeing this set, there is something the buyer should know:1.  The series is shot in Canada, and to put it in a nice way, the cameras they used wern't exactly A+ equipment.  That's why some scenes appear grainy.  It's not the conversion to DVD, the grainyness was there on Showtime and when the show was syndicated on TV.2.  This show is presented in Dolby 2.0 Surround.  To get the best experience, set your home theater to 2 Channel Dolby, and have the reciever send the two channels to both front and surround speakers.  Some episodes of the series have some really neat surround effects if you listen carefully.I put this series on par with X-Files, and Babylon 5, all great series in terms of storytelling.	5.0	Stargate SG-1 - One of the greatest one-hour programs on TV	2001-05-30	70	67	3

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), and hopefully die and are forgotten.That wasn't the case with the spinoff of the 1995 movie ""Stargate,"" an okay science fiction movie that spawned an excellent television series, ""Stargate SG-1."" The first season is not nearly as brilliant as the ones that followed it, but it's a welcome change from distant space operas -- excellent writing, acting, and a sense of humor about itself and its characters.The Stargate has been inactive for a year -- until it is activated, and a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap a young officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement to learn what really happened on the planet of Abydos, and where these mysterious aliens have come from.O'Neill and a small team go to Abydos and find Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) who has been learning about a vast network of Stargates over the past year. But when Daniel's wife Sha're and brother-in-law Skaara are abducted by the same warriors, O'Neill, Jackson and Air Force scientist Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) use the Stargate to venture to where they're being kept.What they find is an alien race who inhabits human hosts, the Goa'uld, and their ruthless slave warriors, the Jaffa. Carter, O'Neill and Jackson are captured by the powerful Apophis -- but to escape, they must have the help of an unlikely ally: Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Apophis' First Prime. Since Earth has now annoyed the Goa'uld, several exploration teams are formed to go through the Stargate and find weapons and allies.And SG-1 -- Carter, O'Neill, Jackson and Teal'c -- encounters some very strange problems: a plague that turns people into savages, a people who live only a hundred days, a Viking planet, a Stargate explorer stranded since 1945, a little girl turned into a bomb, the seductive Goa'uld queen Hathor, and coming back as robots. And when the military shuts down the SG program, Daniel reveals that the Earth is about to be destroyed by Apophis' armies...The first season of ""Stargate SG-1"" isn't the most impressive, though the last three episodes hint at the series' future greatness. And thankfully,  it drops the usual space opera stuff --  instead we get Stargates, real military, and a very plausible reason why everybody in the galaxy (more or less) looks just like us.It's graced with kitschy Egyptian-styled sets, lots of shoot-em-up action from Marines and Air Force, and plenty of planets influenced by Earth cultures, like the Minoans and the Vikings. Best of all is the snappy dialogue, mostly from the tart-tongued O'Neill (""Temperature--ground 1700 degrees Fahrenheit. Air--seems to be in pockets, ranging from 1500 degrees down to 200."" ""Sounds like LA"").And the makers add some poignant and/or warm scenes, such as the eager Abydonian teenagers celebrating with O'Neill and his pals, Teal'c reunion with his outcast family, or Sam bonding with a doomed little girl. All the characters get these moments, which really makes them seem human.Instead of Kurt Russell's suicidal O'Neill from the movie, Anderson does a quirky, disrespectful, pop culture-lovin' guy with a hidden tragic past -- his ""Cold Lazarus""double role is one of the best of the show. Tapping and Shanks are also great, as an enthusiastic geek and a smart, capable military woman. Sadly Judge gets shortchanged as the stern, honorable Teal'c, but he's brilliant when he's spotlighted.The first season of ""Stargate SG-1"" is not the best of the series, but it's still a solid, imaginative sci-fi story with some great writing and even better acting. A must-have for sci-fi buffs."	4.0	Through the stargate	2007-06-14	22	20	2

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A60PQSFWSQK8K	Erik Rupp	Stargate SG1 is the best Sci-fi adventure series in years (well, since Babylon 5 anyway), and is closer in spirit to the original Star Trek series of the 60's than any of the recent Star Trek series.  The show is a fun adventure series, and also has some good Science Fiction concepts.  The scripts are well written, and the cast (led by Richard Dean Anderson) is excellent.  The characters are well rounded, and the stories are exciting.  The special effects are top notch as well.  This box-set features all of Season 1 in anamporphic widescreen, and has some nice extra features as well (featurettes, promo trailers, etc), making it a &quot;must-have&quot; for any Science Fiction OR adventure fan.  If you check the other reviews you can see the episodes on the 5 discs, but - trust me - this is a great set.  BUY IT!  MGM has already said that the release of Season 2 on DVD will be based on the sales of Season 1 - so BUY IT!  The show seems to get better every year, so seasons 2 &amp; 3 are must have's on DVD as well. They won't be released on DVD unless Season 1 does reasonably well - so BUY IT!  (You will not regret it.  This is a GREAT show!)	5.0	A must have for fans of Science Fiction and Adventure	2001-05-24	41	37	4
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AYMPVLWFKTAYE	"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic"""	Generally speaking, I'm entirely wary of a TV series based on a feature film, so I began watching &quot;SG-1&quot; with a great deal of skepticism. However, the outstanding cast, writing, sets, special effects, score, costumes and direction won me over in short order.The series begins where the film left off, basically; people have discovered a device on Earth that opens wormholes to other planets all over the galaxy, and have used it to travel to other worlds. On many of these worlds, they have found actual human beings - not just humanoids, but humans. How can this be? A powerful alien race called the Goa'uld have distributed human beings across space to serve as slaves and hosts for their snake-like bodies. The members of the Stargate team on Earth have decided to defy the Goa'ulds, and attempt to liberate all cultures from their oppression.That's the basic premise for the entire series, which sounds like a fairly simple plot; however, the writers have come up with exceptionally creative situations and environments for the SG-1 team to become involved with, and the show examines human nature very closely in many episodes. There were only a couple of episodes in this season which I didn't enjoy, and many that moved me to tears. The writers liberally sprinkle wit and humor throughout the shows, and the cast delivers their lines expertly.Col. Jack O'Neill, played by Richard Dean Anderson, plays the Kurt Russell character from the movie, and provides a lot of the comic relief. A straight-forward, no-nonsense leader with a bit of a tough crust that (naturally) covers his sensitive caring self, he guides the team through their missions to other worlds, making the sorts of difficult command decisions that officers so often must make under combat situations.Captain Samantha Carter, played by Amanda Tapping, is the scientist on the team - she's much like a female MacGyver. She is a strong role model for women, fighting every bit as well as the men, not backing down from anything, but also not sacrificing her femininity (which sounds hokey and clunky - but I couldn't come up with a way to phrase this, sorry. In a nutshell, she's a very strong, tough woman who doesn't try too hard to be one of the guys.) Tapping is one of my favorite women in television.Michael Shanks plays Dr. Daniel Jackson, the James Spader role from the film, and is the team's archaeologist. He enables the team to read and speak ancient languages, as well as helping to understand different cultures and artifacts. Shanks looks so much like Spader that at times, it's pretty eerie, and he does a great job in this role.The fourth member of SG-1 is Teal'c (Christopher Judge,) formerly a high-ranking member of the personal guard of one of the powerful Goa'ulds. He is recruited by SG-1, and joins the good guys, leaving his family and all he knows on his home planet behind. His special knowledge and abilities assist the team greatly in innumerable ways, and Christopher Judge carries off this role better than anyone else could.While there is an overriding arc to the story, this show is largely episodic, much in the way of &quot;Star Trek.&quot; There are a few instances of &quot;to be continued,&quot; but in most cases, the team travels to a world at the beginning of the show, encounters some situation requiring their assistance, and then returns to Earth at the end. Again, this sounds formulaic and perhaps dull, but the creativity of the writing team shines through in almost every single show, and each one is a gem. They have attracted guest stars of considerable talent, too; James Earl Jones, Arman Shimerman, Elizabeth Hoffman, and Dom and Peter DeLuise to name a few.The DVD set contains a few interesting featurettes focusing on a couple of the characters, as well as the cast and crew in general. I find the primary appeal of the set to be sitting down and watching the episodes without commercial interruption, and without having to wait a week to see what happens next.This is a terrific show, and anyone who enjoys Science Fiction will likely appreciate &quot;SG-1.&quot;	5.0	One of my favorite shows	2002-11-15	21	18	3

Great sci-fi story concept - Going through a worm-hole to other planets in the UNIVERSE.  All the SG-1 characters are very likeable.  They become family to the viewer and you care about them.  Not very political at all.  Unlike other long running sci-fi shows this one does not deal in political or moral concepts.  It is strictly how do we handle the things we encounter in our journeys.  Most stories build on previous stories, so you may get lost picking it up in the middle.  I own season 1-8 and have watched them in that sequence.  The only thing that frustrated me from time to time were the episode endings. There is so much more you want to know about the ending of an episode that it kinds of leaves you hanging. I guess there is just so much you can get into 44 minutes.	5.0	Awesome Series!	2007-06-27	0	0	0

I'm just sad that I didn't become a fan sooner, this series is fantastic. I haven't seen the other seasons yet, but I can't wait to start watching season two.

Coincidentally, I had seen the movie which came out, I believe, in 1994 [I wasn't enthusiastically impressed -- hence, the memory lapse.But Stargate: SG-1, with Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks [my favorite character], Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge -- they are superlative actors!  Honestly, they couldn't have come up with a better cast ANYWHERE!  Okay, back to the DVD:  the pilot is excellent.  Firstly, I had no idea how all this started.  Finally, my questions, doubts, etc. were allayed.  The DVD is configured/ formatted in a way that you feel as though you are in a theater.  The film quality is probably the only attribute I would say ""needs improvement"" [but it's still far superior to Prime Time television].  The storylines, audibles, and the linear progression of the Stargate story -- all are excellent.  The interviews and the addendum stuff is also great!I strongly recommend Stargate: SG-1 to all Science Fiction 'aficionados'.  It is riveting.  I was literally ambivalent as to what to do.  Emotionally, I couldn't tear myself away from the series and wanted to stay up the entire weekend watching the whole 5 disc set.  The rational/ practical side of me said:  ""Gar, you need to stretch out your pleasure here.  Don't get it all at once.  Take bits of it and relish it slowly"".  That's what I am doing; although it is difficult because I want to know what is going to happen NEXT.Folks this Boxed Set is fantastic.

After all, the movie was only so-so to begin with.  When the series came to Showtime it was no big deal to me because I did not get Showtime and, again, the movie was no big deal.  When the series moved to the Sci-fi channel I was even more skeptical.  After all, I've yet to see any 'original' programming on the Sci-Fi channel that wasn't complete garbage.  However, I started tuning in on and on-again, off-again basis and began to realize, &quot;Hey - this is good stuff.&quot;  So I started watching it regularly in no time at all I was hooked.Stargate is as good as sci-fi gets and better by far than most any other sci-fi offering out there.  The special effects and writing are better than anything Star Trek and Star Wars have come up with since 1982.  (Star Trek would sell it's soul to be Stargate and Star Wars, completely lacking in soul, just can't compete.)  The writing is very, very good and ranges from extreme hard-core sci-fi to witty and light-hearted fare.  And when the action kicks into overdrive - oh baby, just hang on and ride it out.  Not even Miami Vice can match Stargate's gunplay.The first season does a good job of setting the storyline and by the time you reach the first season finale you'll see why Stargate fans are so vociferous in their defense of this show.  The last show of Season 1 and the first show of season 2 are better by far than ST:TNG's Best of Both Worlds.Whadday waiting for - order this already.	5.0	Stargate = Best...SciFi...Ever	2003-10-20	9	6	3

Stargate seems like someone trying to reinvent Star Trek and doing a poor job of it.  To me, the premise is the same for both series....exploring new worlds in outer space.  I would liken season one of stargate to the original Star Trek that first aired on TV back in the 1960s. The special effects are not impressive, the storylines are predictable and bland. It's hard to believe that this season of Stargate was airing in 1997 --  at the same time as Star Voyager. I'm amazed that so many great TV shows have been cancelled after the first or second season and that Stargate was continued.

Ever since I was very young I have been a huge fan of Star Trek, and just science fiction in general; it's what I grew up with. My father often watched Sci-fi channel, so he was the one who first discovered SG-1, and he got me into it, and here I am today; a full-fledged fan.Stargate is a wonderfully written show, with plenty of awe-inspiring special effects, character development, romance, drama, and action. Though not for everyone, it is certainly a series worthy of being given a chance.If you enjoy such shows as Star Trek, Farscape, and Babylon 5, then maybe you should give Stargate a try!PS- A few people have commented that this Season 1 box set did not include the last episode of Season 1 (since the last episode in the set is a ""to be continued""). That cliffhanger episode is, in fact, the FINAL episode of Season 1. Like Star Trek, the seasons (at least 1-6) end like that so it keeps your interest, and can blend right the next season.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1F0ZCUBM6E2KQ	G.L.	I have seen many Sci-Fi series' over the years, but SG-1 really brings a good storyline, amazing characters, both regular and recurring, and is centered around a device that allows transport from one planet to another.  That device is called a Stargate.  Season 1 takes place about a year after the events in the Stargate movie, which is also a good buy from Amazon.  The Stargate in Cheyenne Mountain is activated, and mysterious soldiers in serpent costumes come through the gate and attack the Air Force personnel near the gate.  After this attack, Col. Jack O'Neill (played by Richard Dean Anderson) is called back into duty, and to find out what happened.  A team of explorers led by O'Neill is formed, with Capt. Samamtha Carter (played by Amanda Tapping), Dr. Daniel Jackson (played by Michael Shanks), and a Jaffa warrior that joins the team, named Teal'c (played by Christopher Judge).  The team's base of operations is commanded by Maj. General George Hammond (played by Don S. Davis).The first season contains 22 episodes, in anamorphic widescreen format (1.78:1), and is mixed with a Dolby Surround audio track.  Stargate Sg-1, in my opinion, is one of the best Sci-Fi series' around.	5.0	An amazing Sci-Fi Series!!!	2006-04-25	8	7	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1O2ITD0S3YJVH	H. B. Baldwin	Stargate, the movie set up a universe that has a limitless opportunity for developement and Stargate SG-1 is a worthy successor to the movie.  Being a person that loves Egyptian mythology and culture, I was drawn to the movie and when the series came out it was something that I hoped would continue that line of story developement.  I was not disappointed.  The recasting at first was disturbing, being used to the movies, but each of the cast members that took over the roles of the movie characters added to the personality of the character and developed into full fledged personalities.  Richard Dean Anderson brings a unique quality to O'Neil character in a way that he can only do.  The genious casting of Amanda Tapping, Michael Shanks and the rest of the cast make for interesting additions to the original characters as well as drawing on the some of the original cast members of the movie to reprise their roles.  Great writing and entertaining story lines make this one of the best shows that developed from a movie.	5.0	Stargate expanded.	2010-11-02	0	0	0

The Season One Box Set is a bargain and a great experience. I don't watch the program on TV, so I did not have any experience with it.  I took the hint from reviewers.  I'm very glad I did.I won't get into the plots or character development.  I could always second guess the writers and producers.

All the episodes have the correct aspect ratio when shown on properly configured equipment. The Stargate and various other round object are indeed round. The Stargate episodes on these dvd's are enhanced for widescreen TV's 16x9 (Anamorphic). Audio is okay as well with the exception that some episodes have a different base audio level thus you may have to adjust your volume control from episode to episode.The extra material is not bad but is the same as supplied with the second and third season dvd release in region 2.If you are a Stargate fan (who is not), this DVD box set is for you.Well done MGM Home Entertainment.	5.0	No Serious Technical Problems With This Release	2001-06-23	4	4	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ANPE9R0D2G8AO	Inanna Arthen	I had never seen any of the Stargate TV spin-offs, although I quite liked the original movie. I decided to check out the first few episodes (I exercise to them and I'm always looking for new things to keep me going). It was interesting how closely the actor cast to play Jackson (Michael Shanks) emulated the original star's (James Spader) appearance and voice--voice especially. The stories chug along at a good pace and the SFX are reasonably convincing. The fact that nearly everyone seems to speak fluent English, however, is less so. In the original film, no one could communicate until Jackson cracked the vowel shifts in the language as it had evolved on the other planet over several thousand years, and all the conversations are subtitled. SyFy obviously decided that was too laborious for a TV series, but they don't propose any alternative explanation, such as Babel fish in everybody's ears or a Universal Translator. There's also a certain inconsistency in the threats to blow up or seal off the Earth stargate portal--especially because we know it's an idle threat since if the portal is sealed, there won't be any more show.I've only watched a few episodes and there are 10 seasons of 20 episodes each, and that's just for SG-I. I'm not sure it's really caught my interest enough for me to watch all of them.	4.0	Interesting spin-off from the film	2013-02-18	0	0	0

In any event, great show -- can't wait for the other discs.

In season 1 it starts out strong and ends strong but in a bit week in the middle. It is however worth it and every season is better than the last until season 10.

Admittedly I was a bit underwhelmed at first, I would have liked a more edgy show, something more like Firefly and not Star Trek.  Still, from experience you know how it takes new shows a while to get their story line set up.  I trudged on, watched the whole season although you have to suspend disbelief at many things...i.e. they obviously shot scenes from different planets from the same location on set...the scientists in SG-1 can easily kill/fight against trained soldiers who can't seem to hit anything standing in front of them.  And when will Teal'c quit grimacing! ARgh.Richard Anderson made the show for me, so that helped each episode.  I just finished season 2 and can honestly say it is much better.  Overall, it is entertaining and interesting, with improvements as the season goes on.	4.0	Good, but gets better later on	2008-05-09	1	1	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2GST5ATWLO7NY	"J. A. Johnson ""drkangel"""	If you love Science-Fiction, or loved the feature movie that inspired this series. This box set of season one delivers the show is simply stunning. The series is classic Science Fiction with character driven stories, lite on the f/x but done extremely well, and people you care about the second you get to know them. It's rare when a series can do so much, especially when most first seasons are looked at by many critics and industry people and even writers on the show as a season of learning and growing pains. Season one is far from that. When the show started I watched all of two episodes before I called it poor and refused to watch it. In October on a trip to Vancouver I just happened to catch the last 30 minutes of a 4th season episode and got intrigued. I checked the local tv guide and saw it coming on three more times that night on three different channels with 3 different episodes. Canada loves good sci-fi, hey for a country that loves First Wave and Stargate what's not to like. Anyway, I watched all 3 episodes that night after being exhausted on a trek through the city and was totally sucked in. When I got back I caught a couple reruns and was hooked for sure. The 4th season was outstanding even though the series is highly serialized itself I was able to catch on what was happening by the end of the episodes that were referring to 3 full seasons I hadn't seen. I ordered the entire Showtime package on my dish network system to get commercial free Stargate reruns of the 4th season, two episodes back to back every friday night. Then I went ahead and ordered this box set, having seen a couple episodes that pushed me away the first time I went with it anyway cause I wanted to see if maybe I didn't give the show a real chance. After watching the 4th season I felt it was worth it. So I bought and in the last two days I have watched every single minute of the the box set. I have a long vacation and wanted to watch something aside from regular tv and just crash and relax. Needless to say I was wrong about the first season and giving it an honest chance I found the episodes compelling and while some are better than others, this season one rivals that of this last season of the show. As for the dvd's themselves. The transfers are beautiful, widescreen is better, and no commercials is a great way to be spoiled. The special features while small in number really flesh out the set. I noticed a comment in the first featurette on the second volume on how the editors had their work cut out for them from so much goofing off and stuff. Which maybe on a bonus disc or something would be great to see outtakes from each episode. I would have thought some deleted scenes might have found their way in the episodes or somewhere. With what MGM did for the set, I was pleased and impressed at the same time. Aside from the beautiful discs and trasnfers was a great season and something special to see. Even if you are reluctant to buy this set, ask anyone who bought this set if they regret buying it. Not one of them would say they are disappointed with disc that are far superior to the X-Files boxed sets except in bonus material. It'd be real nice to see what call the 007 editions of Stargate SG-1, especially with all those hours of film with outtakes on them.	5.0	A Definitive Item for the Stargate or Sci-Fi fan...	2001-05-25	5	3	2
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A9PDVJ0UBBRW8	Jake	I don't want to make this a long review, so I'll say that I've seen all the seasons of Stargate SG-1 and the first season starts ramping up really quickly.  It's definitely one of the weakest seasons of the series, but there are some great episodes in here.  The cast needs time to get to feel out their roles too, as in every show.  I think this is definitely a 4 star experience for a 5 star show.  My favorite seasons are definitely the later ones...starting at around season 5 or 6.	4.0	A Decent Start to a Great Show	2013-05-30	0	0	0

The character development, the stories, and the technologies in the later seasons where humanity starts taking to the starts themselves and not just through the Stargates.

Though I have one complaint that MGM aren't interested in responding back to me about.  Let me start by saying I'm actually British but now live in California.  Here is my reason for being upset with MGM, I am an avid collecter of sci-fi series especially this one, I already collected season one in England but ended up selling it due to my move to USA. So imagine my suprise when I found out that not even series one of Stargate had hit the shelves yet in USA. Where as in Britain they are already selling season 4 on DVD.  This is hardly fair, I often thought it's nice to buy something you've never seen before. But the way that Stargate is being released over here in the states, I will have only just bought the first couple of series before I have finished watching it on TV? This to me is ridiculous. Anyways I am looking forward to the release dates of series 2,3,4 , I just hope that the afore mentioned seasons are released more swiftly.	5.0	MGM Need To Publish Stargate Series Quicker In USA!!!!	2001-05-02	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2PBDB92U5WIJA	Janis Cortese	I've steered clear of ALL television science fiction and most movies until very recently.  &quot;Star Trek&quot; of all flavors has turned into a blazingly sexist hour-long commercial for plastic merchandise, and &quot;Babylon 5&quot; failed spectacularly to make good on its promise of a deeper, more complex storyline.  To be honest, I still avoid most television fiction; for the most part, if it's not on PBS I don't watch it.As a result, this series surprised the hell out of me.  Oh, it's got its problems -- bad science, bad Egyptology (Hathor had the head of a cow and was goddess of beauty and not festivity or intoxication, and come on, Budge's translation of the Book of the Dead is still one of the best reference books out there; who else gives the glyphs and the transliterations?), and the occasional irritating dose of sexism -- but I still was very surprised by how good it is, and I tend to be hypersensitive to that sort of stuff.The movie was such a disappointment that I expected very little from the TV show; aside from James Spader, the movie had almost nothing to recommend it.  The TV show, though, has a lot more meat on its bones.  And the cast is wonderful.  Richard Dean Anderson is very wry and grounded, Amanda Tapping is a lot more substantial than your stock inflatable-bimbo-who-tries-to-act-tough that these shows try to present as female role models, and Michael Shanks is every bit as charming as James Spader was in the same role in the movie.  Don Davis isn't a slacker, either; his General Hammond is wonderful as the military-stickler-with-a-heart-of-gold.If television science fiction has got you jaded lately with insulting storylines, sexism till you puke, and avalanches of plastic merchandise, check out these DVDs.  I've got no clue if the subsequent seasons are any good; these are the only ones I've bought.  But they're definitely worth the dough.	4.0	surprised by how good it was	2001-07-09	5	1	4

And my favorite actor-hockey nut, Richard Dean Anderson is playing a very different character, Col. O'neill.  He is sort of an old bird, not brilliant in that he is highly educated like Carter and Jackson, but he has a second sense about what is the best way to proceed under adversity.  It took me time to warm to the way the character was being played.  But the SG1 team, with addition of the alien Tilk have great adventures and make it fun at the same time.  The series for me is a great blend of action, comedy and special effects that look real.  Much of the TV show appears to filmed outside, rather than in sound studios, which adds to the realism, making this SciFi show believable.The TV series grew on me so I bought the first season to get caught up!	5.0	Just starting watching this year.

Samuels ""junesxing"""	I gave this cd only 4 stars, despite the incredible nature of the pilot (far superior to the movie), and the interesting character of the fist true episode.The reason is the last episode (the emancipation). It was quite disappointing. It reverted to an unthinking, formula plot that was totally predictable.The flaws in this show are incredibly numerous. They include a primitive warlord advocating women's rights in a society that wouldn't even let them speak in public, a totally predictable boy meets girl, boy kidnaps carter to trade for girl, Carter fights girls father for girl's freedom plot. the writers making a joke, referencing another planet, even though this was supposed to be the first planet they visited after abbadon, and by never showing the transition (which according to the overall series plot, would have been significant to the people on this planet), of explaining that they were not, as they had claimed from accross the sea, but had come through the gate. By the end of the show, the primitive people they were dealing with, just knew and understood ???I hope the rest of the first season fills the promise of the first two episodes. They, at least, were superb.	4.0	inceredible start, predictable finish	2005-09-16	8	2	6

I had watched the whole season on t.v. with my husband, and even let my kids watch some of the episodes with us. I had no reason to think that these DVDs would be any different than what I saw on t.v.  I was watching the pilot and BAM! Full on naked chick! And it wasn't just a quick blip, there was an entire 3-5 minute scene where you could see everything.  I am pretty sure I didn't order a porn.  I was quite shocked, and angry. I am keeping the series, and just not allowing my kids to watch that first episode, because all of the rest of them are the same as what I saw on t.v.	4.0	Love this series	2011-10-10	5	3	2

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1GTUYDY7NCWTA	Jeremy Bullock	This box set of Season 1 is very good. The writing on this show is superb and demonstrates the technical and scientific research that went into creating this innovative series. The actors are each brilliant in their ability to bring their characters to life, something which is rare in today's TV. Most of the episodes are individual stories, but the ongoing subplots and occasional cliffhangers allow the show to slowly evolve as the characters gain more and more knowledge of the universe. I highly recommend this set for any Sci-Fi fan. My only complaint would be a missing soundtrack element on one of the episodes from Disk 3. I don't think this my disk or player, since I returned the set and got a new one, and found two friends who have the same problem with their sets. This is a minor problem since you can still understand what is happening despite the missing dialogue (from only one character). Buy the set and you won't be disappointed.	4.0	Stargate SG-1 is consistently fresh!	2002-04-02	3	3	0

I have cable, I have showtime and never was able to keep myself home to catch an episode, actually I am lying I cought one episode. So needless to say I was blown away, this show quite possibly could be one of the best sci-fi shows on right now. It has everything, action, comedy, and adequate special effects. They seem to tie in so many ancient cultures to Goa'uld's which is very sweet, and they do it well. Very rarely will you find any holes in the story line everything ranging from ancient greek to egyptian has been tied into the Goa'uld's plot to take over the universe and enslave the human race.September is still to far away, they need to release season 2 now.	5.0	WOW! is the only term I can think of.	2002-07-29	1	1	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A25S2ROWOQXEA9	Jim Rowlen	To start, I have over 560 DVDs so I have some experience with them.  I am also a great fan of SG-1 and spend a lot of time on various SG-1 sites.First, these are ARTIFICALLY widescreen, images are stretched and you WILL see fat faces and circles, and other distortions.  While I prefer widescreen when a movie is shot that way, these were originally shot full frame and should have stayed that way.  Still, that isn't my main complaint.The company who mastered these made a number of mistakes which are reported on a number of SG-1 message boards.  In my case, starting with Broca Divide, voices are nearly inaudible unless you turn the stereo way up.  The leaves rustling in the wind are still louder than the voices.  Music and other sound effects scream and voices are barely a whisper.  Supposedly Nox and a few other episodes also have this problem (haven't viewed them yet).  Some say you can unplug one of the channels and get the voices.  Why should we have to do that?  And if you are using digital/optical sound &quot;wiring&quot; you can't do that.Another problem is that the interlaced scene transistions will frequently &quot;flash&quot; bright white with thin dark horizontal lines.  While you can ALMOST get used to this it is very annoying.These are just mastering problems and can be fixed.  I have not received a response from MGM but the store I bought them from will give me a full refund and are returning all copies FOR THEIR ENTIRE NATIONWIDE CHAIN to the distributor.When Disney had a similar problem (no voice on the right channel for &quot;The Black Hole&quot;) they issued a recall within the first week and replaced all defective copies already purchased.  It's unfortunate that MGM has apparently ignored complaints in the US and Britian concerning the sound.  I am anxiously waiting to buy all 5 season, but not until they are mastered correctly.	1.0	Serious Technical Problems With This Release	2001-06-19	63	49	14

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A33A36Y2ZH8OSX	JK	Ok, I'm going to go against the tide here and say that the full frontal nudity scene in the pilot episode was pretty much the high point of the whole thing.  I had heard good things about this show, but honestly, if this show was a book I'll bet it would have a cheeseball painting on the cover of a tough looking dude with a scar and maybe a futuristic eyepatch, a tough babe showing cleavage, and a spaceship.  Maybe a dragon, for good measure.  And some lasers.  Maybe a big, forboding claw-like hand framing the whole thing like it's getting ready to grab everyone.  Ug.Since the nudity was the only part worth watching, I will instead review that:  As nudity goes, this is classic nudity - completely gratuitous, lovingly framed, and remaining on camera far longer than is necessary.  The character in question is credited as 'Dark Skinned Woman' which is accurate, but probably should have been 'Naked Woman' since that was the only reason she was on camera.  The part required no acting skills, but it did require naked skills, and the actress portraying Dark Skinned Woman had that in spades.  If there is any justice in this world she will win an Oscar.  I don't care if this was a TV show - an Oscar I say!Yeah, so this was terrible.  Sorry to all the fans, I know you love the show, but to anyone else thinking of dipping a toe in just be aware this material falls somewhere between Doctor Who and Independence Day.  Think SciFi Channel's 'The Invisible Man' meets the original Star Trek.  Nothing wrong with that per se, but yeah.	2.0	Awww yeah	2007-05-25	18	5	13
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AIT001NGNLK8H	"jkw ""mom of 3"""	The rest of the season, might be ok to watch as a family, but NOT the pilot.  What is the deal with Hollywood ruining a perfectly good show with nudity?  The pilot has quite a LONG scene that shows full nudity for quite a while.  I fast forwarded it as long as I could, and had to turn it off.  It was too much to see, even with the DVD player going in fast forward.  Give me a break!  All the reviews say Not Rated, with no idication of any other ratings.  But if you look at the back of that disc case, once you get it home after buying it, it says rated R for nudity.  I don't think people should be surprised with that content being in the movie.  Why don't the websites say that in their reviews, so parents can know what they are bringing into their home.  I will not keep something that filthy in my home, and am sure other parents wouldn't want it either.	2.0	Not family television...	2006-07-28	58	11	47
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3GG7QSSI58HJV	J. Lail	I had this question about the packaging but it has since been answered. Thanks.________________Does anyone know why these seasons look different from the older packaging? And why are they so cheap?I have all ten seasons that I purchased a few years ago. The first eight seasons came with five separate DVD boxes in each boxed set. The 9th and 10th season were the slim packs.The boxes now being offered for $10 look nothing like the ones I bought. I was looking to get the first 8 seasons in the slim packs because the older ones I have take up so much room.What is the deal with these sets?Why so inexpensive?Why do they look different?Are the DVDs of a cheaper quality than the older sets were?Any help would be appreciated.________________I started watching Stargate SG-1 after it got to Sci-Fi. I never knew it existed until then. One episode is all it too to make me a fan. I got caught up on all the episodes and never missed another until the end. I am not ashamed to say that I even got misty eyed during the last episode. I didn't want to see it end.If there is anyone out there who has not see this series, you don't know what you are missing. Sure, it is more of the same week after week, but they manage to pull it off.I was disappointed when Jack left the show, and it took me a few episodes to get used to the new lineup, but I did and life went on. The edition of the new characters made for some interesting plot twists.One episode that I wish had never aired was the one where the doctor was killed. She was a cutie.Since I bought the entire Stargate series, I have already watched it twice. I suppose that it all comes down to what you like. I like Sci-Fi and Stargate SG-1 just caused something to click in my brain. I wish they would make another movie or two and include Jack.I currently only have three full series on my DVD shelves: Stargate SG-1  -  South Park  -  and Boston Legal.	5.0	Best Sci-Fi Series Ever	2010-11-25	1	0	1

Star Trek had some good stuff (but with too much PC) every once in a while, but evolved into a PC re-education gulag for mindless sheep. SG-1 has all the PC and none of the creativity.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1ZHHTDET5MTMC	Jody Davies	Anyone who has not seen this series is missing alot of new ideas, plots and fantastic acting. Stargate SG-1 has a tremendous amount of ideas, special effects and humor at times that has kept me laughing for days. Richard Dean Anderson (Col. ONeill)as the leader of SG-1 has the best suttle features on his face, Michael Shanks as Daniel Jackson brings a navitity that melts your heart, Amanda Tapping as Sam Carter brings in the technical aspect for those who really like the technobabble; Chris Judge as Teal'c make you wonder how he can stand the human race at times, and finally Davis as Hammond, you just know he's in charge but cares deeply for all his SG teams.There is no way you say that a 45 minute show can have a completed script that makes sense, or acting that makes you care what happens to the characters, or carry a theme that makes you look forward to the next show. However, I must say, if you have not watched SG-1, you are missing out on a really good series that I believe will last as long as (probably longer) than Star Trek has. It has everything a show should have including common sense. Sex isn't used because the writer couldn't think of what to do next, the nice part is that it isn't that kind of show and I believe that is one of the reasons for its popularity. You can allow young children to watch without worry about what they will be learning. The majority of the series episodes keep you on the edge of your seat or laughing out loud. One thing is for sure, you will watch the show over and over again. It's a purchase worth the money. There are web sites popping up all over the place, but Showtime still connects the best of the SGC.	5.0	Stargate Possibilities	2002-03-18	6	5	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AQBRMBQ99ESI7	"John A Lee III ""jal3"""	"The movie STARGATE was a fascinating piece of speculative fiction with an exciting story and lots of interest. The TV series does not live up to the same standard but it is not for lack of trying. The studios went all out with series in an effort to make it appealing to the eyes and to the mind. The costumes are not as good as those from the movie but they are certainly good enough. About the most unbelievable part about the series is the way that just about everyone they run into speaks English. Still, it is a fun series to watch.Synopses of the episodes appear below:Children of the Gods - This was the pilot episode. About a year after the mission to Abydos (Stargate Movie), the people of Earth believe that they are safe and that the stargate was sealed at the far end. They were wrong. They learn this when the gate opens and a group of marauders comes through, killing some of the guards and kidnapping another one. To deal with this situation, Col. Jack O'Neill is called out of retirement again. He leads a mission back to Abydos to learn what happened and where the marauders came from. One of them seems an awful lot like Ra, killed at the end of the movie. The reconnaissance reveals that the doc is still alive and well but that the stargates lead to many more destinations. One of these destinations is the source of the raiders. It seems that they have a penchant for kidnapping people to use as the host for the larval stage of the ""gods"". A new task force is put together to provide stargate security and to try and learn more. Another, unofficial mission will be to rescue the doc's wife, taken as a host for one of the parasites.The Enemy Within - As the team made its exit from the hostile firefight at the end of the pilot episode, Maj. Kowalski was infected with one of the creatures. This episode is concerned primarily with how the parasite can be removed. The parasite, however, has its own plans. It wants to get home and doesn't care who gets killed...the more the merrier. Just as important to the story line for the series as a whole is how the defector should be treated. Some want to add him to the team and others want to study him in a lab. It is he, though, who will save the day.Emancipation - An expedition makes its way to a planet populated by Mongols a la Genghis Khan. Fortunately, they all speak English so the show is easy to follow. It turns out that these Mongols were seeded on the planet by the same race that likes to use humans as incubators for their young. Because of this, the culture has changed some. Women are property and are not allowed to speak unless spoken to in the hope that this will help hide them from the aliens. It is death to show their face in public. The expedition happily first encounters a fairly progressive clan who actually try to be nice to their women in a male chauvinist sort of way. It looks like things are going well until the blonde captain Carter is kidnapped by the chieftain's son. He doesn't want her for himself; instead, he wants to trade her to a rival chieftain for a bride.  From there, things start to spiral downward until it looks like a war between the clans. It will take a round of hand to hand combat to resolve things and, perhaps, bring about a Mongol Equal Rights Amendment.The Broca Divide - The team from SG1 visits a strange planet. There seems to be the remnants of a Minoan civilization but there also seems to be a primitive society without any type of civilization at all. What seems to be completely missing is any sign of the BAD GUYS or any threat. The team manages to stick around long enough to learn that the primitives or ""touched"" as they are called are actually members of the more advanced civilization as well but they have been touched by members of ""the touched"". After that, some of them become ""the touched"" and others do not. It is all very interesting but doesn't seem to bear on the mission at hand so they return to base. In the middle of the debrief, though, members of the team start going crazy. It affects some, but not all. It seems there is some fast acting virus and that the clue to the cure lies back on the planet.The First Commandment - When the SG9 team becomes overdue, the SG1 team is sent looking for them and they expect the worse. They do not find the ghoulish aliens posing as gods; instead, they find the leader of the SG1 team posing as a god. He has promised to protect the people of the planet from their hellish sun in exchange for a few simple things like unquestioning obedience, labor, undying devotion and, presumably, the occasional nubile maiden. He has deeper plans, however. He has expected SG1 to be sent to investigate and he is counting on Capt. Clark, his former lover, to get an alien artifact working.Brief Candle - The SG1 teams investigates a new planet with a vaguely Greek culture. It seems like a paradise but there is something amiss. Everyone seems too happy, young and playful. Nobody gets any work done. They just enjoy themselves and mysteriously fall asleep each night. No force can wake them. The colonel manages to get himself accidentally married to one of the local girls and then he becomes susceptible to the sleep disorder as well. More than that, he begins aging at an incredible rate. It turns out that the locals were originally an experimental population for the ghouls. They have been infected with a bit of nano technology to accelerate their aging process and each is allotted 100 days to live. They are born, get old and die in that span of time. Now the colonel is racing to catch up with them and he is already well over a hundred days old.Cold Lazarus - This one strains the bounds of credibility more than most. The SG1 team explores a new planet but this one seems to be without life. Instead, they find only a bunch of blue crystals. When Col. O'Neill examines one too closely, he gets blasted unconscious. Then a replica of the colonel goes back with the team, goes AWOL and seeks out the colonel's family. He has a strange mission having to do with their dead child. When the real colonel shows up back at the HQ, a manhunt ensues in order to locate him. No one wants to harm anyone else but there are unintended consequences.Thor's Hammer - The SG1 team hypothesizes that there is another race out there which is advanced as the ghouls but which is benevolent. Their clues lead them back to the Norse myths and, particularly, Thor and his hammer. Teal'c recognizes the sign of the hammer and even has a set of stargate coordinates associated with it. They make the trip and find a world of humans with Norse culture and who venerate Thor as their great benefactor. As soon as they come through, though, they are examined by a mysterious ray and Teal'c is affected by it, Col O'Neill gets caught up in it also when he tries to help and the two of them are whisked off to a quarantine area to cleanse those infected with the parasites. This gives hope to the doc that there is a way to save his wife but he must make some tough choices.The Torment of Tantalus - While reviewing some old records, Daniel learns that the military managed to activate the stargate back in 1945. A single traveler went through and was never heard from again. That traveler was the fianc&eacute; of one of the original researchers. Records also indicate that the gate opens on a location that is unknown to the ghouls. A reconnaissance is organized along with a rescue expedition, just in case the traveler is still alive. The team makes it through, finds the man isolate for 50 years and then discovers that the gate at the other end is broken. It's a long walk home.Bloodlines - After some exploratory surgery intended to see if the ghoul parasite can be removed from Teal'c, we learn that he has a wife and son back on his home planet. We further learn that he is scheduled to be infected with a parasite in just a few days. He resolves to go back and rescue them. Since the SG high command will have a lot of trouble stopping him, they decide to make a mission out of it. Finding the wife and son turns out to be relatively easy. Convincing them that returning to earth is a good idea is harder. Getting through the security arrangements is toughest of all...until some difficult choices have to be made.Fire and Water - Shortly after the SG1 team departs on a mission, three survivors struggle back through the gate. Daniel was killed in a volcano and the team is mourning him. They have a difficult time coming to terms with his death but something strikes them all as being wrong. They keep having flashbacks. It turns out that they are having false memories of his death, implanted by an alien who wanted to keep Daniel. He values his historical knowledge and wants to find out what happened to his wife...in ancient Babylon.The Nox - A government bureaucrat inspected the stargate facility expresses his disappointment that the return on investment for the stargate program is not sufficient and threatens to shut it down. When Teal'c mentions a planet with an invisible hummingbird (with big teeth) they figure that capturing one and learning about invisibility would be a useful stunt and keep the program going. When they arrive at the planet, though, the find that the ghouls are there hunting the same bird. They also encounter a race of beings that seems like a cross between flower children, elves and certain varieties of hippies. When the team is killed by the ghouls, the Nox (elvish beings) bring them back to life. They also restore one of the ghoul carriers and therein lies the problem. The Nox refuse to allow the capture of detainment of the carrier so the SG1 team is afraid that he will bring the ghouls back to hunt these beings. They want to help and defend them but the elves will abide no violence, even in their defense. That sets the situation up for a conflict of missions, loyalties and right and wrong.Hathor - An archeological team investigating a pyramid in Mexico finds an Egyptian sarcophagus and is then mysteriously killed. When the SG1 team investigates, a woman who knows all about the stargate shows up and claims to be the Egyptian fertility goddess, Hathor. She is possessed by one of the ghouls but she does have a way with men. She seems glad to learn of Ra's death and worms her way into control of the Stargate facility. Men are affected, by Capt. Clark is not. It turns out that she has her own nefarious plans.Cor-Ai - When the SG1 team visits a new world, Teal'c reveals that he has been there before and that the planet is one where the ghouls often go to recruit hosts. What is worse, when the natives show up, they recognize Teal'c as the man who killed one of their fathers. They capture him and put him on trial for his crimes. The SG1 team acts as his defense counsel but the fix is in. The judge is the son of the slain man. Things are not as simple as they seem. Teal'c had a reason for killing the man. His actions likely saved many of the villagers but getting them to understand that is difficult. Things get worse when the politicians back home refuse to mount a rescue expedition.Singularity - The SG1 teams heads for a planet to watch an eclipse of a black hole. When they get there, they find everyone including the SG7 team dead of some sort of plague. Quarantine procedures are put into effect and then the SG1 team finds a single survivor, a young girl. She is taken back through the gate to earth and is found to have a mysterious immunity. It seems to be conferred by the same element from which the stargate is made and which is floating around in her blood. Capt. Clark immediately goes into ""protective mommy"" mode and the rest of the crew gets just about as protective. They all get worried when she gets sick. Closer examination reveal an alien artifact made of the same mineral lodged near her heart. The problem is that it is decaying and Teal'c recognizes it as a bomb to destroy the stargate. Observation reveals a ghoul ship hovering over the planet waiting to see the stargate destroyed. Everyone is horrified when they realize that all the people killed by the plague on the planet and the little girl serving as a human nuclear bomb are just part of a plot to destroy the earth's gate. To make matters worse, it looks like the girl is going to explode on schedule. If this episode does not set off protective parental instincts, you should avoid being around children...any children.Enigma - The SG1 team arrives on a planet in the midst of volcanic convulsions. They are about ready to bug out when they notice human bodies lying about. Some of the bodies are alive and a rescue is effected. They are surprised to learn that the survivors are not all that pleased to be rescued. It turns out that they have stumbled upon a team from an advanced civilization. They are very reticent to answer any questions about themselves or their culture. This is for the protection of lesser civilizations. Meanwhile, a power mad intelligence type wants to keep the refugees as prisoners in the hope that they might provide technological advancements. The situation is complicated when one of the refugees falls for Capt. Clark.Tin Man - The team arrives on a technologically advance but seemingly deserted planet. After they encounter a strange beam of light, a crazy old man shows up. He seems very glad to see them. He might well be since he has been alone for 11,000 years. Though he is happy with their presence, he won't answer their questions. Seeming to have nothing further to gain, they leave for home. When they return home, the medical exam reveals something strange. They are all androids. Everyone freaks out. Eventually, they do return only to find that the crazy old man had replicated them in order to have some company and help in maintaining the place. Oh...and they can't go home and survive.Solitudes - Not long after leaving for a new planet, the team comes stumbling back. They have been in a firefight and have just barely made it. More accurately, some of them made it. Daniel and Teal'c came through but the colonel and the captain are missing. It seems that they are stranded on an ice planet, wounded and short on supplies. Power got interrupted on their transit and they wound up somewhere else. It turns out they are much closer than everyone assumes but it is a matter of time before time runs out.There But for the Grace of God - The SG1 team pops into a fairly highly advanced world that is deserted. Teal'c finds a sign that the ghouls have destroyed this world and irradiated it making it dangerous to stay. The Colonel tells everyone to saddle up and head home but Daniel is busy meddling with some artifacts and touches something that causes a slight shock. When he heads back for the stargate, everyone is missing. He dials home himself, returns to Earth and finds things very strange. He is not recognized and the Earth is currently under attack by ghoul forces. They are systematically destroying all resistance and there is not much they can do to stop them. He has stumbled into an alternate reality. Daniel has some information that may save his version of earth. To do so, however, this version of the colonel (a general) will have to do some powerful negotiating with the commander of the ghoul forces...Teal'c.Politics - This one is a retrospective episode. The only significant new part of the story is Daniel's return from the last episode. He bears dire warnings of an imminent invasion but nobody believes him. They are also distracted by a senator who wants to cut the SG budget. He holds some secret hearings so that he can shut down the program. He doesn't believe there is any threat and the episode is mostly taken up by flashbacks from previous episodes.Within the Serpent's Grasp - The season finale is cliffhanger. Stargate Command is about to be shut down in a few days due to political buffoonery. Daniel's warning that the ghoul attack fleet is on the way goes unheeded. The SG1 team decides to take unauthorized action. They use the coordinates brought back by Daniel a few episodes back and find themselves aboard a ghoul ship. It is one of the ships heading for earth. As the season closes, the fate of Earth is in the balance."	4.0	A Good Sci-Fi Series	2005-12-31	6	4	2

Sad huh?Anyway, I got hold of this Boxed Set a while back (during Exams actually, a good idea... no study!) as it was the only way to get the Season 1 eps on DVD (I had most of Season 2, but wanted Season 1).Anyway, these DVD's are excellent. A few of the eps are out of order (usually by one though ie. Ep 11 is really Ep 10 and so on) and there are a few that are totally out of order (Ep 12 is NOT The Nox, The Nox is Ep 7 in the series).The quality is amazing, WIDE SCREEN RULES and the sound is great.

Then there is the only the whole Idea that a race of people who are at a level of tech like the Roman would be if they attacked the USA would have a chance of putting up a fight is WAY out there and the whole idea of the black side-kick who leaves his people to fight the bad black guys who all later in the show all tend to be white even though most are from Egypt is kind of insulting. I don't even know where they get the idea the Neanderthals where the dominant race of humans on this planet that is just down right dumb.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3FEJ8H2VTN0OJ	john ziesemer	Star Trek in the '60s opened up our minds to space travel and exploration. StarWars in the late '70s reopened the door to more travel and raised the bar for FX. America couldn't get enough at the theaters and on their TV sets & VCRs. Then came along a movie called STARGATE. WOW. When the series started nobody had any idea as to the following it would garner. The primary catalyst to the series is Egyptology, but there are so many old civilizations and religions across the world that share the &#34;same&#34; context of the flood and &#34;chariots of the Gods&#34; and some of these are interwoven into the episodes. The battle to rule the entire galaxy. And there is only one team to fight for humanity. You just gotta watch it to know what I mean....

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3F3J9XV1NVOSP	Jordan Roberts	Stargate: SG-1 and the entire Stargate franchise has to be one of my favorite Sci-Fi shows of all time. And probably one of the most prolific outside of Star Trek. It's amazing, worth every second, and unforgettable. A must see.	5.0	Brilliant	2013-02-10	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A5H8VLE7L7SB	Jose	With amazing sound, storys and visual efects, Stargate has become one of most interesting TV cults.  It opens with an excelent first season. The episodes are a great combination of science and mithology. The stories are well adapted, with a good development of the characters through the series and excellent quality. Episodes such as Children of the Gods, The Enemy Within, The Nox, Thor`s Hammer, The Torment of Tantalus, Fire and Water, Hathor, There But For the Grace of God, and Within the Serpent's Grasp are shocking. The villains are great, although Apophis is defeated so many times, (reason why villains lose fans), his faliures in this season will lead to the opportunity to rule the largest military empire in the galaxy, (so do not laugh at him). Few series have begun with such a strong season. Won't regret it, buy it right now.	5.0	Stargate SG-1 First Season	2001-03-24	24	19	5

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1Z6BNAII904GF	J.P. Sallup	Stargate Sg-1 is one of the greatest Sci-fi series of the past 5 years. Each episode is very interesting and exciting. Even if you don't like sci-fi I will guarantee you will enjoy Stargate Sg-1.You should buy this boxed set, it is a great a value. You get 5 DVD's and you also get over 1000 minutes of viewing time.Yes, it is true there are some errors in some of the DVD's. But who cares if an episode is out of order, you can still see it, can't you? And I haven't noticed any of the visual or audio technical difficulties mentioned by other reviewers making the errors I've seen minor.Buy this set, you'll have hours of excitement for a great value.	5.0	A Great Boxed Set!!!	2001-07-17	5	5	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2JJVZYN8T9TI8	J & R Kirkland, WA	I agree with what another viewer said about recommending Stargate SG-1.  I am NOT a Sci-Fi fan in general.  I did not care much for Star Wars and I really disliked Star Trek; however, I loved Stargate SG-1!  As a side note, I also did NOT care much for Stargate Atlantis from the episodes I saw on t.v.  We purchased the first 6 plus seasons Stargate SG-1 some years back and I still enjoy watching them again and again.BETTER THAN T.V. - When I watched Stargate on t.v. I would miss an episode here and there and to be able to watch them in order is a plus because it adds to the enjoyment.  You can watch isolated episodes, but, the episodes do build somewhat upon each other.  I caution you though that it is so enjoyable that you may sit down to watch one episode and keep watching.ADULT THEMES - There is nudity in Season 1 (First or Second Show), but, I do not remember nudity in other shows?  The women are sometimes dressed Sexy. The show has many battles, but, my stomach could handle the scenes they showed.  I think they did an excellent job of conveying battle without showing bloody scenes.ACTING - All of the acting is top notch.  The characters have debth.  I think most people will identify with at least one of the main characters in some ways.  The show is centered around four warriors.  The four warriors probably would not have chosen each other as friends because they are so different, but, their differences are also their strengths.  Sometimes their surrival was the result of their differences.  The warriors are true friends and they respect one another.  I would say the true purpose of the warriors is to seek truth and freedom.MATURE SUBJECT MATTER - I wouldn't expect young children to be enjoying this show.  The show has mature subject matter including slavery, sexual stereoytypes, equality, greed, oppression, Dangers of knowledge and Power and Dangers of Lacking in Knowledge and Power, False Idols, Mythology and lots of bibical symbolism to name a few.  It is good versus evil, but, oftentimes it is difficult to determine what is good and what is evil when you are in the midst of the situation as the warriors are.  The show also illustrates our human nature and experiences which can be positive at times and uplifting and negative at times and heartbreaking.CONCLUSION - The show can be deep and thought provoking or just pure entertainment, depending on your desire.  I appreciate having t.v. shows that have debth and excellent writing, acting, scenery.  This show has drama, humor, love and action.  It doesn't get much better than Stargate SG-1.	5.0	NOT a Sci-Fi Fan	2008-12-14	3	2	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1NA5BWQ7Z1UPZ	J. Shrewsbury	The concept of Stargate SG-1 is unique (notwithstanding the movie on which it was based) in the Sci-Fi genre. I love that they can laugh at themselves and at their genre, and still be taken seriously as a series and storyline. Season 1 gets off to a slow start. It reminds me of the hokey original Star Trek series. But about halfway through the first season it is clear that something changed and the stories improved significantly. Maybe the characters began to develop or maybe the writers were simply threatened with being fired. But by the time the first season ends, the viewer is hooked.	5.0	Great Start to a Great Series	2013-08-11	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ADAYUQBAR4LGQ	"June Enger ""anawim4"""	This box set makes you crave more.  I can hardly wait until the Season 2 Box Set is released Sept 3/02.  I first viewed the movie 'Stargate' while visiting my daughter &amp; her family in Middleburg, VA &amp; needless to say it wet my appetite for more.  Then the series followed during my stay.  What a boon it was to see the story continue.Now after purchasing &amp; owning the Season 1 Box Set, I can hardly wait to acquire the entire collection.  I hope that each season will follow, otherwise I will be greatly disappointed.  What has compelled me to do so, besides being a SciFi viewer is once there was a show called 'Max Headroom' with Michael Fruer.  The show was excellent &amp; I looked forward to seeing it weekly.  It also would wet a person's appetite to see more.  Then the series ended &amp; that, like they say was that.  I do not want to experience that disappointment with Stargate.  As years go by &amp; the series ends, hopefully I will have my collection that I will be able to view whenever I want.If you ever consider a SciFi collection, definitely consider 'STARGATE'.  The action is steady, the performers were well chosen (thank you to whoever selected them), &amp; the story lines are unique.  Richard Dean Anderson's wit continues in this series, he is an unbelievable performer, not to mention, 'what a honey'.  But then he isn't alone, both Michael Shanks &amp; Christopher Judge are not only remarkable actors in their own right, but when they smile, 'mmm mmm good'.  Then there is Amanda Tapping, what can I say, she presents an excellent character, brains &amp; courage wrapped up in humour.  I would love to see her counter to O'Neil be more developed in the series.Well I can't say anymore without being corny about it.  Like they say in show biz &quot;That, that's all folks&quot;.	5.0	Puts many action shows to shame.	2002-06-30	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A6H43G2YMZ573	"Juniper ""juniper66"""	I would have to say that Stargate Sg-1 is my absolute favorite tv show. They have brought the right actors together to form the SG-1. To me, Colonel O'Neill (that's 2 &quot;L's&quot;) makes the show with his one-liners and his pretending to be dumber than he actually is. Samantha Carter is the dreaded scientist that Colonel O'Neill does grow to love. She's the brain behind the team. Daniel Jackson, he's the compassionate archeologist who never leads the team astray and always seems to get his way in diplomatic matters. Teal'c, well he's Teal'c. The strong Jafar. The one who is still trying to understand O'Neill's love of fishing and his everlasting cliches. Someone who I would love to have in my corner during a fight! :)All in all, this show has suspense, surprises and quite a few cliches and laughs. You would not be disappointed watching this show. Enjoy! :)	5.0	Still and always will be a Stargate fan....	2004-01-30	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AIIIA32OYJ3MP	Jurevicious	Although the premise of this show is great, the script writing and acting is only so-so.  Unfortunately, the series never quite lives up to the potential of the idea.  However, if you can get through season one, it does get better with each year.  Initially, the cheesy script is comically bad, but if you're a true sci-fi geek, you can probably tolerate that just long enough to become invested in at least one or two of the characters.When they aren't trying to be funny and when they aren't laying it all out for the less intelligent viewing audience, the stories aren't too bad.  During the first season, you'll be amazed they were able to continue for so many seasons, but by the time you finish the last season, you'll wonder what your TV life will be like without Jack cracking sarcastic insults and T'ok raising his eyebrow.Give it a shot.

I'm glad to see that they are finally available...based on my initial inspection of the DVDs they seem to be put together quite well... I highly recommend this to any and all who love the series... I've had season 1 on tape since the beginning and it's wonderful to have them on DVD now... it's great to have them now in widescreen - that's key...unfortunately, though, I can't say ALL good things about this release... I am somewhat disappointed that the audio tracks aren't Dolby Digital 5.1; given that Farscape's DVDs are, it would have been nice to have this release in it too (especially since the flying MGM logo is in 5.1 - go figure!) In addition, the picture quality is somewhat less than perfect DVD quality, though it is fine during playback...Overall - an excellent buy for any fan... don't let my disappointments stop you - I'm quite pleased... now, on to the 2nd season and beyond!!	4.0	An excellent DVD release!	2001-05-23	4	2	2

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2GNDRD56HYE40	"Kevin Krause ""Kevin"""	I'm such a Stargate fan!  I love SG-1 and Stargate Universe, Stargate Atlantis, all of those types of shows are so much fun.  This first season of Stargate they are really developing the plot line, character development, toying around with concepts and ideas.  So it's not THEE best representation of the show.  And so maybe I shouldn't give it 5 stars, really, but I think that the rest of the seasons of the show make up for it.  In my opinion the show doesn't really take off until half way through Season 2.  But once it does it's a real joy ride!  I LOVE the different plots, story lines and concepts they introduce.  It's such great entertainment!  Totally recommend it to everyone out there!	5.0	Season 1 isn't AWESOME, but the rest of the seasons really make up for it!!	2013-10-14	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A5YSAONJ07GAD	"Kevin Tumlinson ""Wordslinger"""	"I think most people are like me when it comes to sci-fi TV. We've all been frustrated when Captain Janeway picks up a piece of alien technology in one episode but completely forgets that it exists by the next.  We get seriously ticked when an old alien nemesis suddenly becomes best buddies with our heroes.  And we can't stand to see the same over-used plot rehashed once again without at least an attempt to ""freshen it up a bit.""So when Stargate: SG-1 was first introduced, I approached it with caution.  After all, I had liked the movie (liked, mind you, not loved), but I couldn't see how anyone would be able to make it into an ongoing series.  But by the end of the pilot episode -- well, let's just say I was one slack-jawed, remote control dropping sci-fi monkey.I think the big secret is the fact that they have broken all of the old sci-fi rules.  This series does what I've always wished every other series would do.  For example, let's just take a look at alien weaponry, shall we?  In a series like ""Star Trek:Voyager,"" for example, the crew might find just the ticket for their attacking-alien woes when they run across some piece of alien weaponry.  Fine and dandy -- but before the end of the season they'll run across a half dozen other threats where that same weapon would do wonders and no one will even think to mention it.  Come on!  At least give me Chakotay scratching his head and saying, ""That alien doo-hickey we used to defeat the Borg would sure come in handy right about now.""In SG-1, there are at least half a dozen alien toys that get used in nearly every episode.  The ever popular Zat gun, for example, was found somewhere along the way and, though hastily explained, became a mainstay of the show.  Nifty.  And not just for one episode or one season, but for the full run of the show!And if the SG-1 team makes a new friend, count on seeing them again down the road.  That's just the kind of universe they live in.The big difference between the series and the film is the fact that we get to know the characters.  We get to like them.  I mean, who could like the hard-as-stone O'Neil played by Kurt Russell better than the wise-cracking, laugh-in-the-face-of-danger O'Neill from the series?  Maybe it's just me, but I crack up all the time from some little quip by O'Neil.  That's the kind of TV that brings me back every week.Buy this set.  Buy the next one.  And the next one, and the next one.  Buy all of 'em, because they're worth it.  I've bought the three sets that are currently available and will definitely buy season 4 when it comes out.  They may not be packed with extras, but they are exactly what I've been looking for.  This is Sci-fi the way I've always wanted it."	5.0	Sci-fi the way you always wanted it	2003-07-21	7	7	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3V1ZKT0UVEMWT	K. Roberts	Stargate SG-1 has become my favorite tv show. This new thinpak makes it easier to store several seasons worth of STG in a smaller space. I first borrowed my brother's copies of season 1-7 and it took up a lot of room and when I saw that a thinkpak would be sold and that it would be a tad bit cheaper, I jumped at the chance to start my collection. This show is science fiction at its best and is much better then the 'new' BattleStar Galactica (I myself prefer the original). The adventures 'off-world' are most entertaining and adventurous. I find that my favorite charcter is not one of the main one but is Dr. Frazier, the base doctor. I'm not sure what makes me like her character more then the others.  In any case, I'm enjoying the start to my collection. Try one and you'll see that you'll get hooked just as easily.	5.0	Zippin thru the galaxy	2007-01-06	4	1	3

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A26445I3Q9KL8T	"K. Weld ""Kaltros, Bandit King and General Nui..."	Having watched only a few episodes prior to getting the first season box set, I wasn't entirely sure that I would enjoy the show. But I tend to make big jumps based on intuition, and Stargate: SG1 looked very promising.What I found: The shows themselves are entertaining, although the first few episodes have some rough moments. Mostly, those are linked to Captain Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) trying to &quot;correct&quot; the behavior of a given society. Colonel O'Neill (Richard Anderson) is a good balance-point for the scientists, giving a more pragmatic view of things. His sarcastic comments lighten a lot of tension, and create a pretty enjoyable humor thread that Jackson (Shanks) can play off of. Teal'c (Christopher Judge), an honored warrior for the enemy Guaould (spelling?), is impressive. For a guy wearing mascara, he does a remarkable job of being both formidable and remote when appropriate. When called upon to play an emotional scene, however, Christopher Judge is amazingly convincing. And few people have played the warrior character as well. General Hammond (Don. S. Davis) is a fantastic counter-balance to the maverick attitudes of O'Neill and the rest of SG1. His observations about orders and duty are the reminders of what the goal of SG1 is supposed to be, and still he maintains a commander's loyalty to his teams. He's a great character, and vastly under-used, in my opinion.The stories: Variations on a theme, of course. Star Trek well-explored the elements of contacting alien races, and Stargate: SG1 has not much room left to play that angle. I must note that their tones and moods are usually quite different than Star Trek (any of them) tended to be, and that's interesting (there are times, however, where either you or your co-watchers will want to scream at the SG-1team, and sit them in front of a Trek marathon. Should be a part of their training...). The distinction is in how the show relates to Earth and it's various pantheons. In the first season, the writers touch upon Greek, Norse (Asatru) and, of course, Egyptian pantheons in what I thought were some interesting ways.The DVDs: Well, the first one of the series was damaged on the last episode, and I can't return the one without sending the whole lot back. But the rest have been fine, and the sound and visual clarity are excellent. Of course. We as consumers expect no less these days. But I thought I'd mention it.Warning: Box set ends with the season, and that's a cliff-hangar. If waiting makes your stomach tense, your knuckles ache and your eyes melt, wait until they release season two (Hurry up! Hurry... up!!). Otherwise, grab your sci-fi friends and/or your significant other, curl up, and prepare to be entertained.	4.0	Yeah, it's really THAT da##ed good.	2001-10-30	1	1	0

And seeing the change of O'Neill being played by Richard Dean Anderson, and Daniel being played by Michael Shanks is so smooth you don't even notice that it is different actors from the movie.If you have never seen the movie or series I suggest you watch the movie first and then the series you'll be happy you did.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A5LBQ00G36RF8	"L. Bridgman ""technogeek"""	I got interested in SG Universe first and absolutely loved it.  Then I watched SG Atlantis and at first thought it was not as well done as SGU, but still worth watching.  It got off too a slow start in the first couple episodes but finished very strong and is now one of my favorite series ever.  One season (3) was not up to par as far as I am concerned, but ll things considered Id have rather watched it than had no SGA to watch at all.  Season 4 was stellar (pun intended).Prior to watching SG-1 I was full of high expectations.  Not only was SG-1 the &#34;original&#34; and therefore probably even best SG series, it also had plenty of seasons to give me many many hours of viewing pleasure.  I was sorely disappointed from the very start.  I even allowed for the age/technologiy differences and did not expect special effects to be all that great - which they weren't, but I'm a big RDA fan and looked forward to seeing him in a new, non-MacGyver role.  After slogging through the first season, my opinion is that the writers just weren't as good on SG-1 S1 as any other season for the other franchises.  Even my least fav season on SGA was better than SG-1, S1.  There have been a few bright spots here and there in some of the plot lines, and I still have hopes that S2 will start to deliver better goods.  I figure a show that ran that long had to have gotten good at some point!  In addition to the poor plot lines, I also think the acting is not as great as the other shows.  Even RDA let me down.  Or at least his portral of Col. ONeal's character is too stilted and flat for my taste.  I didn't expect him to be MacGyver, but I expected him to have some type of humor to him...pretty much not.  Oh well, it's good enough that I've kept watching, but I no longer look forward to my SG time.  Perhaps things will pick up in season 2.  Got my fingers crossed!	3.0	Sometimes the first isn't the best.	2013-05-04	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1WRXACOKPITBQ	"Leiah ""So, I Read This Book Today . . ."""	I love science fiction. Babylon 5, Deep Space 9, Star Trek (all iterations after the original) and others.  Stargate is another in a long line of exceptional television of the genre. The art is very well done, and the cast is very well chosen.  But what I liked the most was the story lines. The writers developed a tight storyline that they followed better than many others, of any genre.It is a shame there isn't more great television like this. With the overabundance of so-called &#34;reality&#34; television that the SciFi channel has fallen into, I no longer watch the station. What a shame that they, like other stations, are catering to the lowest common denominator.	5.0	Great science fiction	2013-08-30	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A11ED8O95W2103	"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2"""	"It took me six years to become a fan of this show because I didn't like the movie, and I watched what were probably some of the weaker episodes on TV.  Also, the Stargate series began when Babylon-5 was really hitting its stride, and at that time I thought Stargate was a ""nice try"" also-ran compared to Bab-5.If that weren't enough, Col. O'Neill just seemed to walk around with a stupid look on his face, breaking the monotony every now and then with a wise-crack that might or might not be funny.  And, it seemed that all the planets they visited looked like the Pacific Northwest of the USA, which is where I live.  (I believe the series is filmed in or near Vancouver BC.)  Those alien worlds they kept visiting looked like my back yard.Then just this year I saw a particular episode on TV which really impressed me.  This was the ""groundhog day"" episode that dealt with losing a loved one, something I had watched my wife go through a few years ago.  I thought it was well written, and the end particularly moving.Also, it's now 2003.  Babylon-5 is over.  Enterprise is typically good only for putting me to sleep.  It seems most new sci-fi these days is about chasing aliens, bugs and critters around Earth, not going to other worlds.  There's not much of what I consider ""epic"" sci-fi out there.  (Oh yeah, Farscape started out brilliantly but by season two had brought sexual themes into the show in a particularly crass way that I found downright insulting.)So I gave Stargate another chance and bought these DVDs.I have to say that my first impressions were wrong.  This series is ""epic"" in the tradition of Star Trek (when it was a new thing), Babylon-5, The Time Tunnel, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, etc.I've gotten to know the characters, and most importantly I've watched the series in chronological order, which really helps because the episodes build on each other and serve to advance a story-arc that runs through the entire series.  DVD quality and the lack of commercials add greatly to the enjoyment.Many of the planets the SG-1 team visit still look like where I live.  Perhaps that's what the residents of Southern California thought when they watched Star Trek back in the 1960's.  It's OK.  It's great entertainment.Finally, this is a show that, with the possible exception of the needlessly gross nude scene in the pilot, you can watch with your kids.  The characters are professionals who stand for high morals and principals, and are really ""heros"", another characteristic of what I call ""epic"" science fiction."	5.0	First impressions are sometimes dead wrong.	2003-04-15	9	5	4

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A26C3MOOMWR79X	"""lms688"""	As I write this, I'm astonished by all the negative reviews for this box set. Sure, season 1 isn't SG1's best season, but its still a terrific series overall. Very intelligent writing, and one of the few shows to actually do the military correctly.An improvement on the movie, at the very least. Richard Dean Anderson rocks as Jack O'Niell, to the point where I really can't see Kurt Russel in the role without thinking it seems wrong somehow. And Micheal Shanks portrays a great Daniel Jackson.Despite having its share of dodgy episodes, this is a phenomenal price for the season. I'd pay $34 CAD for the two-hour pilot, and the last three eps of the season ALONE.For the reviewer aways down who complained about the last episode being a cliffhanger......that's the way its always been. That arc is concluded in the season 2 premier. I can certainly understand the guy's frustration, though----its one of the better cliffhangers I've seen.	5.0	Terrific show, well worth any SF fan's time.	2004-03-24	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A6J7GN6ZOR085	lonebeaut	"I discovered Stargate SG-1 a little late (just last year) when I started watching it on a local movie channel.  I picked it up out of boredom one Sunday evening somewhere in the 6th season and soon kicked myself for missing the other seasons.  So I decided to treat myself to an Amazon Prime subscription (I'd already had two freebie trials) mostly to catch up on SSG-1 from the very beginning (including the James Spader/Kurt Russell film on which it's based).  I should say that I had just completed the entire MacGyver TV series (which I also missed the first time around) on-line and became fascinated with Richard Dean Anderson as an actor. So it was a natural progression to move on to SSG-1 next.This time RDA plays a guy with a gun who constantly extricates himself and his colleagues from impossible situations, kind of like MacGyver, a guy w/o a gun doing basically the same stuff, only on Planet Earth. But as Colonel Jack O'Neill, he's acquired a sense of humor and irreverence, a welcome change from the super-polite boy scout MacGyver.The first season cleared up some mysteries about characters and places and plot lines (I'm simultaneously watching the tail end of the series on TV, which is sometimes confusing), which can get pretty complicated if you lose the thread of the series.I'm a Star Trek (original series) snob, so becoming engrossed in this series is odd for me.  Not every episode I've watched of SSG-1 so far is a winner, but I find myself tearing up and getting goose bumps a lot.  The main characters are three-dimensional--even Teal'c seems genuine--and I love the idea of a stargate to other planets and galaxies.It's a bit weird to me that so many of the people on the planets they visit look like they're from biblical or medieval times yet have such advanced technologies.  And the fact that everybody everywhere seems to instantly understand English is a little off-putting. And the characters can't seem to pronounce those nasty aliens the same way every time (""Gould"" versus ""Go-ah-oold"").  And there are often loose ends left dangling at the end of the show.  But hey, it's sci fi, it's a TV show written by mere earthlings, and I'll continue watching until I see every season and every episode and the movies that came after.I highly recommend it."	5.0	Stargate obsessed	2013-09-03	0	0	0

It has it's silly momets and there is always a touch of humour to go along with the adventure.  The Stargate is a wormhole device that connects to other Stargates spread throughout the galaxy on planets capable of sustaining human lifeforms.  SG-1 is the first of 12 or 13 teams that goes thru the Gates to explore these worlds, meet their inhabitants and look for means to fight the Gau'ould-a race of parasitic beings that use humanoids as hosts which control other races as their 'Gods' using technology to make the lesser beings believe in them-they are not the Good Guys.An interesting side-note.  The weapons and military functions are spot-on as the producers had the U.S. military as advisers for the series as is the science behind most of the adventures.Last but ot least, the series had a ending versus just dissapearing so from Season 1 to Season 10 it is a complete story.	5.0	It's STARGATE!	2014-03-20	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ATTNG1JMOPBYJ	Mark Hanna	This is the greatest show on earth, I love my season one set, and would pay 800 bucks just for season 2.  If anyone knows when they plan on releasing it let me know, please.  For all you science fiction fans or just regular tv viewers or people who don't watch tv, get this DVD set anyway cause you won't be able to stop watching them.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1FM74W2V0X3QC	Mark Luljak	To be fair, while this episode does contain copious amounts of flashbacks, and was likely done to free up production money for the next two episodes, it does actually contain a good amount of fresh footage.  The plot is advanced more than the other reviewer seemed to think, and more than I originally thought.Without this episode, you don't have a proper introduction to Senator Kinsey, which is a character that plays a strong part through the first seven seasons or so, and is a beloved and excellently executed role.  There are some other minor plot advancements, but that one alone, as well as how it sets the stage for the later NID arc introduction and development, are worth viewing this.	3.0	Not strong, but does advance the plot...	2012-10-12	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3DV08GDAX3BC	"Marshall Hyman ""Marshall Hyman"""	By expanding the lore, giving it a bigger budget, and for good measure, throw MacGyver in there. As great as the source material is, the series consistently ups the ante and improves on every detail. With increasingly creative ideas for a modern take on the Star Trek formula, the show keeps you entertained episode to episode, while introducing you to an ever expanding universe that turns out to be incredibly intricate. Blah blah blah, watch it, it's great episodic sci-fi action with all your favorite tropes.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AHQ19PG0UAJ7O	matt givens	I never bother writing a review about any Film or TV series, but I think its worth while telling all you &quot;Doubting Thomas's&quot; out there.First I have to tell you I loved the Film. The concept and storyline was original and well scripted,the acting supurb. This is what motivated me to start watching the series.....I was not disapointed.The Series continues on where the film left off. Col. Jack O'Niel has returned through the stargate and the corridor between the two world is not working anymore, or is it.A new Enemy appears through the earth Stargate and after a few killings returns to where it came from.The Stargate still works!!After returning to Abidos they find new addresses to go to which will take a supercomputor 1 month to churn out about 3-4 places they can go. HEY THAT MEANS THEY CAN GO TO A DIFFERENT PLACE EACH WEEK!!...Thus the TV Series.All Ive done is given you background here. I don't want to spoil anyones fun. Its a Sci-Fi with a difference as it is travelling to other worlds in galaxys far far away,but compounded with Earths History, religions and beliefs. The caracters are real and very entertaining.As Ive watched up to series 4, I can tell you that it only gets better and better.This Box Set. This box set is packed with alot more footage and featuretts!It hold the whole first series on 5 DVDs and by the time you have watched the first disc your hooked.All the effects and story lines take a big leap by disc 3 when all caracters are introduced enough that the story in each episode is the story of each episode. I give this box set 9/10 and tell all you folks in the USA that seris 2,3 and 4 get a 10/10 so start your collection now, dont wait... I garentee you wont regret it.

Wise ass comments, humor, great casting, writing, and some very cool production and Richard dean Anderson, you all know as MacGyver, it's a fun sci-fi adventure show.So....in my P.O.V. &#34;my point of view&#34;, give it a shot and I would like to believe you will not go wrong.	5.0	Great viewing!!	2014-05-28	0	0	0

This series is not the longest running series still showing (11th season?) and is surpassed only by Dr. Who for most episodes ever. The TV show takes up right where the Theatrical Release Movie ended. Actors are excellent. Once you start this series, you'll get hooked and HAVE to have each season on DVD. Go for the thin-packs for space saving.Warning - premier episode is rated R, unlike the rest of the shows which are probably PG-13.	5.0	Stargate SG-1 Is Great Sci-fi Viewing	2007-02-16	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AN3VMXWYZYY5F	M. Carver	"Don't get me wrong I love Stargate SG1. I own every season. It is by far on eof the best series of all time. The reason I am giving it a rating of 3 is based solely on the price. I know at least at the Wal-Mart near me I could pick up the first five season for only $19.95 each. The fact that Amazon is charging over double that does not bode well for them.My advice, if you want this series, and you should want it. Check you local stores first to see if they have it cheaper for you. You could either spend $100 at walmart for the first five seasons or over $200 to buy them seperately here. I would also reccomend getting the complete series boxed set over just buying each season seprately. I believe amazon has the boxed set priced at roughly what it would cost to buy half of the series by the season.In other words ""Buy this series.""

The writing was no less than 'Top Drawer' and the actors were perfect for the roles they played.  Production values were excellent.  If the rating scale went to 10, I would rate it an ""11""!  The Sci-Fi Channel (Now ""SyFy"") should be commended for picking up the franchise and giving viewers many more years of thoroughly  excellent entertainment!  If the possibility exists that you might know someone who as never seen SG-1, A ""FULL CARTON"" of all ten years of the series on DVD would make an excellent gift.

Well now that your all grown up you can still find that fun with Stargate SG-1.The series is everything that TV Sci-Fi should be, and all too often isn't.  The show takes itself seriously, but not too seriously.  It has flashy SPFX, techno babble and even the occasional hot alien babe, all standard in media Sci-Fi, but it also had good production values, decent writing, humor,  and actors who understand that entertainment deserves just as much of their hard work as Shakespeare. The cast chemistry is what really makes SG-1 stand out from most of the Sci-Fi on TV.  They play well off each other and &quot;click&quot; as a cast on screen.SG-1 is not the sort of Sci-Fi that will change your view of the Universe, but it's just what you need to unwind at the end of a stressful day. These days that's just as important.	5.0	As fun as TV was when you were a kid.	2003-06-24	1	1	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AGNURDZC3AL0V	Michael	I hated the fact that this program was on Showtime for so many years.  I never got to see it until it went into syndication.  When it finally did, I'd catch bits and pieces of previous plot lines that referenced earlier episodes...none of which I'd ever seen.  So, when the gift certificate came at Christmas for Amazon.com, I aimed to get this DVD collection as my first to use with my first DVD player -- a Toshiba SD3800 (progressive scan).I agree a little with the last reviewer about the quality of some of the video on the DVDs in this collection.  I can tell when the varying quality of the anamorphic conversion results in either (a) a clean, crisp image or (b) a rather grainy image.  On my piddly TV, however, it's not too noticable unless you're aware of it beforehand.  DOH!  Now you're aware of it.  Don't let it keep you from ordering this collection.Although the featurettes are limited, I enjoyed them.  Getting to hear from the actors who play the characters is interesting, although I was befuddled as to why Richard Dean Anderson wasn't featured in this first collection.  Instead, Dr. Carter and General Hammond are the two people covered in the featurettes, along with some other topics.  Weird, but maybe they're saving Colonel O'Neill for the second collection.Bottom line -- if you're a fan of the show who DID NOT have Showtime and have no clue what these guys are talking about in later episodes (including the ones on Sci-Fi), buy this collection.  Nitpick about the quality if you want.  Enough complaints will get 'em to fix the problems and, hopefully, churn out more Stargate SG-1 season collections in the future.	5.0	Great DVD collection -- my first, and not my last	2003-01-22	7	7	0

It seems a great shame that MGM/UA would have let their original source material degrade that much.  Also, no 5.1 audio option, grumble, grumble. Yet for this DVD collection to rate 4 stars despite the poor video and lackluster audio speaks volumes about the fact that these episodes are just very enjoyable science fiction stories.	4.0	A few flaws, but well worth the money	2001-05-29	2	0	2

As they grew into their parts and made the characters their own it became easier to get caught up in the fantasy.

He's been lending them to me for a month now, and I must admit, the series is somewhat addictive.  I have all the Star Trek NG collection, and the Stargate series is less ""even"" than STNG, but the same can be said of most TV series.

I was caught off guard by some of the material included in the episodes that were not aired onTV.  There is a warning that some of the special features include unrated material but not that the episodes do.  There is a scene with females full frontal nudity in the pilot.  Would have been nice to know that ahead of time!  Made it a bit uncomfortable for my teenage boys (13 - 17) and 11 year old daughter who were watching it with me.  Was it really necessary?  The shot from the back gave enough of a message of what was happening we did not need to full Monty in a DVD that says it's rating is PG-13.

The acting is superb and nearly every episode is full of action and suspense. The technobabble is under control and it is fairly easy to lose yourself beyond disbelief in what's going on. Well.. BSG was pretty good too. I'd highly recommend both series to any watching science fiction fans. It beats the whammy out of watching all the UFO reality shows, zombies, fairies, and vampire crap that the SyFy channel now puts out. What makes this collection special is there are no ads.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1NGYYT0IZ8WER	"M ""Mahollo"""	"Decent acting, and passable serial and larger story arc development, but horrible character/personality development. How is it that Lori Grimes (a la 'Walking Dead') has attracted more of a hate following than Daniel Jackson? I really liked his character in the movie (played by James Spader), but in the TV series he continually puts the team at risk (e.g., episode where they rescue Catherine's fiancee Ernest), is selfish to the point of pathology (e.g., willing to sacrifice Sam to save Sha're-S2:E2), has questionable morality (willing to let a woman be raped in The Broca Divide is not anthropological sensitivity), has more symptoms of ADHD than is believable in someone who has supposedly risen to the top of his academic field (e.g., Tin Man episode when trying to release air pressure), and is often absolutely clueless/naive as to how an anthropologist should actually behave. If he were a member of my team, I would have fired him after one of the first episodes. I'm sure there were better ways of writing the character so that he might be more believable.The rest of the team are alright. They have some annoying moments and often fail to ask even the most basic questions, and they tend to escalate situations needlessly, e.g., O'Neill being combative with Senator Kinsey in 'Politics' -- as I listened to the Senator, I was inclined to agree with Kinsey, instead O'Neill got defensive and as a result almost allowed Earth to be attacked because he failed to convince the Senator. Couple this with some major tactical blunders in many of the episodes (e.g., Daniel regularly shouting when stealth would have been more appropriate or Sam and Daniel walking down a road IN THE OPEN, behind enemy lines in the return to Chulak episode after taking a Goa'uld larva are just two examples) and it's amazing the team is still alive. You can write a compelling story without resorting to having the characters do stupid things to precipitate an adventure. And don't even get me started on Maj. Gen Hammond...maybe I can just chalk their deficiencies up to being in the 'chAir Force'...given all of this, I'm inclined to agree with Senator Kinsey when he angrily retorts to the General, ""Well, your best just isn't good enough!!"" The team does have some saving graces, Teal'c is consistently an entertaining and intelligent character to watch, O'Neill's moments of stubbornness and loyalty to his team are endearing, as is Sam's compassion and her capacity to reason through most problems (although at times she's laughably simplistic with her ""scientific"" explanations).I like good science fiction...a lot. This show had the potential to be fantastic. Like I said, I loved the movie, but the characters in the TV show suffered from poor development, making watching them very aggravating when they engaged in unrealistically irrational behavior. Is it too much to ask for some well thought out complexity in a TV show?"	2.0	Could have been great	2013-07-25	4	1	3

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3CYEM1JJLLGUQ	"M. Nocerino ""Sci Fi Fan"""	"This is one of the most well written, acted and directed shows on television.  Since the first season, Stargate has given viewers interesting characters and compelling stories.  While each episode stands on its own, the beauty of Stargate is truly realized when the consistency of the overall story can be seen.  Each episode helps to make the Stargate Universe more complete.  Plus it's a unique story, not simply a Hollywood Rehash.  Also, the story telling has such a unique depth to it.  After seven plus seasons, it's still going strong.Along with the great story are the great characters.  The same quality and consistency in the story telling also bleeds into character development.  At the heart, Stargate is about people.  Even with everything that happens, the stories are about the characters.  The story is told through the characters and their experiences.  This creates an environment where all the characters are so completely developed the audience empathizes with all of them.  Whether it's one of the main characters or the supporting cast or a guest spot, the audience cares about all of them.  This is something lacking in many movies and television shows.Good writing and directing can only work if there is good acting to go with them.  Richard Dean Anderson's wit, sense of humor, and professionalism lead the entire cast in this endeavor.  The cohesion between all the cast members is what brings these wonderful stories to life.  This cast is just as important as the show's writers and directors.  All of these aspects work together the create one of the best shows on television.Now-a-days there is too much emphasis on gimmicks and ""one trick ponies"" and ""pushing the envelope"" and all that stuff.  Producers think they can only ""wow"" an audience with two things:  crudeness or ""flash and bang.""  How about wowing the audience with a decent product for once?  If there was more quality programming on television and in the movie theater, then projects like Stargate wouldn't stand out as much.  But that's a good thing.  I'd rather have 100 stations with Stargate quality programming instead of the majority of garbage that passes for entertainment these days."	5.0	And people say there is nothing good on television	2004-11-27	7	7	0

So I strongly recommend that you turn up the volume of the surrounds and the center.(but you should do that anyway for all movies)And about the interlacing-transition problem, it must depend on the drive you are using since I haven't had any problem with mine.And I must disagree with the reviewer below about the aspect ratio of the video.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A20NMV05C89OW3	"Musickate ""musickate"""	This is a wonderful show, one of my favorite SCI FI shows and easily one of the best Sci Fi shows on TV. The producers took an interesting movie and developed the premise into a thoroughly engrossing, unexpected and exciting galactic society, full of twists and turns and political in-fighting and inventive alien foes. The plots are unusual and creative, the characters are constantly developing over the course of the series and the action is excellent. [They don't fall into the clich&eacute; of the lead male character having a girl on every world or ship or anywhere else, either, which is refreshing.] It has now been renewed for a seventh season, and since Sci Fi shows somehow last only seven seasons (witness The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager) I can only wish that MGM would get the rest of the seasons out on DVD asap! -and  give a greenlight to the  movie. This show should run longer, as it is still fresh and witty. The first season DVDs got me hooked, and they show how it all started. I recommend it strongly.	5.0	Best  SciFi on TV	2003-01-18	3	2	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1CKI55R3KMWT2	"myfieldnotes ""CathyL6"""	This is a great series. And this boxed set covers the entire first season all in one fell swoop.The writing for the episodes was excellent picking up on the threads that the movie Stargate had left off on in a logical manner. The transition between the movie and the series being nearly seamless with the return of the Goa'uld and the re-opening of the Stargate on Abydos and without any of those huge contraditions that so many tv series seem to have when based on movies.And,I was immediately hooked on watching how the four characters, making up the team of SG-1, start out as strangers and then grow to be friends and fiercely loyal to one another.The interplay between Michael Shanks as Daniel Jackson and Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neill is worth the DVD's price alone. Michael Shanks shows us an earnest Daniel Jackson who still has that sense of childlike wonder despite the way life keeps knocking him down.  And Richard Dean Anderson creates a Jack O'Neill who is strongly military but with a wicked sense of humor.  Also, the added talents of Amanda Tapping (who plays Samantha Carter, an airforce captain and scientist) and Christopher Judge (Teal'c, a former first prime, a.k.a. head soldier, of the enemy) play off of these two in such a way that it makes a good balance.I would highly recommend this series to anyone who likes strong character development.Although I liked all the episodes (with the possible exception of Emancipation), I particularly liked: Cold Lazarus, Hathor, Fire &amp; Water, Solitudes, There But The Grace of God, and Within The Serpent's Grasp. My only objection is that Within The Serpent's Grasp is the first of two parts and I would really hope that MGM would hurry up and release the second season set so that I can buy the sequel to this episode to add it to my collection.Overall, the film quality of the DVD's was good. The storylines were well written (the characters learn and change throughout, with each episode adding a little bit to the previously established material, and not simply being the &quot;monster of the week&quot; vignette). I also liked the fact that the series, like the movie, uses elements of different historical time periods, particularly egyptology, to form many of their premises. (If you're a history buff or amateur archeologist you'll run into a lot of familiar myths and legends and historical facts.) Also, the added bonus material of interviews and such was fun.Would I recommend this to a friend to buy.  Yes. Do I think it's worth the money?  Yes.  Will I buy the next set.  Yes.So, if you liked Stargate the movie.  Or you like stories similar to the television show Farscape or books by such authors as Lois McMaster Bujold, where character development and witty dialogue are wrapped around adventures then I think you will enjoy this series too.Definitely a thumbs up!	5.0	Outstanding Series	2001-06-16	54	52	2

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	APYWPCBTBLVY3	NeferAkhen	Please, remember... this series was first aired by Showtime. It was also NOT during primetime. It was never intended for children. And if you do your homework properly that first disc is Rated R for a reason.I love the series (45 seconds of watching a woman naked does nothing for me, I have seen myself in the mirror before)I consider it makes a great job taking off from the movie, it deals well with the whole Daniel coming back scenery and I just love Richard Dean Anderson... and Michael Shanks... and Christopher Judge... They have chemistry, charisma and a great sense of humor. Highly recommend it for anyone to watch.Last thing to say on the whole nudity scene, it's not an erotic scene. They just show her naked. So, unless you are the kind of parent that would cover your kids' eyes when they go to the museum and see Renaissance statues and paintings with naked cherubs, women and men prancing around a field, there is nothing wrong with them seeing it.	5.0	SG1	2006-02-20	6	4	2

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1WAB7M1J2H2HC	"NFAToys ""NFAToys"""	I believe the popularity and success of the Stargate franchise has much to do with it being set in contemporary times.  The story pits human wisdom and technology against extra terrestrials possessing technology thousands of years more advanced than ours.

Things obviously make more sense. There is a clear sense of character development throughout the season, and only a couple episodes (like Emancipation) don't fit in very well. It ends on a cliffhanger, but, at this point, you shouldn't worry because you can just find season 2 on Amazon. Anyone who likes science fiction and a good story should watch this.	4.0	Very good	2013-05-28	0	0	0

In Children of the Gods, Skaara is taken to be host for Apophis and Aumanet's (sp)son. Later on, Hathor is 'mother' of all Goa'uld as Egeria is mother of all Tokra. So... can it both? Not for the Tokra since they are facing extinction I believe.I love the 1st ep as it sets the tone for the rest of the series. I love Shank's impression of Spader. (I prefer nerdy Jackson, to macho Jackson) Tapping's Carter is so-so with that horrific 'internal plumbing' line but gets better. Quickly. Its always a darn shame a TV series can't equal the big feel of the movie, even just extra-wise so a movie population of 5000 isn't pared down to a town of 50.	5.0	goa'uld reproduction	2009-02-26	14	1	13
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1AIFBPDJ5QAUY	"N. V. Anden ""Iconoclast"""	Few remember that the Sg-1 franchise actually started on Showtime in the 90s.  That's why the production and other values are so high. It is to the credit of the producers, actors and others that those standards were maintained throughout the 10 season one.  Season One set the tone with many episodes that were humanistic and not just special effects/CGI showoffs. I particularly liked the episode about a  daring scientist who, during WW2, had walked through the Gate in a Deep Sea Diving suit and then could not return. Unfortunately the show's creators chose not to explore the situation and characters beyond that single episode.	5.0	Still viewable after all these years.	2013-07-16	0	0	0

This is where the concept of the original movie expanded after the Goa'uld found that our planet was back on the map, so to speak. For those of you who perhaps tuned in later in the series' run, this package contains the origin backstory. How did we get involved with these parasites? Who were the primary players, and where did they come from? Richard Dean Anderson added another iconic character to his resume. These were characters that the viewer came to care about, and waited impatiently until the next episode. Order, sit back and enjoy. By the way, these episodes did originate on Showtime.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ATTLF1F0RHJ3S	Paul Saari	this is by far my favorite TV show I've ever seen (and in my opinion far superior to the movie). Awesome Scifi elements, awesome characters (for heroes and Villains), its serious, and on occasion really funny. Another big thing I loved about the show were the interesting morality play episodes where SG-1 and Hammond would have to fight off less idealistic elements of the Government to do the right thing. I also was always a bit obsessed with ancient Egyptian mythology so I really loved the detail they put into that. I missed most of the showtime seasons growing up, but when it hit The Scifi Network it was one of those shows I always knew when it was on, and was disappointed if I couldn't find the time to watch it or my mother could no longer afford cable and internet (tough choice but had to go with internet), but I've since then caught up on everything I missed.

Therefore, I eagerly ordered the first three seasons in the ""Thinpak"" edition from Amazon only to find that each of the seasons included episodes that pixelated and or were otherwise unwatchable (e.g., no sound for one of the characters or, in one case, a disk that would not even load). I reported the situation to Amazon and they promptly sent me replacements for all three seasons. Unfortunately, the same disks had the same problems in the replacement sets. I reported the situation to Amazon again, and received (in part) the following reply:""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We are returning the defective items to our suppliers. We will get new stock into our fulfillment centers with in few days.

I was a big star Trek fan but not any longer.  Stargate changed that.  By season 3 I was addicted.  Big argument between SG1, stargate Atlantis and SGU, which is better.  They are all different.  SGU is for grownups who want a darker series.  There was no character to like in SGU but except a couple.  SG1 is the antithesis, with many characters to like but the story had less of an edge until later in the series.  SG Atlantis was in between with may characters to like and edgy.  I would say, SG1 gave Atlantis a run for its money.  I liked all three series.  The only issue I had with Stargate is it is not in HD.	5.0	Great series	2013-07-29	0	0	0

Hardy	"[--I watched ""Stargate"" the movie and practically own the theatrical version on VHS and the special Edition DVD (which in itself is a much better buy than buying the Stand-alone theatrical version DVD, which probably doesn't exist.), and I have to say that back in 94' I mistaked it for a horror movie because being the child that I was when I saw back when I kept running through my living room too afraid to stare at the screen, but now that I'm older I watched the Special Edition DVD and I enjoyed this movie immensely.--]So you can say I was skeptic to find out that made a TV series out of it. I was skeptic, really, but I watched it with my Dad (whom is a fan of this series ""SG-1"") every week on the Sci-fi channel from Season one to Season Eight. Only because Richard Dean Anderson (whom, once upon time played ""MacGyver"") was in it, which was something I had to get over; he was no Kurt Russell. Sad to say, I'm not impressed with this Series. I was disappointed to find out that the only two returning characters, Colonel Jack O'Neil and Daniel Jackson (played by R.D Anderson and Michael Shanks) are the carbon cardboard copies of their former selves of who I came to know in the movie. The actor they have playing Kalwalsky really isn't a convincing Kalwalsky.The new characters: Dr. Samantha Carter (----Amanda Tapping), General George Hammond (--- John S. Davis?), and Teal'c (--- Christopher[?] Judge) are about as one-dimensional as a peice cardboard box. None of these characters have not a bit of ""Character"" or personality that could make them one bit likable; Jack O'Neil is supposed to be this comic relief to the show with witty comments that sound like some butchered attempt to mimic Buffy: The vampire slayer's strange worded phrases; he doesn't understand anything Dr. Carter says to him when she explains something to him during a crisis [-- which makes me question his intelligence] and he's always joking in every single episode: he's not even believable when he's being dramatic. I agree with my mother when she wonders how he ever became a colonel, she calls him a ""dumb-cuff"": Give me Kurt Russell any day.Daniel Jackson, whom was slightly annoying in the movie but had some type of character, somehow becomes only more annoying in the series and characterless in the series. He's always playing peace keeper (my interpretation of him: ""No Jack, don't kill the aliens, we need to discover ways to help them! We come in peace! Where's my wife? Find my wife Jack, you promised!"") and is always asking redundant questions or stuttering out his conclusions to problems (James Spader, please). Samantha Carter is supposed to be the genius of the group, always spewing out complex sentences to a man who has the comprehension of piece of wood, or immediately finding the cure to every virus they bring back through the Stargate/Wormhole, with a butch haircut that doesn't flatter her already plain features. General Hammond does nothing but sit in his office talking to the president of the untied States, telling some operator to ""Open the iris,"" or restricting or allowing the SG-1 team from doing something that they aren't supposed to do. And lastly Teal'c --- the one emotion ranged character -- formerly an elite guard for a man on a different planet now an official fixture of SG-1 thanks to ""dumb-cuff"" O'Neil's word, is probably the only likable character in this series, but is about as interesting as all the others. I can only commend this character for being straightforward with his answers and conclusions.The show gives a name to the mysterious aliens in which the character of the movie meet; they're called the Gou'ald, parasite type creatures that take control of entire civilizations making their human -- or alien conquered their bodily hosts, spreading fear into the hearts of the universe (save for a bunch of gray aliens called the Asgard who put to shame the mythology of Thor). One day Jack O'Neil is called back into action for some particular reason and travels back to the once nameless planet-- Abydos--- where he, Kalwalsky, a bunch of nameless soldiers, and Dr. Carter meets up with Daniel Jackson and unexpected trouble. They meet up with the boy who admired Jack in the movie, the only returning actor from the movie itself but their happy little reunion is ruined when the Gou'ald arrive through the Stargate and Kidnap Daniel's wife.Naturally ""Dumb-cuff"" Jack and co. go to rescue her after learning the address of the other planet but end up getting caught themselves, this where they meet Teal'c and learn that Daniel's wife has been taken by host by a queen Gou'ald. I won't spoil the rest. But basically the episodes afterward boils down to episodes concerning, alternate universes the SG-1 travels to, they get captured or accused by the inhabitants of another planet, they bring a virus back through the stargate or something bad happens to Jack or Daniel (which is every other episode), they pretty much to the same thing but with more inventive ways of doing so. The CGI animated graphics aren't great -- Its your run of the mill TV animation, the plots concerning the Gou'ald become repetitive (you'd wish they'd go and blow them all away) and little tid bits like the incorrect name for O'Neil's son --- Charile (Tyler O'Neil in the movie) and perhaps his wife Sarah--- (I just heard Mrs.O'Neil in the movie). The fact that the SG-1's team Dr. Carter or Daniel ends up saving the day around ""6:50PM"" really bug me: they're too smart and know too much of everything. Not to mention that the constant reoccurring subplot to put Jack and Sam together in alternate universes and the current timeline really annoys me to no end. Because quite frankly, as the show progresses and when Jack becomes Genneral [poor dude]and he gets older, to see him kissing Sam is like watching someone's father kiss their daughter, its highly disturbing: He's like over 55 years old (grandpa age), God knows how old Sam is (30's maybe). But I know the writers and the producers just did that to satisify all those idiots (mostly female idiots) that can't stand to see two characters with chemistry as best friends, but as lovers because they have knowing else better to think about (This type of thing doesn't suit Richard Dean Anderson: Remember ""MacGyver's women""? Shudders.)Lastly the music in the show is horrible: it consists of repeating the theme of Stargate... the theme for the once nameless enemy ... and crummy military type music. All in all, Stargate-SG-1 will always remain to me an idea was good on a piece of paper but wasn't correctly executed on TV and never as good as the movie was. Its not a bad television show: it has its decent moments of great action (a special guest appearance by Gundam Wing's English voice actor of Sally Po, Samantha Ferris in the episodes ""Out of mind"" and ""Into the fire."" She also appeared in Smallville's Fourth Season's episode ""Scare"" playing a district attorney that gives Lionel Luthor a ""Get out of free jail card,"") and an actual plot that doesn't have to do with Gou'ald. But like Transformers and Dragon Ball Z you either like or hate it. For me its a little bit of both. [a 3 out of 5]"	3.0	"Qoute: ""Dum-cuff"": End qoute.

It's scifi at it's best with good drama mixed in with the comedy.  The scripts are tight, the dialogue is smart and funny and the characters are consistent and have great chemistry.  They even have outstanding special effects, especially for a tv series.  But I'll start deducting stars if the format of the disks hasn't been changed to allow a ""play all"" option, like the Atlantis set.  Scrolling through those menus after every episode is a real pain.  I'm going to buy one season (either 1 or 8) and check it out.

I was very disappointed and would rather have an edited version.  I gave it four stars only because my family likes Stargate and we've been watching on fuzzy antenae reception for years.

They did not include the episode in the Box set.3 Hours of TBC'ed on the last disk not to get the end? For $... I expected to see the last episode of Season one.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A29R3O02O0PON4	"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head"""	Well, I just received this boxed set a couple days priot to this writing and all I can say is that Stargate SG-1 is indeed a great amount of fun.  Some episodes are exciting and action packed like the Pilot episode and some are emotional like the Singularity in which Carter becomes attached to a little girl who has a Ga'ould implanted nuclear bomb in her chest.The only negatives to this set is that due to the series supposedly subpar cameras, the dark scenes especially like in the briefing and control rooms are very grainy.  Other than that, most images are clear.  Some reviews speak of video and audio glitches, I have watched all but the last disc and I have yet to discover any.  Some speak of a problem with the sound in the Nox episode, well in fact, the sound seemed to get better in that episode.  You do get a few playback pauses in certain episodes where your player switches layers.  But other than that, the set plays flawlessly.My father and I have been into and out of this series every since it started.  While I thought that I had missed most of the 1st season, I discovered that I had actually seen many of these episodes and actually lost track of the series during the second and third seasons.  So I'm anxiously awaiting the release of these seasons to DVD.  But if you liked the intial Ga'ould incursion then you'll enjoy this season.  This season also sets the mood of the series in that it basically says that the Ga'ould displaced people from Earth from many different time periods to other planets across the Stargate network.  My father and I thoroughly enjoyed the pilot episode in which it really ties in the '94 movie with the series.	4.0	Here's hoping that MGM releases Seasons 2-4 soon.	2002-01-08	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3GG53NVCRX0U9	RDA fan forever	Stargate SG1 Season 1 - is the first of 10 seasons of the best longrunning TV series of all time (IMHO).  All the DVD's of these seasons are of excellent quality, but be sure to buy them one season at a time rather than the product where all the seasons are in one package.  From what I have read of the product where all the seasons are in one package the videos are of not good quality at all - the individual seasons (The complete Season 1, The complete Season 2, etc) are of much better quality.  It may cost a bit more, but it is well worth the price to get the excellent quality DVD's that you will enjoy watching for years to come.  Stargate SG1 is simply delightful television series viewing and each season's DVD set is well worth the price to have for now and in the future.Even if you are not a Sci Fi fan (which I am not), the acting, the character interplay, the action, the imagination, and the storylines along with the special effects combine to make Stargate SG1 the best and most long running series of this type ever on TV.I especially enjoy Richard Dean Anderson's portrayal of Col (later General) Jack O'Neill (with 2 ll's).  He is tall, handsome, with just the right amount of action and nuanced acting and is, let's face it, a great TV hero.  But the thing I enjoy the most is the sense of humor - both from the character O'Neill and from his awesome remaining cast of Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, Michael Shanks, and Don S Davis (God rest his soul).A theme that is developed through the seasons and can be watched to develop if one purchases all the first 8 seasons (which I have done) is the undercurrent of the relationship between Col. O'Neill (Anderson) and Captain (then Major) Samantha Carter (Tapping).  There are episodes where this relationship is shown to be more than just the professional military one.  But that is just one of the themes to watch throughout this series.The interplay between Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), Teal'c (Christopher Judge, and General Hammond (Don S. Davis) is also matchless.  The acting is so smooth and well done that it appears to be perfect in each scene.  A delightful pleasure to watch beginning with Season 1 and going all the way through Season 8.Unfortunately, Seasons 9 and 10 have Richard Dean Anderson in only minor appearances.  His presence makes the series what it is, IMHO, so those last 2 seasons are, again IMHO, disappointing.Again, strongly recommend purchasing not only the foundation laying Season 1 of Stargate SG1, but also the individual remaining seasons of this series (through Season 8).  You will be delighted!	5.0	Stargate SG1 - Season 1 - start of BEST tv series ever	2013-09-17	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1YDC0VZ9KOVK5	rebeccafrog	On the whole, it's cheesy sci-fi, and that's why I love it so. Like any sci-fi series, the first few episodes are cheese-tastic, but it gets better as the producers, et al, figure out what they're doing and where they're going with it. If you get this set, you'll also want to get season two, because the last disc ends with the season finale cliffhanger, which is sufficiently compelling that you'll really feel it necessary to go buy the next set, if you haven't already. Be grateful. It was nine months between when I bought it and season two was released.	5.0	The series is better than the movie, by far	2002-11-09	1	0	1

Its set on our time and that is what it makes it really cool to wach.The first season has great episodes for a first season, but like all it only introduces some things that in later seasons will be revealed and believe me its worth it.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AF7MDAYW3ZQD0	Rich Matheson	I just bought this boxed set, sight unseen.  I don't even have a DVD player yet, but I'm buying one BECAUSE of this little item.  Stargate SG-1 is a spectacular show.  The best on TV, in my opinion.  Watch the original movie, and then watch the premeire episode.  It's almost like watching a single show, save for the different actors playing the characters and some minor sound differences.  A few inconsistencies aside, the movie and series are perfect together.  SG-1 is quite simply the finest science fiction series in the last several years.  I'd miss an entire season of DS9 or Voyager before I'd miss a single episode of Stargate.  The writing is engaging, entertaining, and intelligent, and the characters are unparalleled.  Buy it.  If you liked the movie, the series is a step above and beyond.  You'll LOVE it.	5.0	Skeptical people, Listen to me.	2001-06-17	18	12	6

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A38QIWWPWGNHUD	R. J. BERGGREN	I bought the Stargate season 1 boxed set on a whim.  It seemed a bargain for a season of television.  It took me just over a week to blow through the entirety of season one.  Stargate has easily become one of my all time favorite television shows.  The writers do an excellent job of developing the characters, and keeping an ever growing continuity from tripping over itself.  My only complaint is that three of the discs have 5 episodes on them which degrades the video quality somewhat.  Had the episodes been spread out more effectively with 4 episodes per DVD, the quality would have improved.  That said, the small lapse in quality is a miniscule price to pay for such an excellent serial drama.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	5.0	Far better than the film	2001-08-13	4	2	2

Meleady ""sci-fi fan"""	I have been watching SG-1 from the beginning, and it is one of those rare shows that seems to get better every season.  This season one boxed set lets you experience the show from it's very beginning, as the cast and crew develop the characters distinctive personalities and the overall plot line for the entire show.The chemistry between cast members is awesome.  I especially like Richard Dean Anderson's character, Col. Jack O'Neil.  In a major departure from his McGuiver character, he is a tough, no nonsense, gungho military type who is pretty dense where science and technology is concerned, which provides for some occasional well placed comic relief.  The female lead character is an attractive, genius level IQ, kick your butt in a heartbeat Air Force officer.  She is as proficient with a H&amp;K MP-90 assault rifle as she is with an Oscope.The remaining characters are just as good and just as excentric as these two.  Mix in the outstanding sets, props, costumes, and special effects, and you have a show that I feel is the best Sci-Fi show out there today.  This boxed set includes comments from cast and crew on their roles, production values and techniques, costuming, etc.If I were given a choice between Stargate SG-1, Farscape, and any Star Trek show, Stargate SG-1 would win hands down.I am already eagerly anticipating the arrival of the second season boxed set, as well as the latest season opener on Showtime.	5.0	The best just keeps getting better.	2001-06-26	9	8	1
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1XZJ32DJS8YV2	"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader"""	The writers of SG1 are a lot like the original Star Trek with Kirk and Spock. Striving to broaden the appeal from scifi to moralistic storytelling. In many ways, SG1 succeeds in this direction. The shows often involve a serious topic, not lost among the special effects and battle scenes, but rather a big part of the reason to watch it.Its not heavy or deeply moralistic in the sense of right and wrong, but rather ideas like &quot;brains in vats&quot;, parallel universes, nature of self etc. For me this is the draw of the StarTreks which seems to decrease each new series, but is renewed in SG1.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"The first season of STARGATE SG-1 was by no standard an especially great one, though by the end of the season there were hints that the show had the potential to become more than what we saw in the first season.  This was certainly not the first subsequently successful television series to be somewhat slow out of the gate.  The first season of FARSCAPE certainly gave little indication of how brilliant the show would become in Seasons Two and Three.  Some shows just have to get warmed up.Since the long narrative arc has come to dominate genre television since its establishment and development by TWIN PEAKS, THE X-FILES, and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, most shows seem to have taken either of two paths.  Some, such as ROSWELL and LOST, have been able to work off a long story arc from the outset; others, such as FARSCAPE, SMALLVILLE, and STARGATE SG-1, get trapped in a stand alone pattern, only gradually breaking out to embrace a longer narrative arc.  Especially after THE X-FILES mythology episodes and BUFFY, one wonders why any show would embrace the stand-alone episode format.  The answer probably lies with the network and not the creators of the series.  There is no question that shows with longer narrative arcs, while vastly more rewarding to fans, make things more difficult for new viewers.  Network execs like to push shows to stand alone episodes to attract new viewers, thus making the shows more attractive to advertisers.  Part of the agreement with the renewal of ANGEL in its fifth season, for instance, was an agreement to feature more stand alone episodes (but being a Joss Whedon show, they snuck in a story arc anyway).  Season One of STARGATE SG-1 suffers by its more or less adherence to the stand-alone episode format.  By the end of the season, however, this was beginning to break down, and the season ended with a lovely multi-part sequence that referenced several episodes from earlier in the season.Before the show was a series, it was, of course, a movie, and a not terribly good movie at that.  The film spent most of its time in set up, leaving little time for plot development or action.  In a way, Season One emulates this.  Much of the first season is spent developing its own world, populating it with characters, establishing the pretext for subsequent seasons.  Luckily, a great number of seasons followed, so unlike most shows, where the first season would have set things up for two or three or four seasons, this one created the background for nine or more.  The result has been the longest continuously running Sci-fi series in TV history (DR. WHO having periodically taken shorter or longer breaks).One other problem the show has is a typical first season difficulty that one could argue has never been successfully transcended.  Compared to most other genre shows, STARGATE SG-1 has a remarkably small core cast.  It supplements this by a host of recurring minor characters, but essentially for most of its run the cast has consisted of the characters Jack O'Neill, Daniel Jackson, Samantha Carter, Teal'c, and General Hammond.  A host of minor supporting characters has expanded this to a degree.  For instance, stunt coordinator Dan Shea (and Richard Dean Anderson's stunt double) has frequently appeared as Sgt. Siler and Gary Jones as Sgt. Harriman is part of the show's furniture, while the lovely Teryl Rothery has been a mainstay on the show as Star Gate Command's medical officer.  But these characters always remain supporting characters.  They rarely if ever receive any focus and never get to be the show's heroes.  If STARGATE SG-1 has had a problem, it is in the lack of a rich ensemble cast.  My personal opinion is that the show might have been stronger if instead of the core five it had had a revolving group of seven or eight central characters.  But since we can't go back and reshoot the series, there is no way to know if I am right or wrong.The writing for the first season was not as good as it would get later.  There were few out and out bad episodes, but few truly outstanding ones, and even fewer that would stand comparison with the best episodes from other series such as FARSCAPE.  One of the best was ""Tin Man,"" in which the members of SG-1 awake in a laboratory on another world.  They discover that they have somehow had their minds and personalities somehow transferred to robotic bodies driven by a power source that they are unable to leave for any length of time.  Distraught over their condition, they pressure the person who did this to them to transfer them back to their physical bodies, only to discover that their bodies are intact and that they are in fact artificial copies.  They realize that they are clones that were made to aide in the maintenance of the base where their power supply exists and that the originals were going to be allowed to return to earth.  It is a plot worthy of Philip K. Dick and a very poignant episode.So, while this was by no means a bad first season, its main value lies in laying the foundation for better things to come."	4.0	A lackluster first season with promise of better things to come	2006-05-08	3	2	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2W77W2LKW0T99	robinson73	Although we are not necessarily sci-fi &#34;geeks&#34;, we love a good sci-fi show, especially one that's thoughtful and well-conceived. When you couple this with characters you care about, excellent writing, and good special effects, you have the Stargate series. We got hooked on this during its original run and even enjoyed some of the spin-off series', especially &#34;Atlantis.&#34; It's been a few years since we have seen this so we went back and watched the original movie (with Kurt Russell and James Spader). We then found this on Amazon Prime and started watching the series again. It hasn't lost a beat and is just as good (maybe better the second time around). Although the actors are different from the movie, it picks up the story line nicely. So if you like this type of drama/action series, you can't really do better than Stargate SG1.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A102OI2OY2NZF	RobynMWJ	First few episodes are good but not great, as the show finds its way bridging between the film and the series.  Main reason for this review is to note for those interested that the Amazon Instant Video shown is (as of the time of this writing) the edited-for-SciFiChannel version.  Thus the frontal female nudity that was shown originally on Showtime has been cut.  Personally, I think it's for the best, as one of the creators of the show, Brad Wright, apparently never wanted it included and objected to it repeatedly.  I mention it here for those who are aware of the scene and are wondering which version they'll get here on Amazon.  Additionally, in reference to another review, as of the time of this writing the commercial breaks aren't dead air, they're cut out as is usual for DVDs.	4.0	Note on Version	2012-08-01	2	2	0

Luckily on my dvd player, since the full frontal is at the end of a 'chapter' when I hit skip I don't actually miss any show, it just goes into the next chapter and you really don't miss anything at all. Ok, on to the review! :)I absolutely love Stargate! Who wouldn't love O'Niell's snarkiness? He's hilarious, and slowly over the seasons his snark rubs off on his team mates, especially Daniel, who starts out a nerd but several seasons later is kinda sexy (if not still annoying at times, lol)!Stargate is a MUST for any scifi fan or if you're looking to get into it. Action, comedy, drama, it's got it all!Sure it gets a little 'silly' now and then, but what scifi doesn't?

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2JPWSJZ8LHPCV	"R. Stevens ""August-K"""	If you liked Stargate the movie, you'll adore this series.  If you found the movie a bit slow and pedestrian, you'll be very pleasantly surprised by the first season of this series which has the rare distinction of being better than the movie it is based on.Stargate, SG-1, the series currently on cable and syndicated on FOX is a terrific scifi adventure show.  In brief, the &quot;Stargate&quot; is an ancient relic which allows travel via worm-hole to numerous other planets.  The classic sci-fi obstablce of language is creatively handled by the premise that these other cultures were &quot;seeded&quot; by the same aliens which potrayed ancient gods back in the time of the pharaohs (the same who built the pyramids).  (Later is season one we are introduced to other aliens, including the Roswell greys such as &quot;Thor&quot;).The cast benefited from some useful changes from the movie to the series.  &quot;Jack&quot; the leader is now played by Richard Dean Anderson (originally played by Kurt Russel in the movie).  He is less sullen and has a &quot;daffy side&quot; which makes an otherwise straight military character more intersting.  David Spader has been replaced by Michael Shanks (&quot;Daniel Jackson&quot;).  The cast is nicely rounded out with two new additions.  Amanda Tapping plays the brilliant physicist &quot;Capt. (Dr.) Samantha Carter&quot; (a millitary woman to the core, but with a soft side) and Christopher Judge playing &quot;Teal'c&quot; a jaffa turned good guy who makes good use of ironic facial expressions.The series begins right where the movie left off.  The first episode Jack has to go back to Abydos to retrieve Daniel Jackson, who is now married to a local woman.  By the end of the first episode the team is a well established entity and the action is fast and engaging.  The series clips along at nearly the pace of the TV series &quot;24&quot;.  Each episode builds on the last, yet stands alone nicely.The series culminates in a 3 part cliff hanger with the fate of SG-1 and indeed all of earth in the balance.  You can sit and watch this series all the way through and not be bored.  Before you start you'll want to order the second season!	5.0	Better Than the Movie!	2003-06-01	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3SD4CFPERCANZ	"Ry'lac Lieer ""realiti3"""	"Stargate SG-1 is the TV series that followed the Stargate movie.  It does a very good job carrying over the story while introducing a lasting antagonist (The Goa'uld) to the fray.This is Sci-Fi at its best; perhaps Sci-Fa.  Science Fantasy.  Stargate SG-1 does a brilliant job of blending the present, with a futuristic feel.  It also brings in some ancient history, and feeds of the mythological gods of the Egyptians, Norse, etc.The end of the first season really brings the ""science fiction"" feel to its utmost, primarily for the location it is set.  Throughout this season, and seasons to follow, this series takes the Sci Fi genre to not only the mentioned historical and fantastical realms, but throw in a dash of cyber punk, paranormal/supernatural - and it even brings home some real pure emotions now and again.The story weaves in and out of each episode like yarn in a quilt, sometimes bright and vibrant, sometimes dark and somber - but always promoting a singular ideal throughout and working towards the end (which, in its 8th season, hasn't yet been fully realized it would seem.)A small warning, as the packaging does fail to aptly mention:  The first episode, the ""pilot"" so to speak, has a few shots of full frontal nudity.The season ends on a cliffhanger that will want you to run out and grab season 2 so you know what happens next."	5.0	The TV series starts off strong!	2004-12-01	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3JG6X0VSDSK9B	Sandra D. Pohl	The story follows many published ideas that we (earth) were visited by others from other planets and runs with it.  This provides a good foundation for many more seasons.I chose this rating because the series deserves it.  Each episode stands as its own story in the continuing saga of SG1.  I like the references used i.e. &#8220;&#8230;it took us ? years to McGyver a system&#8230;&#8221; I think there is also a mention of &#8220;Showtime&#8221; as O'Neal's favorite.  The first seasons were developed for Showtime.The character development is excellent with relationships developing and growing, but never overwhelms the story.I would recommend this to any who likes a well written and developed series as it has action, relationship, history - the dark ages lated for 600 years.  Also excellent cast.	5.0	Excellent character development and a great story line.	2013-09-30	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	ATZKPCGDXQVB2	Scott A. Schilz	The Stargate SG-1 Season 1 Box Set is a great introduction to this excellent sci-fi series. Although the first season had its share of clunkers (as is only normal with any new series trying to find its footing), SG-1 succeeded in quickly establishing its characters and unique plotlines, and definitely had a much better first year than most series.While I do feel that the few aforementioned bad episodes were among the series' all-time worst (most notably, &quot;Emancipation&quot; and &quot;Brief Candle&quot;), these are easily excused since the high quality of most of the rest of the season more than makes up for it.Among my personal favorites of the first season:Children Of The Gods: A great follow-up to the movie, introducing us to characters both old and new. Lots of action and great special effects. My only complaint with the pilot episode is the inclusion of gratuitous and unnecessary nudity in the scene in which Sha're is possessed by the Goa'uld Amonet.Thor's Hammer: The series' first mention of the Asgard, who will become a major ally for Earth in later seasons. Also introduces the first ones, the Unas.The Torment Of Tantalus: A moving and awe-inspiring episode dealing with loneliness and the thirst for new scientific discoveries.Enigma: SG-1 rescues a few members of the Tollan race, who are vastly technologically superior to Earth but refuse to share their knowledge. Also introduces SG-1's NID nemesis, Colonel Maybourne.There But For The Grace Of God: Still one of my all-time favorite SG-1 episodes, this outing finds Daniel Jackson transported to a frightening alternate universe in which Earth is under attack from a devastating Goa'uld onslaught!Within The Serpent's Grasp: One of the show's best season-ending cliffhangers, in which SG-1 defy orders and risk all to prevent a vicious attack on Earth by Apophis.All in all, Stargate SG-1's first season did a great job in setting the tone and groundwork for the incredible years to follow. This box set is a great primer for this awesome science fiction series!	4.0	A Great Start...	2002-11-19	20	18	2
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A350MQKED2RIJK	Scott Cooper	There is a depth of backstory, if you need it. There is humor, if you need it. There is real emotion, if you need it. There is action, suspense...There are short arc and large arcs, if you need them.I have to say that I always avoided this show because I didn't think I would like old MacGuyver as an actor. Boy, was I wrong. His character is bedrock and he is much, much funnier than I expected.If you haven't, go back and watch the movie and get yourself at least five episodes into the show. If you can suffer it being a little dated, at times, you will be thoroughly entertained.	5.0	One of the best tv shows of all time...	2013-05-18	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A19GTQ0YMXO8VW	Shane - AFR	"***SPOILERS AHEAD***General Synopsis:After the events of the movie, Stargate Command has mothballed the gate program and assigned a skeleton crew to guard over humanity's greatest discovery. As time lingers on the remaining personnel grow lazy in their responsibilities only to have an alien incursion spring up out of the blue. Bewildered by previous events, the powers that be re-recruit a retired Colonel from the US Air Force known as Jack O'Neill(that's with two L's) to explain how in God's name aliens have breached the gate when they were reported dead by the previously mentioned O'Neill.Determined to never allow such a threat to be once again achieved, soon to be retired, General Hammond prepares a Mark V nuclear bomb to go through the gate. O'Neill, shocked by such a turn of events, is forced to come clean and inform the General that the people of Abydos are not dead and in fact the once believed dead Dr. Daniel Jackson is very much alive. Playing to General Hammond's better nature, O'Neill convinces Hammond to make contact with Abydos. After Abydos acknowledges, O'Neill, along with his previous team(along with Captain Samantha Carter, who has reproductive organs on the inside), venture forth through ""thee old orifice"" and reunite with the Dr. Jackson and the people of Abydos.Meanwhile Apophis, an ancient alien of the Goa'uld race, searches for a new host for his queen. Unable to locate a proper host, Apophis invades Abydos for a female suitable for implantation. While in search for the new host, Apophis's First Prime(most trusted and capable slave) selects a most attractive female from the people of Abydos. The female selected by Teal'C(the First Prime) happens to be the wife of Dr. Jackson.After returning to Earth with the wounded, O'Neill and Jackson request that they be allowed to pursue the enemy Apophis in order to regain the kidnapped Sha're, who becomes the new host of Apophis's queen. After permission is granted the team embarks through the gate only to be captured by Apophis's ground forces. Taken to a holding room with people taken from other worlds the team faces death as Apophis has ordered them to be executed. As they face the execution squad, O'Neill pleads to Teal'C to help him save the innocent. Doubtful of his God, Teal'C aids the band of Humans to escape the clutches of Apophis and return to Earth.***SPOILERS END***My views:The first episode, in what proves to be an outstanding series(and franchise), Children of the Gods part 1&2 are an exceptional first step into an amazing Science Fiction world. The episode sets the stage for Brad Wright and Johnathan Glassner's vision of a band of brilliant humans to face and fight the God's. I appreciate the fact that the producers didn't try to jump the shark and have the people of earth become some super SciFi superheros with special abilities magically achieving the impossible. Instead they had the team of intergalactic explores be the same as what any of us could achieve either through intelligence or training.Over a decade ago I stumbled onto this show on Showtime and have faithfully followed it until the end of Stargate: Atlantis when the franchise left behind the storyline created for SG-1 and Atlantis and decided to embrace a different feel with Stargate: Universe. It has been an amazing ride and I'm thankful to MGM for allowing the creation of the show. Thanks for reading and I hope you'll read my following reviews of other episodes as time goes on.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED. THANKS."	5.0	Chevron seven.......locked!	2011-05-21	16	13	3

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1IIFPOME6Z4TN	Shawn R. Benson	This is a great series and well worth obtaining. I'm 85% saticified with this box set, except for a couple of problems.1.) The biggest problem is no 5.1 audio. A show that is this new should have been redubbed if not recorded in 5.1 audio to begin with. I have also just purchased Star Trek Next Generations first season and they are in 5.1.2.) No English subtitles. I am friends with a deaf couple that enjoy the show but they can not watch these DVD's.3.) I have found two episodes on two different dvd's that are missing part the their soundtrack. The music in the background is there but spokens words are not. I have tried these two disc's in 4 different machines and the problem is still there.Other then these three problem these are must have is you are a fan. The 2.0 sound is very good, the bass is enough to rattle windows if you wish. The video transfer is top notch, with rich colors and deep black's.With this set being a &quot;test set&quot; to see how well the box set will sell, MGM did not want to put forth a money on it. I think that this set deserves 5.1 audio. It was wonderful to watch this set, it could be GREAT with a 5.1 soundtrack. If MGM could only fix these three small problem's I think this setwould do alot better than it has.	4.0	Stargate SG1 Season One	2002-03-31	7	7	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AODFY18U2LZV9	shuaddict	Or well my favorite show of any genre &lt;g> Might be spoilers ahead if you haven't watched any episodes yet, but I don't think it'll give anything much away.It started off .. oh .. a few so years ago when I was on vacation and I unsuspectingly sat down to watch Richard Dean Anderson's new show. For all you kids who didn't experience the late 80s .. that's MacGyver. I loved the show, but now when you see the mullet .. ooh, horrible &lt;g> I also watched Stargate (the movie) and it was interesting enough. So I watched an episode - The Nox, I think. And you know what, I thought it was absolutely horrid! And it wasn't just me. But don't worry, all is not lost. So back home, a couple of months later. I managed to catch the ending of an episode .. Children Of The Gods Part II. The dungeon part at the end. And it just blew me away. I was like OMG, how can it be sooooooo good?! How could I not know that? And since then I've been an uber-fan.Granted the first season had it's ups and downs. I never did end up liking The Nox - even after a few times watching it. Some episodes you would definitely need some 'background' into the whole SG1 universe before watching later episodes. Some notable episodes would be - COTG, Torment of Tantalus, There But For The Grace of God, Within The Serpent's Grasp. You will not be disappointed with the plot lines, acting, special effects .. and whatever else. I think it's because the Stargate gives endless possibilities .. they're not stuck on a spaceship all the time, as their focal point .. for example. And as you go through this 1st season you'll see what I mean.I can't comment much on the special features of the DVDs (because I haven't seen them all) but if you're a fan you'll love all the Behind The Scenes stuff. Especially love the video diary with the actors .. where they take you through the set, with their little commentaries. The DVD box set is packaged nicely enough, and is consistent in its appearance throughout all other seasons i.e. Season 1 - 5. So it's easy & nice to store as you add on with your collection - for example Region 2 has 6 discs, so it's a little more bulky.	5.0	My fav sci-fi show	2003-12-29	6	6	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AG2850YKWALDE	Simon Magus	"Firstly, be warned that if you purchase this ""NEW"" through Amazon, you will *NOT* receive the item shown (white cover) in the photo (or at least I didn't). Instead, you get a much older box set in a slipcase, with the older artwork, etc.Secondly, it's unfortunate that MGM has chosen to release such a poor quality set of DVDs. The picture quality is extremely grainy to the point that it seems like you're watching a VHS tape, during the dark scenes. This might have been fine 10 years ago, but for anyone who has become used to HD quality, you won't just be disappointed, you'll likely find your viewing experience far less enjoyable than you were hoping.Sadly, it appears that this is our only option for purchasing these on DVD, and it seems unlikely that they will get remastered soon, if ever."	1.0	Amazon ships wrong set & terrible quality	2012-05-19	11	9	2
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A1DTNHJ26AYM4O	"S. Johnson ""Sci-fi geek"""	I discovered Stargate SG-1 a few years ago while watching late night TV.  It turns out I was watching a syndicated episode.  I was immediately hooked on this wonderful sci-fi show.  I never had the chance to view seasons one or two, so I ordered the box sets of those seasons.  I was thrilled to see the beginning of this show, that picked up where the feature film left off.There are only a few limited special features in this box set but that doesn't matter.  The story lines and production values of this show stand on their own.  I never watched McGyver, but I'm now a big Richard Dean Anderson fan because of this box set.  Anderson always has his tongue firmly planted in his cheek as he portrays Jack O'Neil.  In fact, the entire cast, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis, is amazing and well cast.If you're a sci-fi fan, buy this boxed set.  If you're a fan of good stories, buy this box set.  If you're a fan of good characters created by great actors and writers, buy this box set.  Star Trek was never as deep, funny or good as Stargate SG-1.	5.0	A must see	2005-10-17	10	9	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A10HFS6CBKN1L8	Slow Rider	Stargate SG-1 has become one of our favorite shows, so we naturally wanted to buy the season 1 and 2 DVD collections. Unlike something like ST:TNG, this show was great from episode 1 on- none of that first season trying to get into character or sub-par special effects. The storylines are well thought out, well written, well acted, and overall very fun to watch.The quality of the season packages themselves is high- very professional and well done.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A38J6OIXUWWBWO	"""smallwaldo"""	Even though I have all the Stargate episodes on tape, having the DVDs is a lot of fun.  Not only is the quality better, but you can do fun things like zoom in on Daniel's diary in &quot;Fire and Water&quot; and go frame by frame through your favorite scenes.My one objection to the way the DVDs are handled is that there is no regular ratio format.  It's all letter boxed (16:9).  If I set my DVD player to t.v. aspect (3:4) I end up with 'squishy vision' as everything gets crammed in from the sides to fill the space.And as a collector of media, I have to say, the five CD box set takes up a heck of a lot less room than 11 video tapes.As for Stargate itself... most of it's been said in earlier reviews.  Witty writing, sharp acting, well developed plots...  And well... Michael Shanks.  Nuff said. &lt;g&gt;	5.0	DVDs are fun!	2001-08-11	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2ZMWGU610X3ZT	Solipso	The cinematography, set direction, and special effects fall short of the lavishness of the feature film that starred Kirk Russell and James Spader. I give STARGATE SG-1 five stars because I got no less than what I expected from a TV production. Also bare in mind that this series started in 1997. So the initial seasons will not look even as good as recent TV science fiction, like CAPRICA or THE FRINGE. Another caveat concerns plausibility. For the conquests they have achieved, the Goa'uld seem insufficiently advanced. I mean, it seems they could find a better default weapon than those unwieldy Jaffa staff weapons.But a dedicated science fiction fan should be able to rationalize away and revise seeming implausibilities. Otherwise he may have nothing to watch. I could have let faultfinding end my ten-season journey. Then I would have missed out on a saga with much storytelling that proved worthy of my time. The only BAD moments were those with the asinine comedy. Thank goodness they were few in number and were dispensed with by fast-forward.A DVD set has been released that includes all ten Stargate SG-1 seasons in one package. That is not what I am reviewing. From the reviews I read of that single package, I concluded that to buy that set would be a gamble. A number of buyers reported damaged, unplayable disks. So I bought all ten seasons separately, in the thinpak editions. Every disk played perfectly.	5.0	Good science fiction. Disks are in good condition.	2008-09-18	6	5	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2PWFDNPCS5JP8	StargateMom	Take a moment and explore the idea that there could be life in other parts of our galaxy and the reality of little gray men. Add in ancient Egyptian gods that really existed but were actually humans whose bodies were merely vessels for malevolent beings. These nasty beings were really snake like creatures bent on dominating the galaxy and enslaving all humankind. That is the premise behind the long-run, television series Stargate SG-1, created by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright (Stargate SG-1, 1997). The wildly popular series starred Richard Dean Anderson of MacGyver fame, as the lead character. Also starring with Anderson were Amanda Tapping, Michael Shanks and Christopher Judge as the members of SG-1, the lead heroes of the series. Stargate SG-1 is an adventure show for the family (ages 10+).As military science fiction, Stargate SG-1 focuses on the adventures of a team of four members of the United States Air Force who travel the galaxy, via wormholes created in space, in order to save transplanted humans from the wicked intentions of a slimy group of aliens called the Goa'uld. The team consists of Col. Jack O'Neill (career military ready for retirement), Captain Samantha Carter (brilliant and beautiful astrophysicist), Daniel Jackson (Egyptologist), and Teal'c (Jaffa defector). The team's missions are two-fold though, besides saving relocated humans they must also search for advanced technology that will help earth to defend itself against an imminent Goa'uld attack, all in a day's work.	5.0	Stargate SG-1	2010-11-28	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A31N0XY2UTB25C	Stephanie Sullivan	Most new television shows take a good piece of the first season for the actors to become comfortable and natural seeming in their roles. Star Trek TNG is a good example where the first season's acting was stiff and wooden.Not so much for Stargate SG-1. After the 2 part &#34;Children of the Gods&#34; established the premise of the series the actors are comfortable in their roles and the acting shows it. Of course the cast continues to evolve with the arc throughout the entire series. The first season stands out as one of the best first seasons I've seen.I find I also lament it was shot for the SD TV format which was well before HD formats were the norm. I accept it in the context of when it was produced.As a loyal SG-1 fan I have to give Season one 5 stars!	5.0	First Season that is a solid foundation for the series	2014-03-28	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	AYKUPTQCA9JHL	Susan K. York	A fan of originals, I have always enjoyed the Stargate movie, but was leery of any type of remake. I was pleasantly surprised with the tv series. The base storyline is a plausible continuation of the movie. And the introduction of new characters as well, as interesting developments of the established one, enhances the series.	5.0	In it's on right	2014-05-30	0	0	0
1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A25XBQ6HTOCNFM	S. Wallace	I like the way they blend our cultural myths with sci-fiction then throw in some science facts to make a really gripping series.

Running for ten seasons, you get to see the in-depth character development along with story lines to keep you interested. While CGI wasn't at its best at the time, they sure did use it to its full potential and improved as the years and seasons went by. If you are a syfy fan and you like a little drama with your action, tied to a story line of how Earth started &#34;exploring&#34; the galaxies secretly, this is the show for you!	5.0	Syfy at its best	2014-05-13	0	0	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A27FIL8Q9EX0SK	Tear 'Em Up Terry	The motion picture, Stargate, was a fun filled ride through an unknown world. It left us with questions though. SG-1 answers those questions. Then, it takes us on a fun filled ride through the universe, literally.Richard Dean Anderson's portrayal of O'Neil is an understatement in humor in the face of danger.  Amanda Tapping portrays Samantha Carter. A scientist serving in the U.S. Air Force. I love smart women. Carter is all that, and a bag of degrees. Not too mention, easy on the eyes. Daniel Jackson is masterfully portrayed by Michael Shanks. We find out later on, he thinks Jackson is a bleeding heart liberal. Which shows the depths of Shanks commitment to the part. And, last, but most certainly not least, Christopher Judge as Teal'c. Every good science fiction show needs an alien that is learning about us as much as they learn about themselves. Teal'c does that with depth and subtle humor.Two very enthusiastic thumbs up from me.	5.0	What the movie lacked, this series makes up.	2013-09-05	0	0	0

Col O'neill's part was played a little too laid back, but it was very entertaining.The only real stretch (which non-military would not pick up on) was that as AF personnel, they represented Special Forces soldiers....though AFSOC does have a very capable program, it is not built around the same tactics or techniques that USASFC employs.  But that is a VERY VERY minor flaw in an increadibly well written, well choreographed and well acted show.  Easy to see why it went so many seasons.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A3L5XAPBLPO4FN	"""tloveman"""	Not being a suscriber of Showtime, I've had to deal with absurd syndication scheduling (4 p.m on Saturday on week then 3 p.m. on Sunday the next.) to see this series.  Before getting this DVD set, I hadn't a clue which episodes I'd seen or if I'd seen in the correct order.  As it turns out, even as a current big fan, I hadn't seen at last 60% of the first season.  So it was a true delight to watch them all in rapid successes, with perfect picture and sound, no commercials, and the widescreen format.  I'm chopping at the bit waiting for the subsequent seasons to arrive on DVD.  Besides the quality and convenience of the DVD set, this TV series is actually more like watching one-long 20 hour movie.  I couldn't wait for the next episode and then was kind of sad when I reach the last disk.In the spirit of Star Trek, our intrepid group of Stargate explorers go, in our time, where no one has gone before.  They truly bring great depth and meaning to their adventures and touch on contemporary subjects, deal with real personal issues and emotions, and have a wild-time getting there.	5.0	The only way to watch TV is on DVD	2001-10-04	25	23	2

But before Stargate, my previous attempts at finding a sci-fi series besides Star Trek that would keep me watching left me thinking that Trek might be the only really good stuff out there.Then I found this show in syndication.  Within a few episodes, I realized most of the things that I would eventually say make this show great.  The technology level of the show's Earth characters begins very much like that of ours in real life - no spaceships, no phasers, just terrestrial tech plus the newly-discovered round thing from ancient times that lets them explore the galaxy.  Add to that great writing, great acting, great humor, great special effects, subject matters ranging from military to anthropology that never get headdy, and a star character so deep and refreshing that his character could make up for a weak surrounding ensemble if it had to (but believe me, there's no need, the other characters are great too), and you have what has become my favorite television series of all time.	5.0	ancient human history meets over-the-top evil aliens	2004-03-29	4	4	0

If you are wondering if you should spend the bones for the collection, IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT!! I missed most of the first season, so it was a real treat watching them one by one each night. There are about 8 episodes on each disc, along with the initial 2-hour season premier. THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY SCI-FI LOVER and will be well worth the price you paid. Once you get the set it will leave you asking only one question:  WHEN IS THE SECOND SEASON COLLECTION COMING OUT!? The cliff hanger from the first season is intense and you will be craving MORE!	5.0	Can't decide to spend the dough? Read this!	2001-10-09	3	3	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2G8IR6ENZSQHF	"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy"""	"Ten years after this series premiered, I am only now finally beginning to watch ""Stargate SG-1.""  I had always liked the 1994 movie, but never really thought that it needed continuation, and beginning watching this season only after I promised a friend I would give it a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.  I have not seen any further ""SG1"" seasons yet, so forgive me if I don't know where stuff is going yet (I plan on starting Season Two soon).The first episode is a direct sequel to the 1994 film.  It turns out that Ra wasn't the only powerful alien out to enslave humanity, and another one (named Apophis) has arrived to kidnap humans to serve as hosts for this evil race (given the name of the Goa'uld).  In the first episode, the Goa'uld kidnap loved ones of Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson from the first movie-- Jack's friend and Daniel's wife-- and possess them.  The rest of the season concerns the ""Stargate team"" SG-1's attempts to track down Apophis so those two can rescue their loved ones, but of course, this being a TV series, this main plot is deviated from quite a bit (for better and worse).  O'Neill and Jackson are joined on SG-1 by the brilliant Samantha Carter, and the alien Teal'c, a former Apophis servant who's betrayed his master to help the people of Earth.Apparently this season has a bad reputation amongst ""Stargate"" fans who enjoy the better seasons to come, but I found this to be a very effective introduction.  Since it's the first season, many episodes focus on developing the team, and make them more empathetic to the audience.  For example, O'Neill has unfinished business with his dead son that haunts him (shown in ""Cold Lazarus""), and Jackson continually laments the loss of his wife (most notably in ""Thor's Hammer"" and ""Fire and Water"").  We also get to see the soft sides of the normally hard-headed Carter (in ""Singularity"") and the normally emotionless Teal'c (in ""Bloodlines"" and ""Cor-Ai""), and Teal'c in particular is haunted by the crimes he committed while serving Apophis.Of course, character development aside, the show is best watched for the action and adventure, and this season often delivers.  The first episode ""Children of the Gods"" serves as an effective bridge between the movie and show (although those with a weak stomach should take note-- the Goa'uld possession scenes are graphic from both a nudity sense and a grotesque sense).  ""Thor's Hammer"" is probably the most vivid and satisfying episode of the season; not only does it have great character development, but it also introduces a cool new race (the Norse) and a terrifying villain in the form of Unas, who's voiced by no less than the God of movie villain voices, James Earl Jones.  ""The Torment of Tantalus"" introduces cool arcs for both Jackson and Catherine, a minor character from the ""Stargate"" movie.  ""The Nox"" and ""Bloodlines"" are first-rate action episodes.  ""There But For the Grace of God"" is a cool new twist on the old ""alternate universe"" sci-fi clich&eacute;.  And ""Within the Serpent's Grasp"" is a great cliffhanger that effectively sets up Season Two, which I can't wait to start.Between these great episodes, we get the expected groaners as well.  ""Emancipation"" is both pointless and an unfortunate throwback to the old ""colored tribe demands white woman"" stereotype.  ""Hathor""-- with its ""sexy alien woman seduces the men and the women have to kick ass"" plotline-- is silly fun, but also contains some unfortunate out-of-character moments and uncomfortable subtexts (why isn't Jackson more upset that he's helped to create more of the race that he wants to wipe out, even if he ""wasn't himself"" at the time?)  ""Politics"" is a notorious ""flashback"" episode, although it introduces some delicious human villains into the series.  ""Tin Man"" is an annoying play on Asimov, even if it has a cool twist at the end.  Overall, the season borrows quite a bit from Star Trek (Examples: virus that ages people rapidly, aliens possessing humans, unstable body doubles being created, God-like aliens shaking their heads at the silly antics of humans and their enemies), although this can be forgiven with the argument that Star Trek's been around so long it's probably done everything possible in sci-fi.  Apophis, although scary in the first episode, seems to get more campy as the season goes along.  Finally, O'Neill makes a decision at the end of the final episode that's a bit head-scratching (wasn't there a way to disable that person without killing him?)In spite of its flaws, the first season of ""Stargate SG-1"" is great fun, and recommended to all sci-fi fans.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A18AEM147GGN4O	ViciousCritic	As a science fiction show that doesn't use a lot of modern technology, this show will probably be a timeless classic. Of all of the movies and tv series of the Stargate franchise, it's the most watched and has the largest cult following.Totally Socks just did a parody of this show, where all of the characters were sock puppets. It just show that even 5 years after the show ended, it's still relevant.For me, Jack (Richard Dean Anderson) and Carter (Amanda Tapping) make the show, while the other characters provide the necessary balance.	5.0	Stargate is an enduring classic	2012-09-01	0	0	0

Villines ""WJ Villines"""	"Note this review is for the SG-1 Children of the Gods for Instant/Prime Video via amazon, and not the dvd version (though I will do a little comparison of the two).In Children of the Gods Part 1 (the two parts are actually connected as one Pilot Movie on the DVD disks) it is not as visually percieveable that there are significant edits to the Prime Streaming version -- there is infact some cutting from the original film in part one only for the ""fit for time allotted on broadcast TV""In Children of the Gods Part 2 there are blatant cuts as the original pilot version as available on the DVD set for Season 1 has scenes of women nude but not in a sexual context at any point.I am a person who does not like sex scenes in movies or tv shows that do not actually drive the plot any but when the movie or tv show has them included, I do not believe that it should ever be ""edited for TV"" -- if it can't be shown as is, then it should not be shown in the first place.I expect the rest of season to be unedited as no other episode has any problems with inclusions of what should not be included for tv. But, if you are thinking of buying this episode via Instant Video from Amazon -- you would be better off buying the full disk set if you want the original remake of the season 1 stuff. If you can put up with the edits or if you are on the Prime Membership with these episodes available at no extra cost, then watch it as it anchors the rest of the series.I am still waiting for the Original Showtime episodes as they have a distinctly different storyline than what these disks and SciFy channel's take-over of the series produced and was not able to go past one or two seasons via showtime. But like the Six Million Dollar Man (really worth getting the disk sets) the original Showtime version of SG-1 seams to be lost."	2.0	SG-1 Pilot Episode Review: Children of the Gods on Amazon Prime	2012-12-07	4	3	1

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2SSTI6FF8YNEJ	W. Condo	Without a doubt, this is one of the best sci-fi series ever made.  I was surprised when I found it on DVD and even more suprised with the quality of the DVD.  I had only ever seen this series in syndication, with all the commercials.  Having them on DVD without commercials is great!  My only complaint, and its so minor that it doesn't take away from the 5-star rating, is that I wish the audio was in something a little better than 2 speaker stereo.  The show is a little too old for Dolby 5.1 but I think 3.2 would have sounded great.  Perhaps the newer seasons will be in something better.  I only hope they will be released on DVD too.	5.0	One of the best sci-fi series ever!  The perfect collection!	2001-08-05	2	2	0

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A2Y2OXNSSK94M9	Williams	"My friends have been telling me to watch this show for ages.  It was one of those ""when I have time"" things.  I love sci-fi, but I missed the first couple of seasons and never felt the urge to buy the DVD collections.  I don't like starting a series in the middle, so I just never watched it.  One day, I realized I could stream it for free with Prime, so I gave it a shot.Everyone who told me to watch it was right.  It's a really good show.  It is sci-fi, but it's so character-driven that even those who aren't ""into sci-fi"" would probably enjoy it.  This is not a show where the endings are always happy and problems have simple solutions.  Sometimes, characters you really like die and characters you truly hate thrive.  That's part of the charm.  The audience is never able to assume things will work out a certain way or get too comfortable with the safety of the characters...however outlandish the premise may seem, it feels real."	5.0	Stargate SG-1	2013-08-23	0	0	0

This, though, is definitely not my favorite season, mainly because of special effects-but it was good the first time through. If you are buying all of the season box sets of this show, then get it-but if you are only buying select sets, then get another season, unless you want to know some back story. The best episodes of the season are: Children of the Gods, Thor's Hammer, Solitudes, Tin Man, The Torment of Tantalus, There But For the Grace of God, and Within the Serpent's Grasp.	5.0	Fairly Good Season	2006-04-18	0	0	0

To be on TV for a decade and spin off several movies is difficult in any genre, but to do it in the SciFi world is nigh impossible.

1424819253	Stargate SG-1 - Season 1	A27FGK91Z6N8HL	W. J. Moran	Stargate SG-1 is a superb example of what SciFi should be.  The series (aired on Showtime) developed an outstanding concept first presented in the movie Stargate, which stared Kurt Russell.  I have to say that Richard Dean Anderson was a brilliant choice to fill the role vacated by Russell.  The stories are extremely well written and the performances by all of the cast members shows TV at its finest.  Backed with imaginative and exciting special effects, this is a series that will be popular for years to come.  Although saddened that it is in its last season, I was overjoyed when the first season was released to DVD.  I hope that all remaining seasons will follow suit.
