B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A5B711Y547WHH	"A. Crawford ""Bcherwurm"""	After receiving one of these chain e-mails that contained a snippet of Dunham's performance, of whom I had never heard before, I had to see more and bought this DVD.OH MY GOD! It is absolutely hilarious. My favorite character is Peanut and he has coined quite a few phrases that seem to fit certain life situations and have the power to lighten up my day. I have watched this performance numerous times and I still lose myself every time. Walter, Jos&eacute; and Bubba J. are very funny as well, but cannot quite reach Peanut's performance and appearance (I mean there are women that would kill for those lips).I can't say I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys a good stand up comedy with a twist, since I don't know what may tickle you funny bone, but I would recommend it to myself any day.	5.0	It's the lotion ...	2008-01-06	1	1	0

If it's GREAT, like this one is, I would have to resort to the overwhelming non-lack of cliches plastered on the covers of movie boxes and posters across the Land.What it boils down to, is this (and its very simple): This is one of the funniest and most tallented stand-up acts I have ever seen. You have your all-time greats like Pryor and (fill in your fav here) but did they hold three-way conversations at lightning speed and legibly conveying three unique voices with three different personalities? Either he has incredible tallent or he's related to Emily Rose.In short, its fantastic - Excellent - pullamuscle funny - and man does it deliver.

One of the funniest comedians to come along in years. The best thing about Jeff Dunham is that unlike comedians like Dane Cook and Ron White and even politically incorrect comedians like Dennise Miller: Jeff Dunham actually makes you LAUGH! His comedy, even when talking about social and political issues is presented in a light-hearted way as not to be ""We're all F&$#ed"" but rather ""This is Funny"". With Walter and Peanut and the other characters you get conversational comedy which makes it more enjoyable than just a 90 minute monologue. FUNNY AS HELL!"	5.0	Simply: The Best.	2009-01-11	0	0	0

The guy somehow gets away with ripping on every racial group and is never called out on it because he uses puppets I guess? I heard a lot about this guy and decided to watch this specific special on Comedy Central. It's effing horrible! None of the jokes or impersonations are that great or funny. I let out maybe one or two ""ha!'s"" during the whole thing. Not a laugh, just a ""ha!"", like ""Wow, this guy is so bad!"".Everyone seems to love the ""Dead Terrorist"" character who just says ""I kill you!"" over and over. It's not funny. I wonder what the families of 9/11 and those overseas fighting for us in Afghanistan and Iraq think about that garbage. His redneck and grumpy white guy characters are also just as lame and unfunny. If I wanted to see rednecks, I'd just watch Larry the Cable Guy. Hell, I thought that the Blue Collar Guys weren't that funny, but compared to Jeff Dunham, they are great. If I wanted to see an old guy grumble and make lewd comments, I'd just go visit my own Grandpa. He's 100 times funnier than Jeff Dunham's puppet.I heard a lot of hype about this guy, only to find out that he is a complete unfunny nerd. Maybe it's accepted widely as ""Family Comedy"" because there is not really much use of profanity, but I think that promoting every sort of racial stereotype out there with these puppets is far more offensive than the dirtiest joke, an hour of curse words and anything that Howard Stern has ever said on the radio that ""Christians"" and the FCC found so offensive."	1.0	Lame.

Though, honestly, I never had a chance to see any of his shows til more recently on several TV shows on TV. When I saw this first DVD, I was curious to buy it just to see how well he does in his shows. Besides, you hardly ever see DVDs of Ventriloquists performing unless they are independently done and sold & those, my friend, are hard to come by(your normal everyday joe doesn't go to alot of comedy shows). If you do see DVDs of Ventrilquists, it's usually geared more towards kids(like ""The Shari Show"" with Shari Lewis, ""Zoey's Wild Things"" with Mallory Lewis-both of which I recommend for the younger set- or something in that vein).  Up until recently; my favorite Ventriloquists were Edgar Bergen, Jimmy Nelson, Shari Lewis, and a couple more closer to my age...Mark Wade & Jay Johnson(Star of the old comedy series, ""Soap""). After seeing this DVD, I'm proud to add Jeff to the list. I tell you, I never laughed so hard for so long in my life. In this DVD, you meet Walter(a wisecracking old man who bellyaches about almost everything), Sweet Daddy D(Jeff's blunt but hilarious agent), Bubba J(a slow but surprising funny NASCAR nut)  Peanut(a wacky wacky youngster from the Micronesian Islands), and Jose the Jalapeno(a Jalapeno from Mexico- on a steeeeeek! What more can be said there..). Performing stand-up comedy with his pals, Jeff is at his peak with this show. If you don't get any other Jeff Dunham DVD, get this one.

I watch it a lot. His ability and talent are outstanding, but the characters he has created are unforgettable.  It was obvious by audience reaction that MANY others love ""Peanut"" as much as I do, and ""Walter"" is another character I love.

""Jeff Dunham-Arguing with Myself"" DVD does just that. Street crime, wars, economy miseries blare out of our TV's with such regularity, we have no recourse but to feel miserable about life, So why not put this in your DVD player and get away from it all for awhile. Does the heart good.I watched this hilarious DVD while my daughter was visiting us, back in 2008. My husband and I thought this was one of the most uproariously, hilarious ventriloquist acts we've ever seen. So, after discussing the many Christmas gift choices, we had, due to our financial situation, I decided to buy this DVD for my friends, who live in another state. I was concerned it may be a little too risque for my girlfriend, but, as it turned out, she loves it. She just could not stop raving about how she and her husband, and friends they have shared it with, absolutely think it is the best time they have had in a long time and has brought both of them many hours of enjoyment.This DVD was inexpensive and I loved that I could have it sent to their home. It arrived in time for Christmas besides. Sadly, I don't own the DVD myself.... yet. I intend on purchasing all of Jeff's DVD's, in the near future, so we can enjoy them and share them with our friends, too.Every time I call my friend, she tells me how her friends have, now, bought their own DVD so they can watch it anytime they want.Jeff Dunham presents his marionettes, in such a way, they all seem real, although we know they aren't. His ventriloquism, talent shines through with Arthur, Peanut, Achmed, and Jalapeno on a Stick. I love Arthur, even though he is a super grump and is always complaining about everything, from his wife, whom we never see, to every day life's common events. Peanut is my favorite since he is always giving Jeff and Jalapeno on a Stick a rough time. With his yellow tuff, of hair,  and his purple body, and his ear to ear mouth, he is so much fun to watch. This is, especially, when he puts his head back, laughing at something he got over on Jeff. Achmed's, ""I will kill you,"" every few minutes, adds irony to the fact that he doesn't even realize he is dead and can't kill anyone. All of the characters are so different from each other, and Jeff moves from one in such a smooth transition, there is never a boring moment from beginning to end in this DVD.Bring out the popcorn, and other tasty eats and drinks, put in ""Jeff Dunham-Arguing with Myself,"" or any of his other DVD's and get ready to enjoy a couple of hours of getting away from the world and your troubles. If you want a good laugh or are looking for the ideal gifts, get this DVD or one of Jeff's other DVD's (Heck! Why not buy a whole set for yourself and or your friends and families?

Later, I mentioned him to a friend of mine who then clued me in to his name. I caught some of his clips on YouTube then, and then ordered his DVDs. I've horse-laughed over his work ever since. He has to be the greatest ventriloquist I've ever seen perform. My personal favorite charactor is Walter. He reminds me of WAY too many people I've known in my life. Peanut is a very close second. Some may find the entire concepts of Bubba J and Sweet Daddy D offensive, but they're funny, too. Mr. Dunham's technique and ability is truly amazing. His ability to carry on an entire conversation between three diferent charactors, high-speed style, is astounding. I hope to catch Jeff Dunham live some day, as he is just too funny for words, even his stand-up routine at the beginning, minus the puppets, is hilarious!

His ""characters"" are mostly based on blatant stereotypes that are immediately offensive to anyone with any sort of empathy towards the feelings of others.  These are not clever jokes based on the differences of diverse cultures.  These are insulting caricatures on the same level as black face or buck toothed ""ching chong ding dong"" characters. I was shocked to discover that something this tasteless existed in the new millennium, let alone that a talentless ""comic"" could hide his inability to tell jokes behind this disgusting display.

After picking up this DVD, it was apparent what I had missed all these years. After about twenty viewings of Arguing With Myself, the DVD still makes me laugh. Almost everything on this DVD is side-splittingly hilarious, and there is the option to view it with or without the naughty language. It's apparent that Jeff has taken great time and effort to give his characters separate and distinct personalities, so that none of the characters seem even vaguely alike, answering the same questions very differently. However, The shots of Sweet Daddy D (with annoying voice-overs) are the only bad point on this DVD. Fortunately, after Sweet Daddy D has his time on stage, we do not have to see any more of him until the closing credits, which gives us the chance to see and hear the wonderful insanity of Peanut, and the interplay between Peanut and Jose Jalapeno. Great stuff.	4.0	Good God, this is funny!	2008-06-28	0	0	0

"Some people think ventriloquists are cute or novel, but they would never actually want to go to a show with one. It's time to reevaluate your love of puppets, or not.I've seen a few of Jeff's acts and he's funny on his own. Add in some interesting characters and turn Jeff into the straight man and not your talking. This DVD is full of his best stuff:Walter - ""Shut the hell up!"" Funny, insulting, jerk of an old man who Jeff continually apologizes for.Peanut - ""Nnneeyroww!"" The funniest part of the show. It almost seems like he's improvising the whole thing as he goes.Jose Jalepeno - ""On a steek."" The banter between him and Peanut is priceless.Bubba J - I think this guy was made to cash in on the Blue Collar Comedy hype. Funny, but not Jeff's best work.Sweet Daddy Dee - Also meant to cash in on the Kings of comedy tour. Funny, but not to die for. He also makes commentary throughout the DVD which was entirely unnecessary.Bloopers - I was at the second show and he picked the best of the improve stuff, but I wish he had put it all in. He never is out of character. Never.So to sum up: Jeff is brilliantly hilarious. Walter, Peanut & Jose are funny. Bubba & Sweet are not. Bloopers are worth it.

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A31XO0Q8LJ3ZJ0	"James A. Wilson ""cmwmlw"""	Jeff Dunham's ventriloquism is astounding. He can do different voices, accents and pitch without missing a beat. The puppets mannerisms are so realistic you almost forget they're not alive. His stage presence and fluid delivery show a distinct polish -- he's obviously been doing this for a very long time.He's also quiet good with ad-libbing. During one sequence a member of the audience tries to sneak out and use the rest room. Jeff catches this and incorporates that into his routine, doing so in such a seamless manner as to almost appear rehearsed (which I don't believe it really was). And that bit of improvisation turns about to be some of the funniest stuff he does.There is a bit of a slow period during the middle, when he does a pimp and a redneck character. Neither of those were as funny as the rest of his stuff, but other then that Jeff Dunham scores big. Definitely worth the money!	4.0	An amazing talent	2007-01-15	0	0	0

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A2WMMLTW6QVM01	Joe	** SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT FOR THE LAST PARAGRAPH **I saw this on Comedy Central and it was funny. I heard that this one was uncut, and since I needed something to bring my amazon cart up to free shipping, gave this a shot. There were quite a few things I either didn't notice before, or was cut on the TV version. The timing on the jokes were definitely better on the DVD.I had problems playing this DVD on PowerDVD using an SPDIF. Switching PowerDVD to stereo fixed it so that I can watch it. Not a huge problem since a comedy show isn't exactly Star Wars.Overall, this was hilarious, much more than I expected. I bought a few other DVDs of comedy routines but not that much material was cut compared to what was on Comedy Central. This DVD had a good amount of cut material, and it isn't like the cut material from a lot of (non-comedy) DVDs I've rented (which usually deserved to be cut). This stuff is good.The menus were horrible. You select an option and there'd be audio and it'd take a while for it to run through. However, it's only a one-time deal before watching the DVD, so it wasn't bad overall (except in my case with the PowerDVD issue where I tried to debug the audio).There were Sweet Daddy Dee moments popping in on the act and commenting. It wasn't that funny, but just keep watching the rest of the video because it's worth it. It happens a lot less over the length of the video.	4.0	Hilarious, but a mite buggy	2007-01-17	0	0	0

The opening scenes showcase Dunham's talent as a pure stand-up comedian, then the puppets join him and they bring the show to a whole new level of insane comedy - and bring the house down in the process. From the cantankerous Walter to the smooth Sweet Daddy D, every character is unique both in sound and ""personality"". For me the highlight was the scene where Peanut and Jose talk in Spanish and Jeff protests that he feels left out because he ""doesn't speak Spanish"" - the line is great, the comedic timing is exquisite.

I first saw Jeff Dunham on one of the talk shows years ago and I remembered Jeff's 3 main stars, Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalepeno (On A Steek). I remember praying that I would get a chance to see this great ventriloquist again and finally my prayer's are answered. After years of getting laughs from vulgarity riddled standups from the likes of Red Foxx, Eddie Murphy, and Andrew Dice Clay, I finally can have a stand up comedy that is hilarious and I can watch with my children.In this standup, Jeff introduces 2 new friends, Bubba J and Sweet Daddy Dee who are as funny as  the other 3. Bubba is a bucktoothed,beer belly redneck who is hysterically strereotyped as such, Sweet Daddy Dee is Jeffs new manager who insists he's Jeff's pimp. Though both new characters are hysterical, Walter (the grouchy old man) and Peanut (you would swear he's on speed), and Jose Jalapeno(On A Steek)are still my favorites.One of the greatest strengths of Jeff is his ability to bring forth totally different personalities as if 5 different comedians are voicing for each. Jeff jokes are funny and best of all, done in good taste.All I can say to anyone who's not interested in this video is ""Your Loss"".

The banter is funny but gets old after awhile.Also, beware if you have preteen/young teenaged children.  There is a ""clean"" side and a not-so-clean side.  We watched the clean side but found it had a lot of language that would at least make it a PG-13 if it were rated (maybe even an R rating).

There is a word of caution though, the unbleeped version can be a little bit much for the younger members of the family. The bleeped version is still pretty much a PG-13 or PG rating and it is not recommended for young children. Jeff and his family of characters will have you crying from laughing so hard that it makes your sides hurt and you can't breathe.

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A214DG8Y09M3W9	"Michelle Devon ""~~Professional Dreamer"""	Walter, the old codger, is one of Jeff Dunham's buddies/dolls in the show. I love his facial expressions and gestures more than any of the others. I can almost forget he's just a doll, he's so accurately real for an old codger. He is definitely politically incorrect in the funniest way. I love Walter and he gave me several chuckles in this show, particularly with the improv stuff he does with the audience.I also like Jose. Sure, he's a bit 'stereotypical', but then again, I think that's the point of him too. When Jeff Dunham gets to going with two, three or four of the dolls at once, it is quite impressive... on a steeeeeek.Peanut is okay. He's funny, but he's a bit odd. I like Bubba J. But Sweet Daddy doesn't do it for me. I didn't mind the standup routine with Sweet Daddy, but I really disliked the commentary in the green room and the 'pimping' with the girls and stuff that wasn't part of the stage show. It wasn't really necessary and it wasn't really all that funny either. It was definitely racist and overtly stereotypical of a very negative type.I would have given the show a five if it had made me laugh out loud a bit more and if Sweet Daddy wasn't part of the act. Even with these things, Dunham is talented and he has a good show. He uses a little bit of crude language, but it's not really excessive, and there are some sexual innuendo, but nothing super graphic. It's mostly a humorous, clean show, with just enough edge to be 'adult' or 'grown up'. Dunham is expert at making you forget he's a ventriloquist and the cameras get good angles on the dolls to make them seem more realistic.All in all, it was a good way to spend an evening chuckling at some silly jokes and enjoying Dunham's talent. I will definitely recommend it and will watch other Dunham shows.	4.0	Wasn't Laughing Out Loud, But Smiled Throughout	2011-11-06	1	1	0

When Jeff Dunham first came on stage and started telling an airport security story, I didn't really think he was that funny. Later in the show when he brings out his cast of characters, he tied things in from the initial story and then the laughs began to flow. His puppets are are given so much personality by his voice and the way he moves the mouths and bodies, they seem like they are alive. He also has the unique ability to improvise with the audience as the puppet and as himself.

I was born in Cuba, and I am way beyond that ""politically correct cr@@p"". Although I would suggest one thing: next time any guy out there talks about us Cubans, please remember two things: 1) No, we DO NOT consume chili, jalapenos or whatever (that is a MEXICAN custom, not Cuban) and 2) We have no idea back in Cuba what a taco is. In fact, that for us, means a completely different thing; and a tortilla for us is an omelet, not some floury thing that, by the way, we again DO NOT know anything about back there.

Jeff's quick wit and willingness to be upstaged by his subjects makes for much entertainment.  He is very clever, and has the puppets play off of things throughout the show.  We have decided that it would be cool to see him in person as he involves his audience with much hilarity.We have watched the DVD a few times since receiving it, and it's currently on loan to a friend at work.

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A1L6LLBT5B2JKX	Robert Gnarley	It is a shame, truly a shame that this man's 'act' deserves one single special, let alone four.  This man is a ridiculously unfunny hack relying on only the most played out stereotypes and overtly stupid material.  I am sure that if he could make anyone laugh without a puppet in his hand he would, just as if most children's book writers would write for adults if they could.  This is pandering garbage, pure and simple.  Anyone with just an average intelligence (which is dropping all the time it would seem) knows beyond the shadow of a doubt that this is unfunny drivel.  The fact that anyone could enjoy this is absurd to me, yet I know that so many do.Does anyone else remember his short lived television show? Would anyone care to tell me why such a funny comedian couldn't hack it for one entire season before being canned?  That is proof positive that at least some segment of the population still has enough sense to change the channel when they see some moron with a doll up on stage... a glimmering hope for America which is slowly receding into the distance.  Please, I am begging anyone who agrees with me to give this 1 star.  Help me make it clear that we still have a collective sense of humor beyond goofy voices and thinly veiled racism.  If you will excuse me, I have to go now because someone is jingling keys over my head and I need to laugh and smack at it like a cat.	1.0	The Stupification of the Masses	2012-06-25	11	3	8

I found him quite amusing, and I still do, but with at least one caveat: he tries too hard these days to inject his political axe-grinding into the act. Rather like Drew Carey and the creators of South Park -- two other right-wing comedians who are actually funny when they stick to comedy -- he apparently thinks he's accumulated enough of a following that he should now use his clout to promote the cause. (See the dead terrorist skit and the Prius/Hummer one.) They really aren't funny and are pretty ineffective; those who praise those two skits can't be doing so on comedic merits, because those skits have almost none. It's a pity, really, because when Dunham sticks to comedy, he's really pretty talented (see the opening monologue about the puppet and the airport screeners, as well as the ones about Bubba and his wife -- ""Where'd you meet her? At the family reunion"" -- as well as almost everything on here (Walter and the ""menstrual cycle"" is very amusing) except the pimp bit, which was rather forced. Dude... you're a comedian.

The few minutes at the start before the first puppet comes to life is average stand-up at most, but once the puppetskick in JD shines in his performance up to the end.The DVD contains a live stage show at Santa Ana that was very well shot and directed, with very good sound and picture quality.I've reduced a star for the DVD production because of:A. The total lack of subtitles. I think that a product that is aimed at such a wide audience must come with subtitles, and this should be a basic feature of every DVD, especially one that (as stated on th back of this one)pertains to ""...set the new standard for how truly awesome a comedy DVD can be."" Some titles go as far as having subtitles for the commentary track which is really great.B. There seems to be a problem with 2 bonus clips, that appear on the menu but fail to play, no matter what playback option I tried. (any comment on that would be appreciated - maybe I missed how to play it)Regarding the other extras:There are two nice outtakes with a short commentary track, running around 3 minutes each.There's also a full feature audio commentary track that is well worth hearing. It has JD (+ Walter) and Kelly Ashbury (Author of Dummy Days and co-director of Shrek 2) having a fluent free conversation about ventriloquism at general and of JD's career and show in particular.That is, of course, if you're not offended by Walter's remark at the beginning of the commentary:""...If the folks are actually listening to this audio commentary..you have no life at this point, wouldn't that be about the truth,if you have enough time to sit down and listen to this crap..""Bottom line - highly recommended if you like good non-PC comedy and have an affection to this fascinating form of art."	4.0	A welcome boost to a fascinating endangered art form.	2012-10-07	0	0	0

His material is very funny except when it becomes lewd.  Fortunately there are bleeped and unbleeped versions, which protect those with sensitive ears from frequent use of the f word.  However, the sexual jokes are not bleeped, so the DVD is unfortunately unsuitable for families with young children. It's too bad, because much of his humor would appeal to audiences of all ages. It is unrated, but it should have an R rating because of language and sexual humor.	4.0	Arguing With Myself	2007-05-17	0	0	0

I laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it, if not more.  Each time I pick up details that I didn't see before when I watched.  The material is extremely funny.  His interaction with the various dummies brings them alive.  They each have individual mannerisms and I forget that they are inanimate objects.  This is especially true when he has Peanut and Jose Jalape&ntilde;o on a Stick having a conversation and arguing with each other.  Jose is complaining to Jeff and Peanut is laughing to himself over what he did to Jose at the same time. The talent it takes to switch back and forth between characters, accents and mannerisms and make it believable is pure artistry!

He's funny and each of his characters has a distinct personality that plays so well off of Dunham's straight man act. Peanut, Walter, and the rest interact with the audience and Dunham is very fast on his feet and with his vocal cords.Obviously I'm a fan.  I've followed his work since the 90s when he would appear on the Comic Strip TV show and have seen a number of his Comedy Central specials.  The only low point in this routine is the introduction of a new character, Sweet Daddy, as Dunham's manager otherwise it's a great set that will have you laughing for hours.	5.0	Jeff Dunham, Peanut, & Walter Rock	2007-12-26	4	4	0

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A2BU77RJTUJ5CD	"Tech Guy ""Hal"""	I've seen Jeff in concert at least 6 or 7 times before, and he's funny everytime. If you've seen him in concert before in the last year or two, about half of what you see on this DVD is new and about half is material you've seen before, but that doesn't matter--stuff this funny can be seen over and over and you'll still laugh. A word of caution to parents, though: Jeff's characters look warm and fuzzy, and to be honest, compared to many contemporary comedians Jeff is really clean, but his stuff is NOT apporpriate for the youngest members of the family. True, there's a bleeped and non-bleeped version on this DVD, and the bleeped version is a definite R, but the non-bleeped version is still PG or PG-13. Just keep that in mind.By the way, someone mentioned earlier that he couldn't find Jeff's concert information at Ticketmaster.

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A38YZO2P7L3EMG	T S	Jeff Dunham is a ventriloquist that has a few comedy specials on dvd. This was the first of those and it was the introduction for Sweet Daddy Dee. His other dummies on this dvd are Walter, Bubba J, Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno on a stick. If this is the first time you are watching this special, you will be laughing a lot. Most likely through the entire thing. The beginning of this dvd comes with an edited and unedited option. The difference between the two is that the edited option beeps out the curse words. There are a couple of special features on this dvd such as a couple of outtakes and a commentary with Jeff Dunham.	5.0	Very Funny	2013-10-01	0	0	0

You know the kinda laugh where you can't breathe, tears are rolling down your face, your belly  is aching. I first saw Jeff Dunham on Comedy Central and just had to see the whole video.  If you've seen him there, don't think you've seen the video, there are a lot of good things that they cut out on Comedy Central so they can fit it in the time slot with commercials. It's well worth getting the video. Jeff is so good that you forget that he's the one making the voices for all the puppets. And don't miss the out takes, first listen to the commentary on them so you know what's going on, then watch without it, it's hysterical!	5.0	Laughed so hard it hurt!	2008-02-27	0	0	0

No matter how many times I watch these shows, I never get through them without laughing out loud.  They are a great stress reliever on those days when I have had a very trying day at work. I just come home, turn on one of his DVDs and before I know it, I have forgotten all about my crazy day.  He brings such life to these puppets that you forget they ARE puppets.  The have a life of their own and you look at them as if they are real!

He bounces from his own voice to the dummies' voices in lightning speed and does it brilliantly.  The personalities he has created for each character shine through; it's easy to forget they're not real!  This is one of the few DVD's I can watch repeatedly and still laugh like it's the first time I've seen it.  The bonus features, though long, are quite interesting.  I've been a fan of his for years and knew some background on his oldest characters, but there was still a lot of information that was new, interesting and enjoyable to hear.  Overall, listening to Jeff discuss ""behind the scenes"" is entertaining.  This is a DVD that every fan of comedy must have.

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A38X2PBTAJ082H	Victor M. Passenheim	He's a great ventriloquist and he's funny to boot! You will laugh your butt off with this video.  I think what Jeff does best is switch so seamlessly between characters - whether that be the puppets or himself.  He does that at the drop of a hat - changes voice, pitch, mood - you name it, and so quickly, too.  It is truly uncanny.  He is the consummate professional.  Does 8 different puppets- characters, 9 if you include the puppet master.  My favorite is Walter.  Walter for President!  Anyway, if you buy this DVD, be warned - this material is NOT for children - adult content only (I would label it TV 14).  There is a bleeped version, but let's just say that even that version leaves little to the imagination.	5.0	Dunham Rules!	2007-11-10	0	0	0

B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A2C12KK9DONYJD	"W. Costa ""a.k.a. 'BC'"""	This DVD features both the bleeped and un-bleeped recordings ofthis performance.  The bleeped version is of course what has beenaired on TV.  Both versions of this performance on DVD alsoinclude some additional scenes that were spliced into thetelevised version.  In my not so humble opinion, these added bitsdidn't add much that was actually laugh-out-loud funny.The commentary track is a mixed bag.  Overall it seems a bitamateurish.  There is some interesting information about howDunham came to create his characters, stories about some of hisearly experiences, and a few observations about the performancefeatured.  But the commentary is uneven and is poorly recorded.On the other hand the included out-takes, and the bonus snippetof Peanut's encounter with the family dog are very funny, sothere is at least a few 'extras' that are more than just filleron the DVD.Bottom Line: If you have never seen this on TV, then all thesecarps are immaterial since the performance itself is very veryfunny and well worth watching and having.  Or even if you haveseen this on TV, you'll no doubt enjoy watching this performanceagain and having the opportunity to share it with friends.  Butif you're buying this with the expectation that you're going toget a *lot* more funny material beyond what you saw on TV, you'reprobably going to be somewhat disappointed.	4.0	Not a *lot* more than what you saw on TV	2007-02-26	0	0	0
B000E5LEXS	Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself	A6NHF6L1J1XXE	W.D.	This DVD clearly shows why his fans adore Jeff Dunham. Every single one of his puppets has a character of their own and it's so much fun to watch Jeff argue with his 'co-stars'. Thus he proves what many of us think: it can be really refreshing to be politically incorrect and to use language that is part of everyday life but officially banned. This might be a reason for parents to keep their kids away, but it is also the reason for Dunham's success.	5.0	A feast for fans of comedy	2013-02-12	0	0	0
