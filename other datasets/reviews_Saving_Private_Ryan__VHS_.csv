B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1YLT08OZK81SF	22	Whoever said you need to rent Full Metal Jacket is right. Private Ryan was great technically, great cinematography, but the plot w/ tom hanks and matt damon was a joke! Don't get me wrong, they're great actors- but you just  can't stick them in a movie like this!  Please, just get Kubrick's Full  metal Jacket- and while you're at it, get the Stanley Kubrick Collection!  And if you want a great commentary- check out Brazil!	2.0	FULL METAL JACKET!	2000-01-02	6	4	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1166FE81ADOUR	50s sci-fi Fan	"Saving Private Ryan hit me so hard that I could not move for ten minutes after the credits rolled. James Francis Ryan had a wake up call that no 19 year old should have. At his age he should still have had time to be the know-all smart Alec kid that was his prerogative. Instead he stood on a bridge in France with Capt. John Miller telling him, ""James, earn this...earn it,"" with his dying breathe. Be worthy of my death and the deaths of my men to save your life; words that were to haunt and change the rest of his life.And I liked the way Spielberg didn't let us off the hook with the Normandy landing, there were no quick cuts and compressed action shots. We had to ride all the way into beach with Miller and his men. I found the everyday ""normality"" of the sound of the landing craft engine almost maddening as I watched so many the men ride to death. I had a bizarre reaction to the long opening scene on the beach as the men finally took out the machine guns; I knew intellectually that I was watching a movie, but in the pit of my stomach I had a queasy feeling that I was watching CNN live and I just had to sit and watch helplessly.Spielberg uses his effective form of putting ordinary men into extra-ordinary situations with this film too. Captain Miller, a high school English teacher from Pennsylvania is given a tough assignment in the Rangers, who are given the tough assignments in the army.I found the only flaw in the dialogue was when Ryan asks, ""Why me, why should I be saved?"" Miller starts on some talk about that was too dull for me. The point was that it had nothing to do with James...it was all about Sean, Peter and Daniel; his three dead brothers and the nation's refusal to ask more of one family than it humanely should - that is it would not obliterate a family by wiping out its bloodline.For me, this it the best war movie since Lewis Milestone's ""All Quiet On the Western Front."""	5.0	The best war move for seventy years	2007-05-31	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A19XY14J27WCOG	Aaron	This movie reminds viewers that war is a terribly frightning thing.  The Speilbergian touch (Upham) is enough to make me want to re-edit the movie, though.  It's loosly based on historical events, but each of the characters are so distincly written-in to the story that it watches more like PROPAGANDA than a homage to the fallen.	4.0	Refreshing	2003-09-30	4	2	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2KK0YGK535IN2	"A. Boyer ""consumer"""	Saving Private Ryan is a very well made movie, but is somewhat 'hollywoodized'. Spielburg is not one to make beauiful movies, but he puts quite a bit of depth into Saving Private Ryan. I would not call it the best war movie of all time, if you think it is please see The Thin Red Line, but it is definatly one of the the best. I won't forget to mention it is one of the more graphic war movies. I've been known to have a 'different' taste in movies but I think everyone can agree that this is a very well made movie that deserves credit.(although I'm still sour with Spielburg because of A.I.!  why did Kubrick have to die?!?!!?!!)	4.0	Great Movie, awesome acting	2002-07-09	3	1	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1IUKCH5SSWUFD	actiondude	This is not 'just anoter war movie' as some previous reviewers have called it nor is it 'just another Spielberg movie'The film opens with a WWII  vet along with his family visiting one of the U.S. D-Day cemetaries in  France.  It then moves to the invasion day itself in one of the many  landing crafts transporting a few of the many GI's that served on that day  and follows one Capt. Miller and his squad from their day on the beach  through their 'politically correct' orders of locating and extracting Pvt.  Ryan, who's mother will be notified of the deaths of three out of four sons  all on the same day.  Ryan's three older brothers, all serving in the U.S.  Army were killed in action the previous week and the Army is trying to  avoid the publicity of getting a whole family killed.The film is a  stark, graphic and brutal portrayal of landing on the beach and surviving  the next hours only to be givin the Herculean task of locating a single GI  who's unit is out of contact 'somewhere out there' in an area dominated by  the Wehrmacht and returning him safely to an Allied-controlled zone.  The  portrayal of the characters in the squad are complex and diverse.I am no  fan of Mr. Spielberg's work however this movie stands alone for several  reasons:First, being an amature WWII historian of the European theater,  I found this film to be so remarkably consistent with accounts I have read  from numerous airborne and amphibious assault GI's as well as pilots who  were involved in the June 6, 1944 D-Day invasion which is the largest  amphibious assault in military history.  The fact that many, many WWII vets  who served on D-Day who saw the movie and were moved to deep emotion is  anoter testimony to it's authenticity.Second, It is presented in such a  way that the average moviegoer can grasp some of the unbelievable,  superhuman tasks and actions that the rank and file GI's were called upon  to do and did without regard for their own lives.  I have always been eager  to talk to surviving WWII vets but now I make it a special task to shake  their hand and tell them 'thank you' for the job done so selflessly by so  many.Third it is an important work because it highlights only one of the  many, many stories of a handful of average guys thrown together doing the  impossible on D-Day and the weeks afterwards.Several other reviewers  have taken great pains to point out the film's shortcommings but I believe  that these points, most of them correct, are not the truth and only point  to the validity of the movie as a seperate entity from the screenwriters,  director, and actors. By itself, examining it as a whole, it is a character  study and human conflict all rolled into one and portrayed in vivid,  engrossing detail.Incidentily, Hanks and several others spent several  weeks in a condensed bootcamp lead by real U.S. military Drill Instructors,  living in the field, eating K-rations, and being exposed to the realities  of a GI's life.  All this brings about excellent performances from the  actors who's names are both large and small.	5.0	Not just a movie, a film.	2000-08-14	4	2	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A24G0WYP655MLV	A Customer	First, let me say that Spielberg did an outstanding job and this is an important film with great acting.  It is up there among great war films, but ones such as Das Boot, Apocalypse Now, Catch-22, and Full Metal Jacket  still stand out as the tops.  I urge you to check those out first before or  in addition to Saving Private Ryan.I would say that Saving Private  Ryan had impeccable and more realism in the D-Day and battle scenes.  Yet  in a way it detracted from the real suspense and horror of war by just  handing the viewer graphical depictions -- limbs on a silver platter, if  you will.  The other movies I mentioned show the real face of war -- it's  atrocities and absurdities.  While the plot of Saving Private Ryan dances  around those things also, I believe it gets buried in the audio and video  technological wizardry.  It becomes a case of &quot;less is more&quot; in  my opinion.	4.0	A Great Film But Not the Best War Film	2000-06-21	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1UJI61C25D89G	A Customer	This movie is not based on any documented historical event; it is a recreation of June 1944.  When it was first shown in 1998, a newspaper story said the army would have used a chaplain, not eight men.The movie starts with a landing craft under fire in Normandy. It takes fire, no one seems to shoot back.  Didn't these boats have a &quot;pulpit&quot; with a machine gun?  The simulated slaughter is gory and gruesome.  &quot;The 'glory of war' is moonshine&quot; said Sherman.Isn't Iowa mostly flat land?  Would they have a house on top of that hill?  Wouldn't some of the sons have a deferment as an agricultural worker?  Raising food is important in war or peace.  I don't believe that War Department scene where they picked out the Ryan deaths; weren't telegrams used instead of letters?After capturing the radar site one surviving German soldier is blindfolded and sent away unescorted; shouldn't he have been secured and turned over to G-2?  Would an officer have stood aside while his men argued over the prisoner's fate?There is one scene where a wall collapses (symbolism?) and both sides hold their fire, until some Rangers act.  Is this realistic?  There is another scene in the village where their translator hangs back and cringes while another soldier is knifed to death in hand-to-hand combat.  I didn't understand this message.  Later the translator captures five enemy soldiers; one says something in German, and is shot dead.  There was no subtitle, so what message did I miss?When the battle for the bridge is almost lost, tank-busting P-51s appear, like a deus ex machina, to win the battle.  A happy ending means commercial success.Its been many years since I last saw &quot;To Hell And Back&quot;. but I think it was a better story.	3.0	Viewing History Backwards?	2001-11-15	14	5	9
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2FE8EIEGNWC41	"Adam Cole ""Ministry of Silly Walks"""	I'm not going to waste time on a comprehensive essay, because SPR has already been analyzed to death on both technical and artistic grounds.  Something like the Omaha Beach landing (or the breaching of Rommel's Atlantic Wall in general) is such a monumental event, it's hard to go wrong with a realistic portrayal because it speaks for itself.  Taken as a dramatic whole, SPR embodies all that is noble and all that is annoying about Spielberg, a man who earnestly brings all the awesome powers of filmmaking to bear on historical projects of fundamental significance yet falls short when it comes to trusting his audience and transcending clich&eacute;.  Despite his undeniable talent and unquestionable sincerity, Spielberg all too often epitomizes American heavy-handedness.[SPOILERS follow...]There's one major story element that makes little sense and has always bothered me:  Consider Private Ryan.  The guy loses all three of his brothers, refuses an opportunity to go home in the face of a deadly threat, then stays behind to fight in a horribly pitched battle in which many fellow soldiers die while successfully defending a vital river crossing.  After all that, we're told, he's supposed to return home, invent a better lightbulb, and live like a saint in order to &quot;earn&quot; their sacrifice and give it meaning.  Theatrically effective, maybe, but my reaction was &quot;Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot?&quot;  Miller's company gave their lives ELECTIVELY to hold an important bridgehead which might well have been lost otherwise, so it's not as though they died in vain. And Ryan himself has just shown great dedication to duty while enduring hellish combat and great personal loss--you'd think that might suffice to settle his account!Hanks should've looked straight into the camera when he delivered that famous line, because WE are the ones who have to earn our soldiers' sacrifices whenever we send them off to die.  (That's just as applicable today, incidentally.) Combat veterans like the Pvt. Ryan depicted in this film have more than paid their dues, and they don't owe anyone a damn thing.	3.0	Earn this?	2004-06-08	49	33	16
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	This movie's famous first half hour show war in all its brutality: words cannot describe the feeling in the theater with the big screen images larger than life, floors rumbling, sound pulsing. It will probably be remembered for these brutal minutes, yet the movie is much more than that. It is a look at war itself and the people who fight in it. From Omaha Beach, Capt. Jack Miller and his squad are sent to find a soldier who has been given a ticket home because three of his brothers have died. This plot has become legendary and has been parodied and spoofed to no end. But this movie is exceptionally complex, you bond with the men of the squad, and although a bit more development would have been nice, its still a compelling movie. The problem I have is that it has been called the best WWII film. Discounting period films that didn't directly deal with war like Schindler's List, I can think of a couple of equal or better ones right off the bat. The Dirty Dozen, A Midnight Clear, Das Boot, and The Bridge on the River Kwai. This is a great movie, but the others were superior in their own ways. Dozen provided comic insight, Midnight is my favorite WWII film and shows the evolution of boys to men, it is a touching coming of age story. Das Boot is a submarine story told from the side of the Germans, they are developed as real, substantial young men who just wanted honor and glory, and you end up hoping they accomplish their mission even knowing it could be your relatives on those boats. Kwai is the Pacific Theater, but it is so good and holds up so well, I just had to include it. Alec Guinness is a stubborn proud British officer who wants to build a bridge for the Japanese as a testimony to the superiority of Britain, but doesn't see the consequences. This movie definitely ranks among the best WWII movies, but calling one the best is like saying that orange is better than black, all of these movies are trying to say different things, and all do it well. -m-	5.0	Great, but the Greatest?	2001-08-29	0	0	0

He does such a good job here. Speilberg gives what, by all accounts I've heard, is a very accurate depiction of the war. He doesn't spare us gore, he doesn't spare us emotion, and he doesn't spare us time (runs almost 3 hours). He gives us a good show. Tom Hanks gives a spectacular performance. As does Matt Damon, Vin Diesel (in a role that requires actual acting), and Barry Peppar--all early in their careers. There are also great performances by Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Ted Danson, Giovanni Ribisi, Joerg Stadler, and especially Adam Goldberg. Because of color desaturation and the cinematography, this feels more like a documentary or period piece. Great job.The dvd itself is a little weak.

His complaint was that some of the shots have a white glare which distorts the picture. I'm hope he reads this, because it is certainly not a fault! That glare is a deliberate special effect by Spielberg to make the picture look as if it is being seen by a soldier with tears in his eyes. It is not a fault! It is also on the VHS version and I saw it on the big screen itself. My advice to the author of that review is that he use his imagination a little more.I know I should talk about my opinion on the film, and I will in another review, but I thought it was important to mention this.	5.0	Response to the &quot;Movie Great...DVD Flawed&quot; review	2000-12-08	1	1	0

The American troops arrive at normandy in the beginning and are instantly met with gunfire and dozens of them are offed in a split second and those who manage to get across the beach have a HUGE obstacle getting around the german pillboxes. This is very accurate the way it is depicted, and the fighting is very realistic and there is no way of determining who will survive or die in the movie, just like a real war.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A36A9HWQ9U1IK4	"A. Jogalekar ""Curious Wavefunction"""	"I have watched 'Saving Private Ryan' about five times, and not once has it failed to bring tears to my eyes. Of course, that's me because I am intimately interested in World War 2 history, and any good story from those frontlines can make me emotional. The other reason is that Cornelius Ryan's epic novel on D-Day, 'The Longest Day' was the first artifact of war I had to contend with when I was in school. The story inspired me so much that time that I will never ever forget the 101st US Airborne Division. The interesting thing about Saving Private Ryan- one may ask, why so much ado about saving one man? Many people thought that the movie was unrealistic because the mission was unrealistic, not to mention logistically wasteful; six men putting their lives at stake for one man, just because he is the last of his brothers to be living. I superficially agree with these critics, and I am sure that there must have been hundreds, if not thousands of mothers, who lost all their sons in the war. So why all the jazz about the mission, the man, and the movie?The answer comes during a poignant scene when Captain John H Miller (Tom Hanks) explains it all. Quite simply, he says that the mission might sound ludicrous, but the fact is that he won't feel like going home to his wife if he doesn't complete it. For me, that's the reason the movie was made, to show how every mission and the most mundane of objectives fits in with the big picture. It's important to realise that without these 'mundane' objectives getting fulfilled, the big picture holds no promise at all. If the men and women who are entrusted with them don't hold them up in front of their soul, the struggle is as good as lost, in peacetime and in wartime. In my opinion, it's much more than merely following orders. We see this quality in the bravest people in history, many of whose stories won't be ever heard because they sacrificed their lives for freedom. For me, the movie is most interesting because it brings up the eternal conundrum of war (and peace): how does one man's life compare with the 'greater good' of society? But for people like John Miller, it was not a conundrum, but a simple duty, the failure to fulfil which would have made them feel unsatisfied throughout life. That the secondary school grammar teacher from rural Pennsylvania, wrenched from his simple life and thrown into the enforced throes of war, comes to terms with this conundrum, is as sobering and inspiring as anything can be.My favourite scene? Just before the last battle, Miller and Ryan (Matt Damon) are reliving some of their memories. Ryan recalls a boisterous and hilarious situation with his brothers. Miller says that his wife used to say something about the rose garden. But when Ryan asks him to tell him that story, Miller says, 'No...I think I will keep that one for myself'. It's as if he knows that he is going to die, and wants to preserve one last shrad of private memory of his wife with him.At this point, I suddenly remember one of my favourite quotes by T. S. Eliot. The quote is applicable to many of the central themes in human life, and certainly to one as soul searching as war and peace:""We shall not cease to explore,and the end of all our exploringwill be to arrive where we started,and know the place for the first time""No matter how many times we tell the story of war, it should never, ever, become a cliche."	5.0	NO SACRIFICE IN VAIN...	2004-10-18	8	7	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A21WD6EN5YMFD0	Alan Jeffries	I am no great Spielberg fan.  I never liked E.T.  I thought Jurassic Park was really dumb (although the sequel was OK).  But he has made two movies that would both probably make my top five list: Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is different from other war movies I've seen.  Other such films are not typically very personal.  This detracts from the power they are able to convey.  Spielberg, for better or for worse, always manages to portray the human element in a situation, probably better than anyone else.  The near-flawless realism of the battle sequences is not for gross-out factor but to tell the story like it is.  A lot of people died in World War Two.  Not many movies really portray that.  This movie does.But what makes Saving Private Ryan a cut above all the other war movies is its story.  It's not about how many people died in some great battle against the Nazis, it's about those who survived.  This makes it all the more powerful.Combine all this with superb acting all around and a stirring yet unobtrusive score from the undisputed master John Williams, and you have a movie worth owning.  I personally have the DVD and I can certainly reccomend it.  Be warned: this is an intensely realistic movie; not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.	5.0	The Finest War Movie Ever Made	2000-11-11	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1LBMDHBZJGJ44	Alberto Diaz	This is the best war movie ever, this is what Spielberg can do, don't settle with Jurassic Park or E.T, this is Spielberg at his best, this movie and Schindler's List are his best movies, probably the only ones I count, both show all his sides, his smartness, his sense of humour, and his point of view about the awful but strangely appealing theme about war and the holocaust. But let's cut to the chase, firstly, Tom Hanks as usual is great, the rest of the cast, probably the best movie for everyone, the are all well known but in other movies their acting abilities are either not shown or are not able to be shown, but in this movie all proof to be great, smart, serious actors, the all make you fell like you are there fighting and finding Private James Ryan. The story is pretty good, plus, the movie is pretty moving. And the best of it is it's Cinematography, never a director had put into screen a more accurate, realistic, intelligent and crude way haw the war really was, this is THE movie for looking at the war in this time, D-day. The scene of D-day, is an incredible achievement, I watched it with some friends the other day and we were all amazed like if it was the first time, plus the AMAZING sound of the DVD makes it more realistic. The special features are fairly good considering it is not a Collectors Edition, if you buy a war movie, buy this if you don't already have it. You will not be disappointed, this movie deserves more stars and more Oscars, it should have got Best Movie, what was the Academy thinking, oh well if they loved Titanic so much, it is perfectly understandable that they prefer silly and romantic films like Shakespeare in Love, which was not that good. Saving Private Ryan was 100 times better, perhaps not in customs and soundtrack since it has virtually none, or maybe it gets lost with all the bullets that are fired, but it deserved much more, well the movie does not need to be reassured of it's greatness, just watch if you are in a hurry the first 40 minutes and the last 30 minutes and you will see my point. Pearl Harbor tried to imitate the filming style for the attack, and sure it was good, but we all know the original. This is the one.	5.0	BEST WAR MOVIE EVER, CONGRATULATIONS SPIELBERG	2001-12-19	4	4	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's acclaimed 1998 film about small-unit action during the early days of the Normandy battle, is perhaps one of Hollywood's best attempts to depict the horror and yet-mesmerizing spectacle of battle.  It reawakened an interest in World War II and spurred directors to make their war movies more graphically realistic.  Even more important, it made many of us sit up and realize just how much we owe to the rapidly dwindling number of World War II veterans...the men and women Tom Brokaw rightly calls ""the greatest generation.""Based loosely on a real life incident of the war, Saving Private Ryan is the story of an 8-man squad of U.S. Army Rangers detailed to find Private James Ryan, a paratrooper whose three brothers - all soldiers serving in combat units - have lost their lives.  When Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) is told that Mrs. Ryan is going to get all three death-notification telegrams in one day, he orders that someone has to find the sole surviving Ryan boy in Normandy and ""get him the hell out of there.""The officer assigned to lead this almost impossible task is Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), who on D-Day saw action on Omaha Beach.  A veteran of many battles in the Mediterranean, Miller is chosen for his skill at undertaking tough assignments.  Relieved temporarily of his company command, Miller leads six Rangers and a company clerk/translator to find - and save Private Ryan.While far from perfect, Saving Private Ryan was a daring gamble on Spielberg's part.  He had already delved into the horrors of the Holocaust in his 1993 Oscar-winning Schindler's List, but he had never devoted an entire film to combat before.  In most of his other World War II-era films, he had shown glimpses of the war.  In Saving Private Ryan he carries audiences into the middle of battle, never flinching or looking away from the worst spectacles of war.Some reviewers, particularly from other nations which were combatants in mankind's greatest and bloodiest war, criticize Saving Private Ryan for not showing ""the full picture"" of the battle for Normandy. Had Spielberg done a remake of Zanuck's The Longest Day - to which this movie has been compared - the criticism would be valid.  The Longest Day - like the book of the same title - is a panoramic view of D-Day that encompasses all the nationalities involved, whether attackers or defenders.  Saving Private Ryan, however, is not a documentary about the entire Normandy invasion.  It is a look at the bond between soldiers in a small unit, and it shows the camaraderie and genuine affection soldiers feel for one another.  Furthermore, Steven Spielberg is an American director, so it is natural that he would tell his D-Day story from an American point of view.  Criticizing Saving Private Ryan for being focused on American soldiers is as absurd as criticizing Wolfgang Peterson for filming Das Boot from just the German point of view.  I'm sure the Soviet/Russian movies about what they call the Great Patriotic War don't show their Western Allies' point of view either.  This will be true of all the warring countries.  Each has stories to tell, and I am sure each has its own equivalent of Saving Private Ryan.The DVD from Dreamworks Home Entertainment also includes a making-of featurette, two trailers, a cast-and-crew list, and a special message from the director.  Like all DVDs of Spielberg movies, there is no director's commentary."	5.0	Spielberg Goes to War	2003-07-09	11	9	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1N1UN3KSXKPAE	"Amazon Customer ""Army Officer"""	Beautifully shot, especially the opening sequence on D-Day, but ultimately, there's one glaring flaw in this movie.  Steven Spielberg just doesn't understand the army.  If the Chief of Staff wanted to pull a private out of a line unit in another theater of operations, he wouldn't dispatch a squad of rangers to go traipsing around the French countryside to find him.  The C-of-S would contact the theater commander, who would then contact the corps commander, who would contact the division commander, the brigade commander, the battalion commander and finally, the company commander, who would send his first sergeant to find the soldier and get him out of the Area of Operations, or AO.  In fact, this is how it happened to the real private Ryan (it's documented in the book, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;).  Why does this matter?  Because the rangers spend most of the movie complaining about how the army clearly values this Private Ryan's life over theirs, and if a commander ordered them on a mission like this, they'd be right, but no commander with half a brain would do it.It's important to remember that when he was first promoting it, Spielberg tried to sell Private Ryan as an antiwar movie, and in antiwar epics, American officers do blown-brain things like wasting lives for no reason.  The reality is that most commanders won't send their men out on pointless missions, but don't try to sell that in Hollywood.	2.0	It's no Band of Brothers	2004-03-26	15	8	7

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AX6YZZ47ZWUPW	Amazon Customer	This film in my opinion, must be considered one of the great films about WW11.  Along with the Band of Brothers film, and the Pacific film.  This film shows the brutality and senselessness of war.  The pointless carnage, the incredible waste of resources.  But in my view the true heart of this film is its attention to the human factor in war.  It shows how war destroys human beings emotionally and psychologically, literally stipping them bare.  Is it really any wonder that when these man returned home , they were not the same.  The experience of combat imprints itself on a persons personality and of their emotional outlook.  The civilians could never truly understand the wartime experience, because thet never faced actual combat. They simply heard about it from those who were fortunate enough to return.  I highly recommend this film to WW11 fans, it is well worth adding to one's WW11 collection.  JRV	5.0	The Real Experience of War.	2013-08-18	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A217UEH83RHN1Z	Amazon Customer	As a serious student of World War II and having served in the military for 9 years, I have seen just about all the WWII films made.  One thing that has been missing from all the films I have seen prior to Private Ryan was a  realistic portrayal of what combat is really all about.  I agree with Mr.  Ambrose (the historian quoted in Into the Breach) that this film stands  alone in capturing what it was like visually in combat in World War II.  Far more than that, though, is the stunning emotional impact this film has  on those who really understand what the story is all about.  This isn't  just another war film, it will go down as the final definitive statement on  the US role in World War II and the impact it had on an entire generation -  on the battlefield and in the homes of those serving.  If anyone wants to  really understand the sacrifices made on our behalf today, this film must  be seen.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan	2000-02-16	3	2	1

What I will tell you is that you will walk away from this movie a changed person. That's the sign of a special movie, not just entertaining but touches you on a spiritual level. I know that sounds off the wall for a war flick but it will open your eyes to the cruelty of man! War is devastating and if you know someone who was in WW2 or Vietnam, you can see that they are different from you and me. This picture let's you be part of such a realistic experience, you start to suite up, grab your ammo and wait in a foxhole until the enemy rolls forward. There is nothing more I can say about the movie; it's just a phenomenal motion picture. For you home theater buffs, the picture is superb and the sound track will perform an audio assault on your system. Bullets will be whipping around you as they ricochet off metal barriers, buildings, tanks and helmets. Tanks and explosions will make your sub rumble, it will feel like you're in the middle of the war.

Steven Spielberg earned the Best Director Oscar for this film, and rightfully so; this is an incredible work. The production is  incredible down to the smallest details.This movie rings so true to  actual WWII combat that it is at times very hard to watch. Even the  cinematography during the opening sequences was planned to simulate combat  photography. The results are stunning. In fact, many images are far too  strong for children and some adults.This is a powerful, highly  emotionally-charged movie. What Spielberg has accomplished is to make a  film that is at once a memorial to those who fought and died to preserve  freedom and a strong anti-war statement. I was reminded over and over again  of the saying that heroes are simply ordinary men in extraordinary  circumstances.This is, quite simply, a masterpiece of film making.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2000-05-27	1	1	0

The young men (boys) that stormed the beaches of Normandy, in 1944, were committed to freedom, and willing to make a difference.  My father was a part of this Great Crusade.  He was involved in intelligence and communications.  He recounted to me that on the evening of June 4th, the men were excited to go.  They wanted to ""get the job done"" and take down Hitler's empire.  The men were EXCITED.  How many of our young people today, would be as excited to go and do a job--even with the knowledge that some would not come back?  Far fewer than in 1944.I have been so proud of the part that my father played.  Small as it may have been, it was the small contributions, made by 100's of thousands of dedicated men and women, that made the difference.Spielberg and Hanks hit a homerun with this film.  I really loved the ""action-camera,"" as if you were really there.  It brought a reality to that great day that none have been able to depict.  The story was great--men giving their all to save ONE man.  I have to say that my heart races everytime I watch the first part of the movie, and that tears fill my eyes at the end.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3ROE64EVHDTTV	"AMP ""Al"""	Blu-Ray review.  If you're reading this for another format, then some of this information may not apply.Film:  4.5/5, Picture Quality:  5/5, Audio Quality:  5/5, Extras:  4/5, Overall:  5/5Quality:This Blu-Ray is great; the picture does show some extremely fine film grain, a few white specks here and there, and some very faint scratches. Most of it is barely noticeable unless you really look for it; the image overall is extremely sharp and detailed, and darn near perfect. Chances are that the grain/noise may be in the director's intent, as is the gray and dull colors. Sound quality is awesome.There is a plentiful amount of extras, taking up a second disc in this set.My copy came with a slipcover.Film:Truly a war film for the ages. The battles are long, bloody, and intense. In between, each scene is loaded with tension and suspense. In every scene, there's immaculate detail that showcases war (and the battle of Omaha beach specifically) in the most realistic light possible. It's close to three hours long, but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences. A combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers, and it has to be seen to be experienced.The story for this is fine and dandy, and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey. It's also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war, the human spirit, and philosophy. The film takes every intellectual advantage of the story's nuances, and with a cast of quality characters, the film does have plenty of strengths.One problem I have is the plausibility of the story. No way in heck would the Army risk eight men to rescue one, regardless of the circumstance. Surely, if they did this for Ryan, why not everybody else suffering from losses? Then, who would be left to fight? Singling out one soldier just never made sense to me. Incidentally, it didn't make sense to the story's characters either, and as they discuss and find the value in the issue, the story works in its own bizarre way.Additionally, the scene in the middle of the film (where the soldiers charge after a target of opportunity) struck me as dumb and unnecessary. The main character became uncharacteristically arrogant at this point, and the scene overall felt out-of-place. I almost suspect that it could have been removed from the film completely. I'm also not fond of the film's commemorative beginning and closing; it strikes me as manipulative and overly-sentimental.Otherwise, the film is exceptionally strong. Despite some herky-jerky cameramanship, I do love the photography throughout; there are lots of intimate close-ups and interesting long-shots, they are all full of detail. Acting is really good; Tom Hanks is the man, Tom Sizemore is not bad, Edward Burns is cool, I loved Barry Pepper's role, Matt Damon is surprisingly strong, and it's interesting seeing Vin Diesel in the mix. Writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments. Production value is very strong, with highly-detailed and seemingly-realistic sets, props, costumes, locations, vehicles, weapons, and everything. Music is a little overly-sentimental at times, but good in other parts.Recommended.4.5/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 5/5)	5.0	"""Where's the sense of riskin' the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?"""	2011-06-01	3	2	1

What was the worst was the scene with the German guy getting arrested and forced to dig a ditch singing ""I say can you see"" (a mockery of our anthem); then it's very ironic that Ryan - a private - ignored the ordered from Chief of Staff General Marshall to return home, and nobody did anything to punish Ryan for disobeying a direct order, this among other mistakes makes this movie, in my opinion, the worst WW2 movie ever.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2SLA0SXRQV8M0	Andres C. Salama	I wasn't too impressed with this film when I saw it more than a decade ago. It's a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in Normandy during World War II and subsequent battles in France. The film starts in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying. I remember that another film dealing with World War II was released at around the same time, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which dealt with the war in the Pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie. Private Ryan opens with a now famous scene of the landing in Normandy that is very well done, but the film sort of goes downhill (though not catastrophically) from there on. The character of the German prisoner, for instance, is very crudely written and performed. I have to say, however, that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows American soldiers killing German soldiers as they were surrendering. This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things. And Spielberg shows this matter of factly, he doesn't give moral judgment on this. For this honesty, I praise the movie. But on balance, I think this movie is only fair.	3.0	Sentimental film about D-Day has some flaws, but is not without merits	2011-03-02	5	2	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AH138LYODR3D1	Andrew Fair	Spielberg has been workng up to this movie for his whole life.  As a fan of his, I couldn't wait for this movie to hit theaters.  It is without a doubt one of his finest and certainly stands amoung the top war films of  all time.First off, there is the poignant view from the late 20th  Century, the aging and fragile war veteran revisitng the battles of his  youth.  This film is a poem to the World War II veterans, and in that  respect, it has a humming patriotism that recalls the films made during the  war.  Yet it delves deeper than that and manages to surpass its  rather  standard story structure and comment on the greater truth of war, heroism,  life, death, and country.Clearly the most noticeable aspect of SPR is  its stunning, breathtaking brutality.  The Omaha beach scene and the  climatic final battle are both suckerpunches of directing and  cinematography, a visceral perescope view of the true violence of war.  Never before has combat been captured so realistically, so graphically, its  power enough to bring understanding to those who never have seen war, of  what it is all about.  For those who ahve witnessed bloody combat, it is  almost painful to watch.  This film is important and it is above all,  excellently made.Standout performances by Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper  and Tom Seizmore add great flavor to the story, along with a strong Hanks,  Burns, and Damon.	5.0	Poetic, Tragic, Violent	2000-06-22	7	6	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A34PN9T3BVYU9W	Andrew	I loved this movie. I've watched it millions of times and I still keep watching it. It is a war masterpiece and it was the top-grossing picture of 1998.The movie begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion. And then shows that eight men must recruit Private James Ryan from the battlefield. This movie has lots of sad scenes and the bloodiest scenes I have ever seen on film.The movie is very intense as you watch the brutal realities of war and the eight men who all search for hope and grows with honor and courage. This is a great movie but I would not let kids under 17 watch this movie.	5.0	Best War Movie Ever Made On Film	2003-05-26	5	1	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AEUBC3796HY0H	Andrew Jacobsen	Saving Private Ryan is a tremendous film. I forces the viewer to see World War II as it truely was. The battle sequences is the film are amazing; and  the use of hand held, low camera angles make you the viewer feel that you  are in the action. The begining D-day sequence was directed and filmed to  perfection by Spielberg. However, the ending battle sequence is harder to  watch because of what happens to some of the characters that we followed  through the film. The story of Private Ryan was done just as well as the  battle sequences in the film, questioning what the value of human life is.  Private Ryan really makes you see how terrible war, as it is a well  constructed anti-war movie. Hanks, Sizemore, Burns, and the rest of the  cast give great performances. Private Ryan should have won the Oscar for  best picture.	5.0	Outsanding	1999-11-01	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1KEYTS8EB0Z	Andrew McDonald	I have just recently viewed 'Saving Private Ryan' and would like to praise all involved.  This film is a must see for people of any age.  It shows the complete sacrifice and dedication of the soldiers during the D-Day invasion  and also deals with other, deeper social issues. Being someone in his  twenties, I had not realized the true nature of this war until it was  presented to me in this stunning visual format.  These men died so that we  would know freedom.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AK75SH1YPHJLH	Andrew Valadez (viper@aol.com)	Saving Private Ryan is an exelleny war movie which depicts the everday life of a soldier. Steven Speilberg did an outstanding job with this movie. Not only is it realistic but it is pretty darn accurate.  It not only shows  what the soldiers go through but their family and loved ones too. He  created some of the best battle seens I have ever seen. Like in the  beginnig when this soldier loses his arm and go's around looking for it.  When he finds it he just picks it up like it was nothing.  He did such an  exellent job with the movie that I actually felt frustrated too when the  medical personal were stopping a soldier from bleeding. They spend such a  long time on him until they finally stop the bleeding,then all of a sudden  BAAM! He gets shot in the head.  The longer you watch the movie the more  drawn in you become.  My favorite part is the &quot;Final Battle&quot; when  Tom Hanks and company make a last stand. His Squad make a small fortress to  fight the incoming Germans. Private Ryan would have never  gone home if it were not for Tom Hanks. He did not have to accept the  mission,but he did. Why you ask? Could it be he is just a good natured man?  Could be he was crazy? Or could it be he just wants to finish this mission  and go home to his wife?  In all I think this is the best World War 2 movie  of all time. Kudos to Mr. Spielberg for his exellent movie Saving Private  Ryan.	5.0	Brilliant, an instant War movie CLASSIC.	1999-10-13	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1645XR6FWWC80	Angie	I first saw Saving Private Ryan on 24th November 1998, at 7.15pm. My life  has never been the same. When I left the theatre to return home, I felt so  sad, that I cried all the way. Over the summer I saw the movie again on  numerous occasions to try and figure out why it affected me so much. Why?  Because of its brilliance! This movie managed to totaly turn my emotions  inside out. Every Character that was portrayed, particularly Miller,  Mellish, Reiben, Coparzo and Wade, touched a piece of my soul. The tragedy  in this film, was so intense that i still, now two years later, cannot  watch it without tears streaming down my face. I am a major movie buff, and  am a fan of many genres, however Saving Private Ryan has made it to number  one at my top ten list.	5.0	Brilliance	2000-09-10	5	2	3

It made those of us who were not in WWII realize how scary and  bloody it got.  Every War has its casualties, but if your not there to  witness it first hand you never know how bad it got.  This movie is as  close as you get to the truth.  Gettysburg and Saving Private Ryan are the  only movies I've ever seen that could even compare to the real thing.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2I4VTPKGSQZ75	Anthony Hand	"Like everyone else who saw the film I was very impressed with the first 20 or so minute's of 'Saving Private Ryan', apart from the silly opening with the old guy in the cemetery. It certainly did offer a view of combat that no other movie, of any period, has. It is probably the most re-watched and talked-about section of the entire film, and for good reason too. Bullets and shrapnel have never flown so realistically on a screen. Bodies have never been pulverised and destroyed so convincingly in any other film, about any other war, as far as I can remember. If one thing is to be learned by future filmmakers, it should be to emulate or attain the same realism of combat that 'Saving Private Ryan' put on the screen. There are very few heroes in war and this is reflected well in the 20 min Omaha beach section of the movie. A large number of the soldiers are cowering or dead. The few who are trying to rally their men do so mostly in vain and the slow movement across the beach to the ""Dog Green"" sector is the result.After this explosive section, everything settles down and we get to the meat of the film.Following the death of Ryan's brothers, an order goes out from U.S. headquarters to rescue and return safely, the last remaining brother, James. Unfortunately, this is put across in one of the most cliche ridden scenes that I've seen in ages. It's really typical of Spielberg's attempts to pull the audience heart strings, but they never really work and usually let his films down. Also, this basic premise of the movie is a nonsense in itself. There is no way in the world that an army would send a squad of men into enemy held territory to rescue one man, especially given the circumstances of the first few days after D-Day and doubly so because he is a private. However, once you are over that you can allow the film to take it's course.The squad of men start out into their mission and squabble and argue over the order to do so and quite rightly too, which goes some way to ease the unrealistic nature of the film's premise. The banter is very good and entertaining as the men wander, somewhat without fear of German activity through the occupied French county side! As they continue their journey they come across different situations that threaten them and their mission to save Ryan.One of the first obstacles to their mission takes place in a superb set piece, in a shattered French town, where a German sniper has Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) squad pinned down. He dispatches the squad's first casualty and it's handled marvelously... right up until Spielberg has the US sniper shoot him through the eye piece of his Gewher 43 rifle, that is. Unfortunately, It's this type of nonsense that knocks a few notches off of the overall score for 'Saving Private Ryan'. A simple shot through the head or chest would have sufficed and the squad could have moved on about their business, without the inducement of groans.Likewise, the botched attack on the MG42 outpost a little later, suffers from some incredulous activity. No officer worth his salt or with the experience that Hanks' Captain Miller is supposed to have (he's been involved in the war since Kasserine) would have ordered a frontal attack of such an obstacle, without properly thinking out or analysing the situation first. How long would it have taken to scout around behind the outpost to make sure that there wasn't a German regiment somewhere beyond it? Or picking off the German's in the MG42 nest with the sniper? Both situations would have lessened the chances of casualties and would have been more beneficial to the squads central mission, into the bargain. In the ensuing assault, however, another squad member is killed, in a scene, which is probably the most shocking of them all, including the spectacular Omaha Beach scene, as we witness a graphic and harrowing death, presented in a gritty realism that echoes in your head for days afterwards, like so much of the film, it has to be said.There are more parts that grate however and unnecessarily so too. The German soldiers never seem quite human. They are roughly the same, typical, dummkopf Nazis that Spielberg has been putting on the screen since 'Raiders of the lost Ark', which is a bit of a shame really, as the film is quite polished in many other areas. Also, Speilberg's pushing of Holocaust related messages are irritating in the extreme. I can't help thinking that the death of Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) served a thinly veiled metaphor for the Nazi extermination of Jews.Small inconsistencies in realism and how the German enemy acts, also deflates the whole project and knocks off that last star. For instance, every German soldier has a shaved head, which is more reminiscent of Russian conscripts than the Wehrmacht. One senses that this is another Spielbergian attempt to equate the German's of the 1940's with the neo-nazi skinheads of today. It's just too heavy handed to let go.The final set piece of the movie, sees the newly found Private Ryan, his comrades and Hanks' squad, team up to hold a bridge against the oncoming Germans. This noisy battle scene, which filmed with great skill, also exhibits some serious flaws. It's first and foremost, a situation that would have been far more historically correct, if the tactics were switched, with a small band of German soldiers holding the bridge against supeior U.S. forces. Such was the balance of the day. But as it stands, it's a realistic enough sequence, if you allow for the stupid German tactic of driving their armor down a narrow street right into an obvious ambush. Remember, the 101st soldiers guarding the bridge had just had their ass's kicked previous to Ryan being found by Miller's squad, so the Waffen SS soldiers tasked with securing Ramelle would have known of their presence. A few moments of shelling from the Tiger's 88's would have not gone amiss, and the tower from which the U.S. sniper was stationed (and from where he would eliminate a large portion of those silly Germans) would have been the first building shelled. Of course, we won't mention the fact that the Tiger tanks or the 2nd Waffen-SS Division troops in question, were no where the area at the time. Historically, the 2nd Waffen SS Division ""Das Reich"", were still on their way to Normandy. These flaws in the final battle sequence, while annoying, are still possible to forgive, as there is a fair share of excitement to be had. Speilberg's skill as a director of action sequences is on fine display.Lastly, the end of the movie offers the final let down. We go back to the old guy in the cemetery who we saw at the very beginning of the film, for a soppy sequence about ""being a good man"", etc. The film really could have done without this framing device as it subtracts from the movie, instead of adding to it. The movie really should start with the landing craft approaching the beach and end with captain Miller saying ""earn this"".All in all though, 'Saving Private Ryan' does have an awful lot to recommend it. Which is why I am giving it four stars. The acting for the most part is well done, with Hanks being surprisingly good as Captain Miller. I personally think he's one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood, but he does have his moments. The lights are stolen by Tom Sizemore, however, who is watchable in every scene and superb as the ever faithful Sargent Horvath.I'm probably being a little too hard on 'Saving Private Ryan', if the truth be known, which perhaps stems from my interest in the period the film would have earned five stars (not a score I give that often), if the above things (and some others) were corrected...which really isn't that much to ask from a movie that purports to be historically correct."	4.0	Another flawed Spielberg masterpiece	2001-03-15	13	11	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	I was expecting a lot from Saving Private Ryan. It was released in Australia months after the US launch and so, I had plenty of time to read the reviews, watch the trailers and hear folks talking about it on-line.  The frightening thing was, that almost everyone was raving about it; not  just high praise, but rabid enthusiasm. So I was hoping it would be  wonderful and at the same time trying not to mortgage my future enjoyment.  It's happened before; an otherwise good film is still disappointing because  the hype had led me to expect a great film.Well, I needn't have  worried. &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is a great film but that is not  why it can't be hurt by expectations. It makes a beautiful flanking  maneuver around any prediction or, for that matter, any description. I knew  the plot, the actors, most of the events and still I was not prepared for  the film's effect.After watching &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;,  a friend described it as &quot;Horrific&quot;. He was right. But it wasn't  horrific in the way, for example, the bombing of Dresden was. It was  horrific in a very personal way. Spielberg manages to breath the same air  as the men fighting in Europe. Oh bugger... I don't even know why I'm  trying to describe it. The task is beyond me. Perhaps writing a synopsis  will help to free my tongue.&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; has an  interesting story. I think I would have wanted to see it even without the  hoopla. Imagine a family of four brothers, all serving during the war but  in separate divisions and different parts of the world. Four service stars  hang in their mother's window and everything is ripe for a future of heroic  deeds and tearful homecomings. But somewhere in the thick of the D-Day  invasion, three of the four Ryans are killed. The remaining brother's  situation is not known with surety but it is certain that he has been  dropped behind enemy lines.Don't you want to know what will happen  to the last Ryan brother? Do some of you want to comfort his mother or  perhaps help the last Ryan in some way? In this case, help is sent from  above. Initiated by a nostalgic general who seems to believe that saving  Private Ryan is akin to saving his whole family; and protecting American  families is every soldier's purpose. Whether this view is shared by the men  he commands, is not considered, and by the end of the film, not at all  clear.Eight men are chosen to perform this duty. Eight very real  people. During the course of the film we get to know each of them  intimately and when death comes to some of them, it is a very personal,  shocking thing. Death and general mayhem is graphically portrayed  throughout the film. It is done so well that you are forced to believe all  other visions of war you have been shown, are vague shadows of the true  horror. But for the eight men we travel with, death is not something that  can be excused. I wanted to save each of them. I wanted to rename the film,  &quot;Saving Miller's Company&quot;.But in the end, as with  life, we don't get to rewrite the script. Captain Miller and his men don't  have many choices. They follow orders, not because they understand or agree  with them, but because it is necessary. They are not supermen with bulging  biceps, Sten guns in their hands and knives held in their teeth. They are  hero's and demons and everything in between.I am only just  managing to stop myself from writing an article about war, its stupidity  and inevitability. Save me the effort. Go and see &quot;Saving Private  Ryan&quot;. If you held off because of the violence, see it any way. It's  the closest thing I've seen to a fitting warrior's epitaph since &quot;All  Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. Honor the past by understanding it, not  glorifying it.	5.0	Patriotism meets pragmatism	2000-05-11	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A9JXNTUFYCVTP	"""apilsch"""	I must say that both times I have seen &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; I was overwhelmed by the images flung at the viewers during the opening minutes of the film.  Janusz Kaminski has set the standard in action sequence photography here (imitated in, recently, in &quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; to name a few), and the gut-wrenching, blood curdling  screams that waft out of the speakers are harrowing to say the least.  However, with that final shot of the beach, and then a fade out, the movie devolves into a sputtering, clich&eacute; ridden trip through the histrionics of war movies that have basically undercut everything the GIs in &quot;Ryan&quot; fought to preserve, a better world for their children.  Full of the same war movie clich&eacute;s that have hindered films about World War II's portrayal on film since before the war was over (watch &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; to see what I mean), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; presents the viewer with an amalgam of cardboard characters and chest-thumping patriotism that is frankly sickening.  It's really too bad that Spielberg had to get it so right on Normandy's beaches because, for the rest of the movie, he got it so wrong.  I think the most appalling thing about the existence of this film is the assertion, by so many people, that it is &quot;the best war movie ever made.&quot;  Obviously these people have never seen &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; or &quot;12 O'clock High&quot; or &quot;Midnight Clear.&quot;  If you love &quot;Ryan,&quot; watch those films, then watch &quot;Ryan&quot; again.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	"Saving Pvt. Ryan was the best picture of the year hands down. Anytime someone takes a much traveled genre like the war movie, and reinvents and reinvigorates it while raising the bar for future films it is exceptional. Spielberg did that here. No one has ever depicted combat quite so effectively, and Pvt. Ryan is now the standard. Even the negative reviewers concede the Omaha Beach opening is stunning and excellent. But, I think the assault on the machine gun and the closing! battle just as intense and vivid.Pro War? Please. I don't think Spielberg's purpose was to be pro OR anti-war. I think his purpose was to honor the sacrifice of the men who fought the war. Period. But within that context, I think the death of Wayne (the Medic) is as horrifying in its unexceptionalness as anything I've seen on screen. This is war, overdosing with morphine a friend who is bleeding to death with a shredded liver. Just like that. And Mellish's hand to hand fight and vain attempt at stopping his own killing after being overpowered...this is pro-War stuff? Not to mention, that at the end of the movie nearly everyone in the squad has been killed.The idea that Spielberg was glorifying Americans at the expense of everyone else is nonsense. This movie wasn't about Stalingrad & the Eastern Front. It wasn't about the entire operation of Overlord. It wasn't about the entire scope of the Allied effort. It was about one squad of Rangers landing on Omaha and !then getting a strange assignment. Period.That such a mission never happened? So what? That there was no plot? That IS the plot. The mission. Works for me.One quick comment about the idea of cliched characters etc. Who do these people think fought the war? It was wise guys from NY, hillbillies from W. Virginia, hispanics from S.California, southerners, hobos, college men etc. How in hell else are you supposed to show them? AND, the military of WWII was not integrated, in case you didn't know.As to the reality of the ending battle. First, when the Sgt. says ""something good coming from this mess"" I don't think he meant all of WWII. I think he meant the mess of this mission and the men they had lost now & everywhere. Second, the Germans are attacking the town, Miller & the Airborne defending. Door-to-door street fighting is the most casualty-intensive fighting possible, and the advantage is usually always with the defenders. That's why soldiers hate it. S!o they had a chance and they had a plan....ultimately to retreat & blow the bridge. If you think this is too far fetched, you should read Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers etc. and find out just how incredible small unit actions have been. Many are unbelievable.And what were Miller & his squad to do when Ryan refused to leave? Say ""tough luck 101st, we're outta here"". Maybe. But I think they would have stayed & fought. Just read about the Rangers who scaled the cliffs on D-Day. Courage was a common currency in those days.As to the acting, characters etc. I thought they were fine. There were no false heroics to my mind. I believe they wanted to honor these men and they played it straight. Hanks was believable to me portraying a school teacher who is now a leader of men and his scene where he does the awful math of the men he's lost and the rationale he uses to live with the fact says it all. He seemed to me an average man having to do impossible, horrible things and wo!ndering what it is doing to him.The movie is about suiting-up, showing-up and getting-on-with-it. It is about the everyday heroism of doing the dirty job and trying to survive.Was the movie flawless? No. I would have had Ryan tell a better story to Miller than the somewhat stupid and cruel one he told. And, for that fact I didn't get the point of Wayne's story about his mother. The German shooting Miller and Upham shooting the German was somewhat problematic (emotionally satisfying, but empty. If the lesson is mercy will get you killed, by that logic, he should have shot them all)....but these are minor quibbles in a great effort.What about Spielberg? Spielberg is a brilliant and clever director. Too clever? Sometimes. But I liked most of his touches and flourishes. I liked the sniper seeing the other sniper shooting at him. I like the wall coming down & the standoff. I liked the tank rolling up on Miller blowing up by a seeming gunshot. I didn't mind !the bit of deception at the opening & closing of the film because by the time it ended I was moved by the sentiment. I thought the opening & closing battles were magnificent. I like his compositions. I thought all the combat throughout had a genuine feel never depicted as accurately before. His camerawork & direction was continuously inventive. I thought death was shown without glamor. The courage as that mustered up and brought to bear by ordinary men. Enough.I could go on, but what's the point? If you are nitpicking this movie you have missed the experience. And it WAS an experience (especially on the big screen) that was exceptional for eye, ear and emotions. If you were not moved, so be it. I found it a beautiful tribute to the fathers and grandfathers who did what they had to do. And it came as close as anyone has been able to convey to an audience the horrors they had to endure.It isn't a documentary, and it isn't a history. It's a movie. But a first rate! movie in all departments."	5.0	It's Brilliant.	2001-06-25	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3BZJVV0M0CTPY	"""arcticsniper"""	This is just another Hollywood war film. Watching this film made me lose all respect (not that I had any to begin with) for Spielberg and Hanks. I can't believe they said Monty was overrated. He was the best allied commander of the war. Typical Yanks, taking all the credit for themselves.The only reason Monty took his time moving on Caen was because the British and Canadians had to take on the Elite of the German army, including SS Panzer divisions. The U.S. soldiers only had to fight the normal army. It's more American propaganda, making themselves look like the best when that is not the case.	2.0	It's this film, not Monty, that is overrated.	2002-05-19	8	4	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3SH2Z6PZ5XBXR	A reader	Frankly, I enjoyed this movie, if only for its special effects.  Obviously, great care was taken recreating the battle conditions during the D-day landings and probably this, in itself, is reason enough to see the movie.  As well, most other scenes whether or not they include actual fighting are impressively reconstructed with extensive attention paid to detail and Spielberg and the rest of his production crew certainly deserve kudos for a job well done.Aside from this, I found the actual storyline to have many glaring weaknesses, some of which annoyed me no end simply because credibility was too often sacrificed in favour of producing an entertaining story.  Captain Miller's shortcomings as a leader, for example, become obvious from the very beginning when he is shown, under the stress of combat, to slip into periods of virtual catatonia and especially at times when resolute leadership is most necessary.  Is this a human failing we, as viewers, should sympathize with?  I don't believe so since such a condition, which Miller neglected to report to superiors, would only serve to needlessly endanger the soldiers under his command.Speaking of soldiers under his command, Miller's leadership remained irresolute.  He sees several American infantrymen murder two Germans attempting to surrender yet does nothing.  Later, he organizes an attack on an enemy machine gun nest only to have the platoon's medic killed in the assault.  Why was a medic, a non-combatant, participating in such an action?  Shouldn't he have remained behind out of the firing line?  Neither Captain Miller, nor the writers offer any explanation.  And why was the attack organized in the first place?  When a soldier questions why the attack is even necessary, Miller answers that their mission is to win the war, or at very least, prevent the enemy emplacement from ambushing any other American troops.  What is not addressed is the fact that such an attack could very well alert other German troops in the area and jeopardize their stated and very specific mission of finding and saving Private Ryan.  And where is their radio?  Could they not have simply radioed the position of the machine gun to headquarters?  Or was radio silence to be strictly enforced?  And, if it was to be enforced, wouldn't such an attack make even less sense?  Again, the issue is not addressed.What I found even stranger was Miller's handling of an almost open revolt among his men who do not want to continue the mission.  Under actual conditions, any competent officer would have had his NCO arrest and discipline the offending parties for cowardice and dereliction of duty.  Instead, Miller makes a wimpy and almost pathetic speech about his background and his desires to get home even offering to allow one soldier to return to headquarters without punishment.  I am almost certain that, in the real world, rewarding an act of insubordination in such a way would have tempted the rest of the platoon to demand similar treatment.Finally Captain Miller virtually abandons his entire mission when, after finding Private Ryan, he elects to help Ryan and his men defend a French village's main bridge.  He takes Ryan's initial refusal to leave the town in stride.  Instead of simply ordering Private Ryan to obey his command and move out, he debates with his NCO whether or not they should even save Private Ryan at all.  What?  After coming all that way and losing two men in the process, he is asking such a question?  Unbelievable.  And remaining behind to defend the town?  Why?  Again, no explanation is offered.  Does the strategic value of the bridge supercede General Marshall's specific orders to find and secure Private Ryan?  Evidently.  A more logical approach would have been to evacuate all troops and simply blow the bridge especially when the observer in the bell tower indicates to Captain Miller the approach of a significant contingent of enemy troops and tanks.  Yet, instead, Miller, knowing he is outnumbered, elects to stay behind and engage in a senseless battle, losing virtually all his men and almost getting Private Ryan killed.  I am sure such an action would certainly have warranted a court-martial or, at the very least, a severe reprimand, had Miller survived.  All things considered, I suppose credibility had to be sacrificed in certain cases in order to tell an entertaining story but I can't help wondering if a little more thought had been put into the story line instead of the special effects, a more believable movie could have been made.	3.0	Great Special Effects but Weak Storyline	2013-01-17	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3LUZB2YONDGQC	Arkaan Semere	To say this film is just a combination of great footage is completely overlooking the greatness of this film.  The opening battle scene is a masterpiece of chaos.  Not to be viewed by the faint at heart.  It can be  compared to Picasso's Guernica for anarchy.  The closing battle is just as  moving in a clear-eyed way.However, saying 'theres not much else'  means that one wasn't watching the film.  The (admittedly) simplistic  script is balanced by the examination of cowardice and heroism.  We see  soldiers who really aren't supposed to be in a battle field.  The  performances are all uniformly incredible.  Jeremy Davies deserves special  mention for his incredible nervous breakdown scene.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A19VMQDCB4HZ9P	"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen"""	I have to say that Steven Spielberg's devastating opus concerning one of the turning point of World War II is a much more effective war film. Right from the start Spielberg throws the audience right into the meatgrinder to show that war is hell, but even through it all men rise up to do what is needed to survive and help their fellow soliders. The cinema verite documentary style Spielberg and his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski used for the entirety of the Omaha Beach landing on D-Day is one of the best shot 30 minute of film ever. Other war films have shown the brutality of battle (Platoon and Hamburger Hill are two great examples), but that 30-minute opening sequence sans a score put the audience on the beach and through the fire the Germans put down on repel the men of the Allied invasion force. Spielberg's choice to forgo using no background music and just letting the sounds of the battle affected me more than anything else ever put on film. I am what one would call a gorehound and this opening sequence made me squirm and almost turn my eyes away from the screen.The script is not as tight as that of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, but the dialogue remains strong enough to keep me interested in the fate of the men sent of to find Private Ryan. The slow parts of the film seem almost like a rest period from the sudden violence that sunddely came on the screen until the final battle for the bridge in the climax. It's almost as if Spielberg needed to give the audience a chance to catch their breath before being plunged back into hell.The final battle may not have had the grand guignol and brutality of the opening sequence, but the complexity of the scenes and how the battle could be easily followed throughout the chaos and mayhem was astounding. I just couldn't imagine how he was able to pull off some of those shots and get them perfectly. Again, his documentary style of shooting the battle lent a realistic quality to the sequence. Even now, filmmakers have imitated and tried using the same techniques to show the chaos of battle. Spielberg has set the bar high when it comes to creating a film about war and people have tried to reach it, but still have to succeed. Whether one is anti-war or not, Saving Private Ryan is one film that take no sides but also makes an argument for either one. It is also one of the best filmmaking Spielberg has done and one of the best film in the last 20 years.	5.0	The best war film out there and one of Spielberg's best...	2004-08-02	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1N8NRZ0FJ16ZJ	"""atydbwl"""	As I sat through the first 30 minutes of both movies I decided to write, not about the actual movie, however but the sound quality and differences.  You will be able to read about the movie from other reviewers, but for the record, it was an exsquisite and moving film.  I just recently got the DTS version of the movie and I have to say the sound quality is more superior in comparison from DTS and Dolby Digital.  Needless to say, both are incredible sounding, however the DTS, I feel gives more depth to the sound environment around you.  Not only that, but the LFE of the movie is more resonant in the DTS version.  The Dolby Digital version gives more of a precise, pinpoint sound in each of the speakers, however the DTS version gives more of a 360 degree feel to the sound, blending the sounds from one speaker to the other.  In the DTS you are able to hear more of the gun shots especially from distant shots.  Best example of this is comparing the portion of the movie right after the first big fight.  When Captain Miller opens his canteen to take a drink of water, and a little bit before that exact scene,  you'll be able to hear gunshots clearer in the DTS version against the DD version.  Ambiant sounds are more clear in general and enveloping in the DTS.Now, however with the improvement in sound comes the drawback of the lack of the featurette &quot;Into the Beach.&quot;  It is a big loss to the DVD, however when you sit to debate whether you want better sound or one more feature on the DVD is up to you.  Eitherway, with both the DTS and Dolby Digital version of the movie, you can't go wrong.  You just have to decide which you would prefer.  For those audiophiles, I strongly suggest DTS and whoever else has a DTS capable sound system, I strongly suggest that copy of the movie.  Otherwise, you are set with the Standard copy.	5.0	DTS vs Dolby Digital Review	2001-05-25	8	6	2

The first half-hour or so is an authentic masterpiece of recreating the D-day invasion at Omaha beach. Speilberg's use of hand-held cameras to give you a &quot;your are one of the grunts&quot; perspective and spectacular special effects is simply amazing. Interesting to note that there is no music soundtrack during this period of the movie.The other story is a fictional account of a hardened group of soldiers being sent to retrieve one private (Ryan), who has lost 3 brothers in recent fighting. Many have criticized this movie, maintaining the military would never have attempted this. But these people miss the point. Assuming this did happen, I believe this movie shows correctly how the real soldiers would have handled the situation. In fact, in telling this story, Speilberg allows us to understand how and why the characters deal with the terrible scenarios they face, as well as how the soldiers bond with one another. Ironically, at the end, you understand exactly why the military would never attempt such a rescue!The acting is outstanding and very believable. There may be some sterotypes, but people with these character backgrounds did exist and fight in the war at all levels and positions.Others have criticized the opening and ending scenes at the cemetary. Remember, it was watching a WWII vet collapse in front of a fallen comrade's grave that inspired Speilberg to do this movie in the first place - so it does deserve to be depicted, even if it is over-emphasized to some degree.Overall, this is a true masterpiece, because it's a movie that leaves a permanent impression on those who have the guts to watch it. It should have won the Best Picture award.Highly Recommended!	5.0	Haunting, Realistic WWII Portrayal; Super Directing/Acting	2001-09-03	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1E1WKSRGBQ9J5	Austin Cramer	The scenes of wartime violence are effective and realistic, but it isn't enough to make a movie great. There isn't enough to the movie besides the violence. That doesn't mean the movie is pointless, but the violence takes  up too much running time. The scene at the beginning works but the scene of  violence at the end is overlong. O.K. war is hell,we get the point. Problem  2: the characters and their journey for the most part aren't exactly  memorable. Problem 3: the characters are too modern, THIS MOVIE IS SUPPOSED  TO TAKE PLACE OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO! Problem 4: the movie offers little (if  any) insight as to what led up to the D-day invasion. Speilberg didn't  bother to set up the situation or the characters. In spite of it's  problems, it is a very good one and worth seeing, but IT ISN'T GREAT.	4.0	OVERRATED	2000-02-10	7	4	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	"This is a superb movie, one with a horrifying depiction of the terrifying action on the beaches and in the fields of Normandy during those first few fateful days in June of 1944.  It was then that by force of arms the Allies attempted to wrest back nothing less than the whole of the European continent. Stephen Spielberg hooks you into the story by using a contemporary scene of the massive burial grounds where thousands of Allied casualties are buried to introduce a main character, who then remembers, in a flashback so vividly monumental in its scope that it will certainly leave you breathless and gasping for air.Everything about this movie has classic written all over it, from Tom Hanks moving portrayal of a man who must lead his platoon deep into the battlefield in search of a single soldier in order to rescue him and bring him back to the shore for evacuation; all of his three brothers have been killed in action on D-Day, and General George Marshall has ordered that he be saved in order to prevent the family from losing all of its sons to the war. The cinematography is exceptional, and the scenes depicting the landing on Omaha Beach on D-Day are so graphic and done so masterfully that one reels in attempting to describe them. They must be experienced to be fully appreciated, and then hopefully on large screen TV system with an excellent sound system.The supporting cast is terrific, from Tom Sizemore to Edward burns to Jeremy Davies to Vin Diesel to Harrison Young, who plays the fifty-something Ryan breaking down at the grave site in the opening scene of the movie. Of course, Matt Damon turns in a wonderful performance as the young Ranger who finds himself conflicted by the set of existential circumstances him finds himself in, all of his brothers killed, and ordered to now desert is own squad under fire to save himself. But excellent performances are nothing unusual for this very gifted young actor. The entire cast supports the emotional telling of this tale.This is the second of Spielberg's movies about World War Two, the first being ""Schindler's List"".  This shows a growing sense of seriousness and a new gravity to his work, which is both popular and now more substantive. I was most impressed with the incredible care taken by the production company to faithfully recreate all of the elements of the story authentically and in context, from the green and brown packs of ""Luckies"" to the pandemic cussing and cursing that real-life soldiers used to communicate. While his does soft-soap the meaning of SNAFU, he otherwise gives the closets thing to the actual experience one might hope to vicariously witness to approximate the situation on the ground on D-Day.

Steven Spielberg proves once again that he is head and shoulders above everybody else. The first 20 minutes or so of the film is some of the rawest, most gripping, most brutal piece of film ever filmed. It's tough to watch, and definitley not for everyone. The rest of the film is the same way. The war scenes are as real as real could get. You'll feel like you were right there. The sound is the greatest sound I've experienced in watching a film. The bulletts sound as if they were whizzing right by your ear. It is phenomenal. This isn't an entertaining movie. It's not a good time. It's not something you can watch over and over. This movie is very brilliant and highly educational. It's important for everybody to see this film. Especially younger people. This is real. This is history. There are moments of this film that will haunt you for a very long time. There is only one moment in the film that sorta ruins it. It's a scene where a German passes an American on the steps after killing one of his fellow soldiers. The German, with gun in hand, just looks at the American and keeps walking. That part is Hollywood. Thankfully, it was the only part. The cast is incredibly good. Tom Hanks is phenomenal. Matt Damon is good, but he could've been given a better part. There's a rather odd cameo by Ted Danson halfway through the film. What's Sam Malone doing there?. This is a very special, important film. You need to watch this. I'm not guaranteeing that you will have a great viewing time. It's not that kind of movie. Just watch it and have the great feeling afterwards that you've seen it. You'll be a better person for it.

Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore put in their usual top level performance and the remainder of the cast is rock solid as well.  The mission given to Tom Hanks and his men is a bit unusual but adds to the sense of tragedy of the crusade in Europe.  The true gem of this movie; however, is the special effects.  The opening sequence on Omaha Beach sets the pace.  I saw this originally in the theater and when the landing craft ramp drops and the German machine guns open up, I actually ducked.  This level of realism continues throughout the movie culminating with a close combat battle between GI's and authentic German Armor.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3SW2DOKAGL5QJ	"""b-byte"""	First, I want to say that for some reason some people are confused as to what films Steven Spielberg has made. People in this column seem to believe that Spielberg has made Star Wars, Forrest Gump, and the Goonies. Well they  need to get their information right.  Saving Private Ryan has a realistic  story due to the fact that it was based on real life incidents. Some people  believe that it was over patriotic and made the Germans look ignorant. I  disagree, the Germans were more than conpetent, you can tell from the  opening scenes were the Germans slaughtered 2,500 Americans at Omaha. The  sound and the visual effects are extremely impressive and at times I felt  like I was in the middle of it all. The acting was not academy award  winning performance but it was convincing enough. This movie was cheated  out of the best picture of the year award, needless to say I feel that it  was one of the best pictures of all time, and should become a classic.	5.0	One of the best films of all time	2000-04-11	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A281387UUS2IN5	Beantown Jim	Another towering achievement for Steven Spielberg, this is a must-have for any cinema buff or history-minded person.The story revolves around several brothers who are lost in WW2 (patterned after the real-life Sullivans, brothers all, who were lost on one USNavy ship); the War Department was determined that the one remaining brother should be spared by being pulled from the field.The DDay invasion was presented flawlessly, with barrage balloons, landing craft, the iron crosses sunk by the Germans to deter landings, etc.  When the landing ramp goes down, you feel as if you were there at that moment on June 6, 1944.Regardless, the action on the beach before the German defenses were overrun was intense and thrilling.  The film consisted of the riveting opening, the absolutely thrilling conclusion, with a lull in the middle.  The squad that will 'save Private Ryan' land on DDay and are later informed that they are being detached to march thru the French countryside (Normandy) to find Private Ryan.  There are some missteps(where they find the wrong Private Ryan), some encounters with the Germans, and finally the breathtaking battle at the end, where a bridge is being held by the US forces, including Private Ryan.War has seldom been presented in such a nuanced and absorbing way.  My beloved father had served in the medical corps in London, tending to the DDay men after they were med-evac'd, and he was speechless after seeing the film.  It had brought back memories and shown him things he'd only heard from those under his care...I can think of no greater tribute...	5.0	Another towering achievement for Steven Spielberg, this is a ...	2014-07-04	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2VIQ61HJSCWX4	BeatlesFan3287	My grandfather was a private during World War II, and though he fought in the Pacific, he was driven to tears when he saw this film during the last years of his life.  This is a film that touches people on so many levels; and by people, I don't just mean WWII vets, though they surely will be the most effected, but I mean anybody who respects those who fought to preserve America and the rest of the world for generations to come.  As this films shows, it came at a catastrophic price for all those involved.The premise for the film is that three out of four brothers fighting in the war are killed, and the forth, James Ryan, has a ticket home.  An effort is then arranged to rescue him out of Nazi occupied France.  To risk an entire company of soldiers for one man does not flow well with many including Captain Miller, played masterfully by Tom Hanks.  At times the uselessness of the mission seems to go hand in hand with pointlessness of the war.  Both sides relentlessly fight and kill each other as normally innocent recruits become unrecognizable as killing machines.  Indeed, the incredibly violent battle scenes illustrate this as men are blown to bits, faced with machine gun fire, and put through the absolute horrors of the campaign.It's not all blood and guts though.  We get to learn about most of the characters throughout film.  A timid Corporal who has rarely fired a gun is driven to near madness.  Even he eventually finds himself killing in cold blood near the end as everything collapses around him.  Then there's the church scene, an oasis in a desert of destruction, where we are treated to some incredible dialog by the soldiers.  Hank's Captain Miller in particular is a very well rounded character who must not only face adversity from the enemy but also from his own men who constantly label the mission as FUBAR (****** up beyond all recognition).Steven Spielberg's direction is nearly flawless.  The use of filters to make the battle scenes dim and dreary is especially effective as is the somber score when it pops up from time to time.  The sad, bleak tone is offset by a metaphorical light.  The soldiers hope everything will be better and they can get back to their lives at home---if only they can make it through the war alive.War is not a beautiful thing.  So naturally this film is not beautiful in the sense that there are colorful flowers and blue skies everywhere.  War is not about that.  War is horrific.  The pointlessness of the violence, which is a product of war, is the madness.  There is nothing mad, however, about wanting to fight for your freedom and the freedom of others.  I think that's what this film was all about.	5.0	A Film That Perfectly Illustrates The Horrors Of War.	2013-09-19	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3QSP55Z0D4QY	B. Edwards	I am going to be wholly honest in my review. Saving Private Ryan is not a perfect film, nor is the story anything more than a vehicle to take a band of soldiers from one necessary encounter to another.  The story is mediocre, and I have no problem crediting other reviewers who pointed this out.What the film does with extraodinary precision and accuracy, is re-create situations that no one reading this review will ever want to be in.  The sheer madness, brutality and terrifying experience of landing at Normandy is brought to life in thirty minutes of film that I consider to be unparalleled.  Throughout the entire landing scene, all I could think was that people my age actually did this - the scene is not fiction.  The effective use of hand-held cameras and the stripping of the color lenses only enhance the landing sequence, and make you feel like you're there.The middle of the film can be slow at times, but the script drops in a sniper, gun post, and other brief sequences to keep the movie moving as the plot and characters are fleshed out. The film moves towards a dramatic showdown over a bridge.  The final sequences are as exciting, yet frightening as anything you'll ever see.The film does a remarkable job of illustrating that many of the soldiers who fought this war were just kids, from different backgrounds and all fighting a war while recognizing the utter madness that surrounded them.  Spielberg deserves mountains of credit for portraying the violence in a non-Hollywood manner.  The violence is excessive and at times hard to stomach, but the honesty and realness of the war scenes greatly enhance the impact of the film.  Spileberg shows us what war is really like, and not a glamorized version that is so often presented to us. And the violence is not used to entertain (unlike in Gladiator, which deplores the violence of the Collaseum within the film but then glorifies it to entertain the moviegoer).The cast is well-rounded, with Tom Hanks giving a highly-effective performance as a Captain who is tired of wathcing the kids he's trained die in front of him.  Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribesi, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies round out a diverse and talented cast.Even if parts of the film bore you, Saving Private Ryan is a film that everyone should see, all the time telling themselves that young men actually lived this.  For lack of a better phrase, they saved the world, as did soldiers from the myriad of other countires that fought against the Axis Powers.  While some people criticize the film for making it appear that Americans were the only people fighting in WWII, I believe that the concept of the film was to show the effects of war on a small band of soldiers.  There were too many indivuduals who fought bravely in WWII to recognize in one film.Finally, people can use this film to appreciate the tremendous sacrifice that those before us made. Although I knew some basics about WWII, I never fully realized the odds and implications of the landing at Normandy.  My grandfather landed at Normandy and stormed the beach. He survived that day, and the entire war.  But he did not survive long enough to meet me, as he passed on four months before my birth in 1977.  I will never get to meet my grandfather, but will always know that he was a brave man.	5.0	ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOVIES EVER MADE	2001-06-29	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3FJOLLI7RSRNQ	"beikokunotora ""beikokunotora"""	This is a well put together film.  Over-all the plot is pretty simple and some liberties have been taken with history (as with  virtually all movies &quot;based on...&quot;) but this film makes you appreciate what it must have felt like to be involved in the Normandy invasion.  The graphics were wonderful with no aliasing artifacts and the colors authentic.  The sound track and DTS implementation were also well-done, further enhancing the realism.  A very minor technical gripe on the sound was that in some scene transitions the sound disappeared when  the soundtrack faded.  This occurred twice but probably most people won't notice this.  Technically flawless otherwise.Spielberg won accolades for filtering scenes to give a documentary look...while this was interesting on the beach scenes, it seems he had two cameras and the effect was different...it was very distracting because he obviously cut back and forth between cameras (one with the effect and one without - at first I thought it was a problem with my DVD player since this was the first DVD I bought!).  In the end I think the effect was good, but should have been applied uniformily in the beach scenes.  If you look for it you will see what I mean - the effect is like haze on the lens and when sunlight hits the lens there is a sort of diffraction bands on bright parts of the image...again, it added realism but the inconsistancy of the effect from cut to cut was disturbing.  One last technical gripe is that the TIGER tanks shown seemed not to be full scale and looked a bit cheesy.  All these are minor gripes of a perfectionist though.All in all, I strongly recommend this DVD - if you are a war movie buff it is a modern slice of a WWII experience...perhaps what Oliver Stone's &quot;Platoon&quot; was to Vietnam movies - unlike many WWII movies that glorify the allies and war, this paints a somewhat more balanced picture - albeit with some liscence on aspects of history - but the movie as a portrayal of the type of combat seen in western Europe is a good one - with the starting and ending battle sequences really hitting home.	5.0	Private Ryan	2001-07-26	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	"I had to watch Saving Private Ryan a second time -years later- to fully understand the importance of World War II, and specifically, what the soldiers had to go through.  The first 30 minutes of film were truly something unbelievable.  The emotions I felt watching the soldiers landing on shore and being surrounded by enemies who didn't hesitate to attack was overwhelming.  I seriously wanted to cry.  It really touched me on a personal level that I've never felt in a war movie before.  It made me realize what was going on.  40 years before I was born *this* kind of extreme violence was happening on Earth.  It was enough to make me sick.  Human beings killing each other left and right.  I've never seen a war movie really show the extreme nature of war quite like this film.I'm totally serious- the movie begins on a really intense level, and continues for the next 30 minutes without letting up on all sorts of gun shootings, explosions, bodies falling apart and drifting away, hopeless feelings lingering in the air.  I can't imagine what it must be like to serve in war, and honestly, this movie really opened my eyes and showed me how important it is to support our troops and what they must be going through on a daily basis.  The film may be only 2 and a half hours long, but the war lingered on for years, and I can only imagine it eventually reached a point when people were beginning to wonder ""Is this war ever going to end?""Saving Private Ryan will surprise and shock you on many occasions.  Sometimes the film seems so real it's almost like you're there with the soldiers.  I recommend buying the movie."	5.0	Truly a movie that will stick with you	2007-07-17	4	2	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ABTPOCG5X5ZY0	Ben Drew	The first time I watched this film, it blew me away. It is an awesomely powerfull and moving film which keeps up the intensity for the whole 3 hours. I can't fault the acting in any way. It was absolutly flawless. Tom  Hanks, as usual was supurb, he did a remarkable job of fitting the  character of a hardened war captain.The effects also were stunning. Its  this which sets the film in a different league to all the other war films.  Especially the beach landing scene, how they managed that still amazes  me.Thoughout the film there is good character development as the team  start to bond in the face of grave danger. The theme about where the  captain came from is a nice touch. Also, I liked the individual quirks of  each character, you could use these to identify with them. For example, at  the beginning, on the boat. Capt. Miller's hand was shaking and the sniper  kissed his cross. These, idiosincrasises are used later on.All the way  through the film you are made aware that this isn't just a film about war.  It is about deeper things. For example at the bridge, the translater is  literally the weak link in the chain which makes them fall apart.It is  an epic film which fully deserves all the oscars that it got. My ONLY  slight critism is that it is possible a little too Americain.	5.0	A moving film about the true horrors of war	2000-05-21	5	3	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A34PAZQ73SL163	"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!"""	First off, I think this is a great movie.  Tom Hanks is awesome and so is Tom Sizemore.  The production shots are memorable and even, at one point, include a beach scene viewed through blood on the camera lens.  The first 20 minutes are absolutely hypnotizing.  However, I take exception with the portrayal of Americans shooting those Germans who wished to surrender.  This undoubtedly occurred but it was a very rare circumstance.  Here it happened three times within a company of 200 men.Guy Sager, in his &quot;Forgotten Soldier,&quot; documented that Wermacht soldiers like himself intentionally sought out Americans for the purposes of surrender.  To suggest otherwise is fallacious.  Also, Edward Burns character seems more suited to the post-sixties &quot;question authority&quot; environment than to WW II.  America was different at that time.  This was the Greatest Generation.  Not the &quot;me&quot; generation.  Burns is misplaced.  I also thought the cowardice of Ryan at the end was contrived.  He was an experienced soldier by June of 1944 and was unlikely to behave as he did, but, even with my misgivings, I'd be a fool not to recommend this film.	4.0	Fine Film but Very PC.	2004-06-26	2	1	1

Not only with the enemy but with his compatriots who badger him at times. A teacher at home, but only a menial soldier on the battlefield where all are equals with the exception of officers, of course.The mother's lonely farmplace looked desolate in beautiful countryside, perhaps Indiana. She collapses at the mere sight of the official car with the star on its door.The worst thing for me was the soldier who died calling for his mother. We may bring them into this world to be sent off God-knows-where to defend this country. As a mother of three sons, it hurts me to see our young American males transported to foreign lands to die in such an inglorious manner. If we are to defend America, why can't we do it at home and stop this indiscriminate slaughter so far from home and mother. By watching this movie, we learn how to die with grace.John Williams' music was splendid as always.

How could anyone obey an order to  be chopped into meat? The effects were both sickening and wonderful.I  found the story heartwarming and depressing. The bits that stuck in my mind  was the struggling drowning soldier at the start, the way that the Tom  Hanks character revealed his pre-war job, the way that Jewish soldier died  and the question the old man asked his wife at the end of the film.I  guess that this would be a good way to get people to understand the dignity  that war removes and the honour that struggle provides.	5.0	One of the saddest films I have seen	1999-12-31	2	1	1

These scenes are some of  the most powerful war scenes ever filmed.Afterwards, the movie devolves into nothing more than another episode of Combat (the TV series). The plot is supposedly based on an actual incident, but it is hardly believable as shown in this movie. Despite all their attention to detail, I found this part of the movie to be just too hokey and unbelievable.  For example, these supposedly elite Rangers stroll through  open unsecured areas, bunched up and loudly carrying on pointless conversation. Such tactics work only in Hollywood and are not what combat veteran Rangers would have done.  Such antics continue through the rest of the movie as the Rangers and others soldiers perform one suicidal or stupid act after another. It's no wonder all but one of the stars don't make it.Overall, I believe Speilberg wasted the fantastic opening sequence. This had potential to be the ultimate movie on the US in WWII. In the end it was an unfulfilling and unsatisfying movie.	3.0	Just Another Episode of Combat	2002-08-28	8	4	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A565PMDP4YNU4	Big Joe '83	"Since Schindler's List, Spielberg has really been scraping the bottom of the barrel for decent stories. His friend Kubrick was nice enough to give him the idea to A.I., Minority Report's premise of underground psychics telling the future was embarrasing and Catch Me If You Can + The Terminal are lame attempts to put a Capra spin on otherwise true stories that don't work as films. Then there's Saving Private Ryan where Spielberg's lust for war is shown at full force with an incredibly lame story.You know you can just say ""Um... its based on a true story."" Well that's not good enough. Here's what Hitchcock has to say on the subject matter of adaptating real stories into film in his famous interview with Truffaut;""To put a situation into a film simply because you yourself can vouch for its authenticity, either because you've experienced it or because you've heard of it, simply isn't good enough. You may feel sure of yourself because you can always say 'This is true, I've seen it.' You can argue as much as you like, but the public or critics will not accept it.""The problem is Saving Private Ryan takes a ""stranger than fiction"" story which is set up as comedic and places it smack bang in the middle of a serious overblown war epic. Speilberg made his cash but the film shows the evidence of a poorly constructed script. Pearl Harbor at least had the deceny to show that it wasn't intended as a realistic epic while this film promises alot but has nothing else to offer outside of the violence and that turns WWII into a joke."	2.0	The film has nothing to offer outside of the violence.	2005-02-04	31	12	19
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A32K5SPJ7UY0UR	bigman	"Saving Private RyanSaving Private Ryan is an epic World War II film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is truly one of the most moving and realistic modern day portrayals of World War II. Even though this is a movie, it holds very true to actual events, being based on the lives of eight U.S. soldiers attempting to find Private Ryan and tell him that his continued service in the U.S. army is excused due to the fact that all three of his brothers had died in combat.The opening scene is filmed during the World War II Memorial Day in France. Private Ryan is portrayed as an old man standing at the sea of graves where men from World War II were buried. From this tranquil point, there is a dramatic transition into the most moving and graphic war-time scene ever filmed.""Saving Private Ryan"" is best known for its enactment of one of the bloodiest war-time scenes ever witnessed. This scene is the landing of the Americans in Normandy and the invasion of France, otherwise known as D Day. It shows the American soldiers being hacked to pieces by German machine guns. Even though the Americans sustained heavy causalities, they still managed to take the beach head. The enormity of this accomplishment is clearly emphasized for viewers throughout this tensely visual scene.The movie has more than one scene that is truly engraved in one's mind. For instance, the part where the mother of Private Ryan is told that all three of her sons were killed is equally memorable. As the mother falls to the ground in despair, words are not used, nor needed. It is truly amazing that Spielberg was able to convey his message to the audience, without actually using dialogue, which makes the movie all the more powerful.To take the movie out into a larger context, one sees the truly vicious nature of war that Steven Spielberg was trying to portray. Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories; tales of heroic glory, such as ""Bridge over the River Quay"" and ""Battle of the Bulge"", and biopics such as ""Patten."" It seems that ""Saving Private Ryan"" falls into neither of these categories. It is a story of human courage and sacrifice. This is what the movie glorifies, rather than war itself. Even though the movie is based on a true story, some of the characters in the movie are fictional. Yet, it is very hard to accept any of these characters as not real.This film truly leaves a lasting impression on viewers. What one leaves the movie with is highly subjective. For myself, I left the movie in awe. Nothing I have seen has come close to it. More importantly, the film accurately portrayed what war is really like, without trying to glorify it, which in turn made it ever more powerful. One cannot help but have an enormous amount of respect for those who so bravely gave their lives in this war. Clearly, to volunteer your life for your country is the ultimate sacrifice and a pure act of bravery, but to volunteer your life to save another is an act of selfless caring for another human being and without a doubt that is the ultimate sacrifice."	5.0	Ryan: WOW what a movie	2006-05-31	3	3	0

The Sound was also fantastic. It has good special features as well. The only thing I hated was the case it came in. Why they started making cases with the recycle logo is beyond me. I hate that more than anything! But I still gave 5 stars because the Blu was fantastic.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan : Sapphire Series	2011-06-04	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2POYXTGSPSW7O	Bill Hensler	"This movie was so intense that a co-worker in my office nearly had shell shock after watching it on a big screen.  He was struck by three parts in the movie.  The first part was the bloody fighting at the D-Day landing.  The fighting around the bridge had two horrific parts:  the soldier who was killed with the sticky bomb and the soldiers killed by the 20mm German auto-cannon.I had never seen a director catch the feel of small unit actions before Saving Private Ryan (SPR).  Prior to that you never really felt a movie from a pure soldiers point of view.  The special effects at Omaha beach only lack sand being thrown in your face, salt water, and some unlucky soul next to you screaming with a gun shot wound.  That was worth four stars.I highly encourage people to watch this movie.  They will know the trials the greatest generation had to endure to keep Hitler from ruling the world.Conversely, there is a modern ""town hall"" meeting where the men were moving in a combat formation and talking.  Most soldiers of that period never would have openly told their commanding captain they didn't support a mission.  In real life two things would happen.  The unit would quickly found another soldier to support the mission and the offender would have been in a stockade.  The Army didn't screw around back in those days.This DVD is more intense than any horror movie.  I highly advise parents to not let children of less than 12 years old to view it.  This movie will give them nightmares.4 Stars.  It's excellent."	4.0	This is a great WWII movie	2006-02-28	5	4	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ	"Bill Lively ""Bill"""	Its hard not to cry, or just be totally stunned by the impact that this film leaves on you. The best war film since the days of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg both bring their trademark goods to the table, and wow, this film just delivers.Taking place at the Arlington National Cemetary, an aging veteran named Ryan is with his family, when the memories start come back to him. After not long we're taken to Normandy on D-Day, in a powerful, graphic 20 minute sequence showing the true horrors of war. This film, like Schindler's List before it, shows a realistic depiction of WW11 that leavs its mark on you even long before the closing credits have rolled down the screen to the tune of the National Anthem. Speilberg does an excellent job throughout the film reminding us that the people we are watching are not just actors, for they are portraying real, nameless people. People who really fought for us, amking this seem almost like a war documentary. We are reminded that all veterans are heroes no matter for what war they are fighting in. Hanks, in another unforgettable performance as Platoon captain, is leading his men to the center of the war to retrieve one man, Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon. The story itself may seem a bit strange, seeing that there were thousands of troops in Europe in 1944, so why all this just for one man? Well, watch and found out. Whether you enjoy this or not, take this as a reminder of what our soldiers go through, and that war really is hell.	5.0	Powerful....	2005-04-06	4	3	1

I've watched this movie over and over and still want to watch it again. There's so much action throughout the movie and it has a beginning that starts out  quickly right into the D-Day invasion! There's not a day that goes on  without a thought of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. I absolutely  recommend watching this &quot;pic&quot;.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AF1HT77XD8W82	"""billster"""	The first twenty-five minutes of this film are the hardest to watch of any film I've seen.  It is stark, horrible, bloody and frightening.  The realism is amazing.  I can't imagine anyone ever approaching realism this  closly again without being compared to Spielberg.The rest of the movie  has its horrors, but it's also a story of faith, redemption, sacrifice, and  the American attitude toward war.  This is probably the most interesting  thing about it.  Americans by and large dislike war.  When we are forced  into it the attitude is &quot;let's win this as quickly as  possible.&quot;No other film I have seen is this powerful and  frightening.  No other single movie event I can think of could cause so  many vets to start talking about their experiences.  Many thanks to Mr.  Spielberg for giving my father and his contemporaries a reason to talk  about this war. They were silent too long.Since there is no way a film  can honestly reflect history this is quite an accomplishment. This is  &quot;history&quot; as we need to know it.	5.0	War on the screen; as close as possible to the real thing.	1999-12-21	9	7	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2I3MJ6W2HZHH5	billybob	Technically, this is a very good film. Everyone knows about the stunning spectacle that is the initial half an hour. For this piece of action i would be tempted to award full marks. However, the rest of the film soon kicks in. There are so many worthy subjects upon which to base a film about war-the effects on an individual, a better handled pearl harbor-esqe love affair etc ect- so why come up with the ridiculous premise of sending a company of troops in search of one individual just so nice, ol' mama Ryan feels okay. A noble gesture, but theyre fighting a war for Petes sake.My second concern, as a foreigner is twofold. Firstly i am slightly concerned about the nature of the US public and the Hollywood propaganda machine. Spielberg and his ill trained cronies are modern day Goebbels. Does every historical film require a resplendencent picture of the stars and stripes accompanied by some form of emotive music, in order to win the popularity of the audience. Call me a cynic, but these films do nothing more than instruct the viewer that because there is a glorious flag waving in the breeze, not liking this film is an unpatriotic act. Maybe this is all very comforting for the American pshyce, but this very worrying and concerning for the rest of us.This brings me onto my second grievance of films such as SPR. Does the Hollywood machine go out of its way to offend foreigners. Here for example no acknowledgement of any other allied country except a derivative remark about Montgomery. Ditto Pearl Harbor. Even worse with U571. Blatant racist and unjustified depiction of Brits in Braveheart, The Patriot and here of the Germans. Take the evel skin head who is released and comes back to haunt Hanks. All this at a time when surely America needs all the allies it can get. I tell you I am a very worried bunny at the moment.Oh sorry.... the film is okay.	3.0	Another whinging Brit	2002-12-20	15	4	11

Saving Private Ryan is an all time war classic in which you probably have seen a copy of in most DVD libraries. Spielberg had good pace in this war film and makes you forget about the numbness in you ... as you sit still in amazement of the war scenes and the brutality he tries to capture that engulfed all personalities that fought in the war.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2P5HJ0X6Q1V1Q	black_thunder01@hotmail.com/ Starla Bailey	The movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; was on of the best war movies that I have ever seen.  This movie takes you to the heart of the moment where soilders came face-to-face with what they had been traing for.  Steven Speilberg instead of making a movie where it gave you the idea the  soilders never suffered, it showed you the pain that they went through.  It  showed that they wanted anything from their mothers to a cigarette.  The  actors in this movie did a wonderful job making it as realistic as  possible.  The deaths of Caparzo(Vin Diesel), Medic Wade(Giovanni Ribisi),  Jackson(Barry Pepper), Mellish(Adam Goldberg), Horvath(Tom Sizemore) and  Miller(Tom Hanks) was terribly tear jerking.  These men gave their lives  for some stranger.  I might only be 18 but after seeing that movie I don't  take life for granted anymore.  I say the movie &quot;Saving Private  Ryan&quot; is the best and anyone who disagrees please don't try and ruin  it for the rest of us.	5.0	The Best	1999-09-14	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1P7O2PAA8H1DD	Blade329	This is easily one of the BEST war movies ever.  The opening D-Day landing sequence was absolutely amazing.  Speilberg really takes the kid gloves off and with a frightening realistic look at the Omaha beach landing.  To give you an idea how realistic it is, I read that many veterans who saw this movie began having flashbacks.  This movie gives some good insight into the ordinary soldier and what they faced.  I'm not a real Hanks fan, but he was excellent in this movie.  The casting was great and believable.  One thing I did appreciate about this movie is that it kept in line with history.  It portrayed the battles and soldiers pretty accurately.  At least from what I have read.  Now, if you want the opposite of all this, see The Thin Red Line.  That movie will give you no historical value whatsoever.  For example:  The Japanese soldiers in WWII were fanatical, fearless, and brutal fighters.  Yet in this movie they are shown as cowering sheep that surrender immediately to the charging Americans.  One has to wonder how many shots of Tequilla Mr. Malik had drank before making his movie.	5.0	Fantastic War Movie	2001-04-09	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A21GBJU9M8NV5X	"BleT ""blt"""	This movie brings the reality of war right into one's living room. My  initial reaction was how can we as humans resort to such savagery. The  reality is that war seems to be a necessary evil where freedom is  threatened. One asks if there couldn't be a better way - I don't know if  there is an answer to this question.The last few lines of the film were  deep - it calls us to ask of ourselves the same question - are/have our  lives been worthy of the sacrifice made on our behalf - by men and woman  who have gone before and fought for freedom and then by the sacrifice of  Jesus trading His sinless life for our sinful one.We will need to give  an account for our lives one day. Please spend your life building something  that will last, that you may have an offering that has lasting (eternal)  value.All in all a good movie - the violence is quite graphic but I  guess this is how it was and therefore is not gratuitous.	4.0	A challenge to us	2000-09-05	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2Z28WKY1LHBKY	"blockhed ""blockhed"""	"Stinks. Sadistic, racist, mendacious, crude, nationalistic propaganda. Oh, yes, I too was fooled to start with. But you can't fool all of the people all the time. Seeing this garbage the first time, I was knocked out. But it wasn't long before feelings of unease set in. 18 months later I've come to believe this is one of the vilest and most cynical films ever produced to con the dumb masses. Nobody ever went bust underestimating the brains or taste of the suckers. Goebbels would be proud. The story is idiotic. Brain-dead.  It gains specious credibility from being presented in an apparently historical framework. The history is selectively distorted, misrepresented beyond belief. The beginning and ending are fabulously realistic. Oh yeah? Think twice, and you realise that the beginning is founded on comic film shorts from the 50s and 60s, Bugs Bunny, Road Runner, etc, where cartoon characters have their heads blown off (and grow new ones), run around carrying their arms and legs, take off their tin hats and get a poke between the eyes. Roars of laughter from the 10 year olds. The ending is based on arcade space invader games: endless numbers of faceless monsters come at you from all sides and get zapped: Pow! Pow! Pow! Wow! Zowie! Kerplatt!Racism is when  there is no differentiation between individuals. A man is viciously hated simply because of the way he looks, or the language he speaks, or the way he dresses. This film is nationalistic racism at its purest. Like they used to say in the Old West: ""The only good Injun is a dead Injun.""  Soldiers in war know it's either kill or be killed. But they also know that their enemy is another soldier, haplessly doing his duty, like themselves. For this they respect him, unless they are pathological sadists, brutalized beyond repair.  This disgusting film does a deep disservice to America. Ten per cent of the reviewers here have woken up to this sad fact."	1.0	Tom & Jerry	2004-06-06	48	15	33

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2CWAQLZHSOJD1	"BN ""beautiful_night"""	There's no doubt in my mind, that anyone who has seen such films as &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; and &quot;Kelly's Heroes&quot;, have been lead to think, that World War II was  an exciting and funny adventure. For example: When Lee Marvin leads his  'dirty dozen' into enemy land, it makes you think of Robin Hood and his  merry men. And it's a well-known fact, that when you're watching earlier  war films, you're often supposed to clap your hands or even laugh, when a  hand grenade or machine gun kills a bad German soldier or officer. But is  war really just a lot of fun and excitement? I don't think so!The first  20 minutes of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; gives you an idea about, what  war is really about. It's hard to describe, what makes the opening battle  scene in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; totally different from the battle  scenes in all other war films. Perhaps it's the hand-held cameraes, which  gives everything a documentary look, or the close-ups of kaptajn John  Miller, played by Tom Hanks. He's filmed in slow motion, and looks around  like he's thinking &quot;What are we all doing here? Why are we doing this  do each other?&quot;  Or perhaps this battle scene is different, because  nothing here is funny or exciting! And how COULD it be funny? Slaughtering,  mutilation, blood, dead, or in short: The loss of human life. Or perhaps  it's all these things put together.Young Private Ryan has lost all of  his brothers in the war. Kaptajn John Miller and his men are sent out to  get him home, because some officers in the American army think, it would be  too big a tragedy, if Mrs. Ryan lost her last son, too. That's the plot of  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. But underneath this simple story, you'll  find another story, a story about what a war does to people.&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is not a pleasant experience, but a  necessary one. I've never really liked war films, because most of them have  romanticized and glorified war. This one shows us the horror of war and  bloodshed, and does it without any raised fingers. It's that really  possible? Yes, it is, if your name is Steven Spielberg. I don't want to see  more war films after &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, because now I've  seen the ultimate anti-war film.	5.0	The ultimate (anti-)war film	2000-06-27	2	1	1

I didn't appreciate how good it really is the first time I saw it. Now it's one of my favorites. Watched on 70th anniversary of D-day to remind myself of the high cost of freedom borne by these men.P.S. if you like this movie be sure to watch HBO's Band of Brothers, also a Tom Hanks project with Steven Spielberg.

The plot, however unrealistic it may  be, suits the 8 characters well. Saving Private Ryan, in short,  is the  most realistic war film ever made.

I mean, come on, did Spielberg even  crack a history book for that final scene?  Let's take a little  look:i.)  The 2nd SS &quot;Das Reich&quot; Division did not enter  Normandy until June 10th (the movie's climax takes place on the 7th).ii.)  &quot;Das Reich&quot; had no Tiger tanks, only Panthers and Panzer  IV's.  To the best of my knowledge, they didn't use Marder SPG's  either.iii.)  The SS don't use any light machine guns.  In reality, each  infantry squad had 2-3 MG-34's or MG-42's.  The whole German infantry  stratagy was based around the machine gun.iv.)  Do you actually think  the SS would just walk blindly into a town without checking for booby  traps, enemy numbers etc, etc.  Infantry goes in first (very cautiously),  then armor.

There has been countless movies made about WW2, each with there pros and cons. In my opinion alot of war movies you see are watered down and made to have a sort of gung ho feel to it(""The Longest Day""), rather than trying to create a realistic portrayal of the events. The problem with doing that is that it takes most of the realism, emotion and grittiness out of the film(""The Great Raid""). You will find none of that here.Steven Speilberg has created probably the most realistic war movie to date, however gritty, however horrifying it may be it is for a purpose. He told the story the way it deserved to be told. I know my fair share about the Normandy invasions and I can honestly say this is EXTREMELY accurate. The movie showed war how it really is, confusing, ugly, scary, and shows us how much courage one could have when needed. Thank you Speilberg for making it accurate and not watered down.This is easily my favorite war movie, I must have watched it already about 30 times easy, and I never get tired of it. The cast does an excellent job of portraying there characters. Especially Tom Hanks and Sizemore, perfect for this movie.

It gets right to the point from the time the flag is fluttering in the breeze right up to the ending salute by the older Ryan. First 30 minutes of film are some of the most horrific battle  scenes ever filmed.The Longest Day was able to convey the immense size and  scope of Operation Overlord in various sequences, but Pvt. Ryan captures  the realism, the blood, the anguish, the stress of combat, the decay, the  horror of it all.  I, of course, like so many others got teary-eyed in  several scenes. I am glad that Spielberg made this picture. The young  people of today won't watch films such as The Longest Day or A Bridge Too  Far because they were made before their time. It is high time a filmmaker  brought the horrors of World War II to the modern cinema so the young can  get somewhat on an idea of the sacrifice the men and women of that  generation made so that this generation could enjoy their basic  freedoms.Film is not a glamorization of war, but a recreation of the  reality of battle.	5.0	A Masterpiece of Cinema	2000-06-25	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A4BNZ1OSBO77S	Brent Wigen	The combat footage in this movie is what truly makes it stand out. War is bloody, chaotic business, and Speilberg got that point across in the merciless opening scene, and the following combat scenes. It's not the retelling of the D-day landings, just a movie about a group of men who happened to be there. It's a shocking beginning to the movie, and really the part that sticks with you once it is over.I was disappointed with the way the Germans were portrayed, simply a bunch of faceless automatons dressed in grey who either killed and died quietly or cried for mercy when surrounded. They might have been Nazis, and not very nice people, but they were also human; the fighting Germans were given all the depth of the stormtroopers in Star Wars. I would have expected more. The attempt to make an emotional, philosophical movie really dies here, when you realize that in this film, the Americans were the only people who suffered, and that the Germans were simply killing machines.There are certainly some mistakes made in the filmmaking--no soldier in his right mind would walk along the top of a hill, backlit by the sun--but the depiction of what was going on in Normandy in the days after the landings is pretty true to the accounts of what actually went on, especially the confusion and disorganization of the airborne troops.While most of the characters are pretty generic (there's even a guy from Brooklyn, for crying out loud), Tom Hanks's character really stands out. Hanks has a knack for playing everyman, and does so once again here with terrific skill.While the plot wasn't the greatest and the characters are not really too deep (Uppum, along with Hanks's and Giovanni Ribisi's characters excepted), the combat footage in this movie is without peer, and that reason alone makes it one of the great war movies ever made.	5.0	Combat sets this movie apart.	2003-04-17	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A38691E5QJY8NY	Brett S	Firstly i'd like to say that anyone who is going to buy this should get the DTS version if your serious about your sound.  I have watched both versions and DTS is so much better.I consider this movie to be one of  the all time greatest movies made.  It shows the realities of this  horrifying war and the spirit amongst the soldiers who fought for our  freedom.  The fact that 8 men went in to save just 1 makes you realise just  how great these human beings really were and that people lost weren't just  another dead body.  The opening scene on the beach is enough to make anyone  feel quite weird. It's a strange feeling but one that definately bought a  tear to my eye.  The sound has a lot to do with this and you're often  caught out looking behind yourself cos it really is that real and scary.  The sounds of the guns firing and bombs going off is exactly how i imagined  it would really sound.This film is a fantastic tribute to all those who  fought in the war and is a movie that will definately not be forgotten by  those who see it.	5.0	Frightening!	2000-07-11	7	6	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1NDRG17BA095X	Brian C. Savage	Spielberg did a fantastic job of portraying WWII. He and his team did an outstanding job of getting the feel with out actually being there. Every soldier, Marine, etc. and especially the veterans of D-Day agree.  Despite  little inaccuracies, such a the characters talking while moving through  enemy territory,  which were purposely put in for character developement, I  fould the film gripping. It made me shake in the theater.  Mr.  Spielberg's crew got the slang down pat. For example in the film the Army  Air Corps is referred to as the Air Force.  Ask any veteran of that time  period and he'll confirm it, they called the Army Air Corps the Air Force.  The planes had very authentic paint jobs, even the Germans spoke German.  I especially liked the way Capt. Miller was portrayed by Tom Hanks, just a  citizen soldier doing his job so that he could just go home, while making  sure that others could too.  I wish all commanders were like him.  Honest,  faithful and just doing his job, by obtaining the objective at hand and not  looking to be promoted. The other actors were great as well.  I also  noticed that the &quot;extras&quot; did a wonderfull job too!.  When I  first saw this film there was not a dry eye in the theater, especially the  veterans were moved to tears.  I give great adoration to Steven Spielberg  and his Dreamworks team for making such a wonderful film.	5.0	THE BEST WAR MOVIE EVER MADE!	2000-04-11	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2DMMR073AZHY3	Brian C Weaver	A few have criticized the movie for showing only the Americans fighting the Germans, but lets keep in mind that this film follows an American fighting unit. The scope of the story being told is too limited to show  everyone nationality that fought the Germans. Remember that this is just  one story of WW2, not an epic depiction of the war. Also, I enjoyed this  movie much more than the Thin Red Line, which felt like a Vietnam movie set  in the WW2 era. I mean, was EVERY soldier in the Pacific theater as sullen  and cynical as the characters in TRL? Most wars this century have been  pointless and stupid, but this was was different. As a nation we fought not  to gain territory and expand our empire, but to save the world from the  darkness of dictatorship. We may have had our faults (Japanese internment  camps for one), but Hitler's regime was evil of a scale that I doubt we  will ever see again. I know it sounds jingoistic, but there is no other way  to describe the German government of the time. I see Vietnam and Korea as  stupid, bloody wastes of American lives, and the moral issues of the Gulf  war trouble me, but I am proud of what our nation did in World War II and  proud of the verterans who fought in it and gave their lives for a better  (though still imperfect) world.	5.0	A few responses to the nitpcikers...	2000-03-24	6	5	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	Well, I've put off watching 'Saving Private Ryan' for quite a long time. I'm not exactly certain why, I guess I simply burned out on the genre (the same can be said concerning mafia/gangster films). Now after finally relenting and giving this WWII war film a viewing all I can say is it's fantastic!  It succeeds on every level, unique and well conceived storyline, sharp, insightful dialogue, impressive production values, outstanding ensemble cast and of course a magnificent soundtrack by the legendary John Williams.There's definitely an unending string of accolades you could bestow upon this film and all would be undeniably deserved, this is most certainly one of the great war films of all-time. Watching these American soldiers deal with the crisis and chaos that is part and parcel of everyday life on the front-lines is both exhilarating and heart wrenching as the audience slowly comes to realize that acts of bravery and heroism are nothing more than the innate desire of mans will to survive made manifest. Spielberg goes one step further in his analysis of the human condition as he posits the ultimate question to those who where blessed with the gift of life; what did I do to deserve this and what can I do to show myself worthy of a second chance? The answer; live a good life, be a good man.	5.0	"""Am I A Good Man?"" ~ Lessons In War, Lessons In Life"	2009-11-16	1	1	0

There are few stories and better yet films that better capture the horrors of war like this.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A4G93BXKHWIS6	Brian Kinsey	Being my favorite movie, I decided to read what others thought of this film.  Not surprisingly, I found a few negative comments.  These were the writings that I focused on.  After reading only about 100 of the 747 reviews of this film I felt it was time to respond.This film is not for everyone.  It is violent, graphic, horrific, gut-wrenching, and, yes, patriotic.  Some find this type of patriotism distasteful, and I respect that as a decision that they have made.  However, I find that this film generates a feeling of respect for what ordinary men did in times of great tragedy.  Storming a beach, facing machine guns and mines was not an easy thing to do.  Yes, the 20 minute beach scene was short compared to the actual event, and, yes, it was not that easy in reality, but for movie-making (keeping the film under 24 hours long) it got its point across.  In the movie's shortened sequence the confusion, panic, courage, and pain shined through in breif, but, meaningful segments.I also do not believe that the Germans were portrayed as evil.  After killing Melish, one Wermarcht soldier spares Upham's life.  Would someone purely evil do such a thing?  Of course the released German soldier is going back to fight with his countrymen.  It was a time of war.  Tragic and surprising things happened. I do not simply believe that the whole of the German Army is cast in a negative light by the actions of a few (for a truly riviting portrayl of German soldiers in WWII see Stalingrad).  American soldiers were capable of horrors, too, as seen after the American's took the beach-head and executed unarmed German soldiers.  These characters could have been German, Russian, Italian, Japanese, Canadian, Australian or British.  I venture to believe that the reactions would be the same, but Speilberg did not make a movie about them.  This movie is about American soldiers.I did not see the American soldiers in the same light as others.  There were no John Wayne's here.  Capt. Miller is clearly shaken by his experiences in the war and, as detailed in his monologue following the storming of the machine gun-nest, he hopes that his wife will recognize him when he returns home.  I saw everyday men in unusual circumstances.  I saw men attempting to make rational decisions in irrational times.I do not question the history of this movie.  Like all war movies, including The Thin Red Line and Platoon, there are liberties taken and truths changed.  It's not a history lesson that I take away from this movie.  It is a profound respect for men who made decisions and faced situations that I hope to never see in my lifetime.  For that I honor this film.	5.0	Mixed impressions of a great epic	2001-01-03	10	7	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AOJ0ORN9VTPGE	BrKaT818	"Simply because it evokes so much emotion.  And not just at the brutal horror of storming Omaha Beach at Normandy.  Recall the scene where Private Ryan's mother collapses on the porch anticipating the news of the approaching military vehicle.  Without any dialogue that visual scene is absolutely heart wrenching.  People wept in the theaters when I saw it (twice) and it still brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it again.  For me, it was the range of emotions from horror to heartfelt to incredible valor that made this Spielberg film such a classic.I know that this film has been criticized by some for (amongst other things) its lack of objective perspective, questionable realism, being non-factual, etc.  But I wouldn't confuse ""Saving Private Ryan"" with a WWII documentary (I get that from the History Channel).  For a purely memorable movie-going and DVD-watching experience, ""Saving Private Ryan"" scores a definitive 5-stars.Great ensemble cast of Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1GB1Q193DNFGR	Bruce Lee Pullen	There have been quite a few complaints about this film, and I find all of these comments to be quite petty and not without proper understanding before typing. This film is a magnificent testement to the sacrifices all  our figthing men in WWII made in order to ensure the freedom we have taken  for granted today. Is the film sentimental? Sure, patriotism can be quite  sentimental at times, but in the case of this film it only adds to the  emotion of this piece. Is the film excessive? No, not by all the reviews  and comments made by historians and real-life WWII soldiers saying to the  contrary. In fact, Spielberg has created one of the very few war pictures  that does not glorify the violence. The unflinching matter-of-factness of  Saving Private Ryan is a very drastic contrast from say Sands of Iwo Jima  or the Green Berets. Instead it reveals war's dirtier subtlities.  Underneath all those shrapnel explosions, Spielberg and Hanks compose real  human beings under extroadinary challenges.  The film's been criticized  for being boring within the first and last half-hours. This interlude  people we call storytelling and plot-building. The tension stays reliably  intense as our small group of troubled soldiers embark hesitantly towards  their possible destinies. Sure, Matt Damon's behavior later in the film may  be predictable. Yet, human behavior is in itself predictable. The notorious  german character with no helmet has been described as mistake; many  detractors feel letting this character be individual and easily recognized  to be too convenient. The german soldier just like Orson Welles's Rosebud  or John Ford's Monument Valley are archetpal symbols of the directors  visions. They are symbolic of the film's purpose, and are not meant to be  artistic re-treat. Each character within the film has his or her own  symbolic meaning. In Saving Private Ryan we see plenty fanatastic  characterizations from every in ths cast. The film like many other  Spielberg movies captures many aspects of old films in the same genre.  Despite the lack of violence romanticism, Spielberg has fairly familar  emsamble journey story with lots of fairly obvious personal growth  relevations sprinkled throughout. Unlike most flmmakers, it is the ciematic  storytelling of Spielberg that makes all the differece. In his best  material, he always brings startling and suprising elequence to the most  typical seeming story. One look at  the unbelievable dramaitic impact of  the film's opening Omaha Beach sequence just goes to show that when it  comes to WWII material movies  Spielberg still has it.	5.0	Another Masterpiece from the Spielberg Factory	2000-01-31	6	5	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1K3JF3PBLLOWI	bulenty60@e-kolay.net	The film starts with the most difficult part of the most important plan of the Allies, the Normandy Landing. The success of the amphibious landing depens on the air support as well. The sound of the terrible waves and the cannon-fires in the background, the conflict of fear and courage experienced by the soldiers in the boat are the signs of the hell waiting for them.With the first orders given by the commander and the lowering of the hatch of the boat, the merciless fight starts. Unbelievable effects and death scenes in slow motion create a perfect picture of a war. At first sight Germans who fire their guns from an upper level seem to have the advantage but we observe the strength of the Allied forces and their strong belief in glory. The Allied forces manage to pass through the German front. The next thing is to get in contact with the troops landed by air. At this very moment it'S understood that Private Ryan is the last son of a family whose three sons have been killed in other fronts. Private Ryan has to be saved. Captain John Miller must take his men behind the enemy lines to find Private Ryan. They're risking their own lives for him. In that emotional state other soldiers react strongly but the order was definite and signed by the President of the United States. Despite the several questions in thier minds they have to go and find him. They don't realize that they could have in this position. Here at this point we understand the importance of the continuation of a family for the American society.After several attempts Private Ryan is found in a squad defending a bridge of strategic importance. He refuses to go back even after he learns the sad news. His aim is to fulfill his duty in the U.S. Army which he thinks is an horror. This is a very good example of mutual respect between the country and citizen. This is one of the very important reasons which makes the United States so powerful.Even though there were several losses in his squad he was safe at the end. He thinks anybody in his situation would have to go back, too.This film emphasizes the importance of individuals for the whole country. The feelings of loyalty and responsibility are the most important factors in a country's progress. Spielberg and his crew have given a very important message to people by making this movie.	5.0	Very effective social and war movie	2001-08-05	8	4	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A31B7TZU23GYR5	"Camelot ""Camelot0905"""	"Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man.The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: ""It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.""Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two.If you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie."	5.0	A Spectacular Movie	2006-07-21	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3ID6QHTM6VY0L	Carter Moore	The movie Saving Private Ryan tells the story of an American army unit in the climactic part of WWII that is sent on a mission to find a soldier who has lost al of his brothers, and is to be sent home.  The problem though,  is that the soldier has been miss-dropped behind the German front-line in  the middle of the German counterattack.  Tom Hanks (Captain John H.  Miller), who takes lead role, leads his squad of soldiers who go from the  hellish landing on D-Day into the heart of the war to find Matt Damon  (Private Ryan).  Along the way, the squad experiences the many emotions  that come with war.  Fear, &quot;excitement,&quot; self-doubt, sadness, and  a period of mutiny when the soldiers begin to question the mission's  objective, and the treatment of a prisoner that killed one of the squad  members.  Eventually, the squad finds Private Ryan, but they learn very  quickly that finding Ryan, and getting him home are two, very different  things.  Making an accurate movie that reflects the true nature of war, the  oldest of human customs, is no easy task.  The opening scene, landing at  Omaha Beach, shows what horrific conditions men, some under 18, had to face  to preserve freedom.  Historically, Omaha Beach had the highest casualty  rate of the entire Normandy invasion.  Steven Spielberg portrayed this very  realistically.  Some complained about the level of gore in the movie, but  would it make any sense for the Germans and Allies to fight with cap guns?  (I may not support the argument against the level of gore in the movie, but  I do advise that young children NOT see this movie).  In any case, Saving  Private Ryan has become a classic war movie, among the ranks of Platoon,  Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket.  A tribute to those (Axis and  Allied) who died on the field of battle in the Second World War, Saving  Private Ryan is a movie that should be recognized as one of the greatest,  most compelling films of our time.	5.0	Compelling	2000-02-09	10	7	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A38RWZNLU2NWRP	cary fritz	In the awful Schindler's List fashion, Spielberg creates drama the only way he knows how: killing people.  Lots of them.  Spielberg jampacked this movie with so much patriotism it makes you want to puke.  You can feel the  vomitous nationalism testing your throat.  The movie is filled to the brim  with so much Hallmark Hall of Fame-ish sentimentality it's hard to watch.  Spielberg's new style is a bunch of cut and paste work.  Ripping off much  greater directors, particularly Kubrick and Lean (both have made much  better anti-war movies), and processing it into a package that the  mainstream will lap up.  I will say that the blood, guts, and shells did  make me seem like I was there (for better or worse).  That's about all  there is that's good about this movie.  The screenwriter deserves a slap in  the head.  I really don't want him to work in that town again.  It'd be  nice if Spielberg would stop trying to win the Oscars (which are, like this  film, pretty worthless and extremely overrated) and get back to making good  movies like Jaws and Raiders.	2.0	The battle scenes were alright, I guess	2000-04-04	36	8	28

Yes some were poor, and the ending left something to be desired and did not live up to the rest of the film, but so many scenes, such as in the house where the one soldier whispered to another, was chilling.The cast did an outstanding job and Tom Hanks turned in a wonderful, low key performance. Other than the one resolution at the end, on rewatching the movie some of the minor things I thought about that were problematic when I first viewed the film were not something I noticed.If for nothing else, the opening half hour along of this movie is more than most can ever attain.	5.0	The Opening Scene Alone Makes It Worth It	2009-01-03	3	3	0

The first fifteen minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" were simply astonishing in their realism and in their historical flavor. I was not only riveted to my seat when I saw the beach-landing scene, but I was riveted for the rest of the night and the next morning. It was all I could think about.The opening beach landing scene only contained two errors that I could think of. First, none of the officers would have worn metal rank insignia on their helmets or uniforms. That would make them easy targets for snipers. Second, it was a little too optimistic (albeit necessary for the plot) to have all of Tom Hanks' principle troops survive the landing and to have them do so in complete possession of their weapons. After reading Stephen Ambrose's D-Day book, I think a more likely scenario would have been to have at least three of the characters we know and love die immediately, and to have the rest arrive on the beach, wet, shocked, dumb founded and without weapons. Most likely they would have taken shelter by the sea wall and waited all day long until a break through company relieved them. But I understand that this is, after all, a movie and Spielberg could only take realism so far. One thing he did that I absolutely loved was to imitate the film quality of Frank Capra's original D-Day photos.The rest of the film, unfortunately, was your standard, action-packed war story. In fact, much of it was ripped off from other war films. For example:1. The sniper scene: ""Full Metal Jacket"".2. The defense of the bridge: ""A Bridge Too Far"".3. The death of Captain Miller: ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"".I also thought the generation distribution in the beginning and end of the movie was a bit unrealistic. James Ryan is a WWII vet, which would put him in his seventies or eighties, yet his children all appeared to be the children of baby boomers. Maybe he remarried or got a little wild in the sixties. But wouldn't that contradict the dying Captain Miller's syrupy exhortation to be a good man and earn his survival?I still enjoyed the film and commend Spielburg for its ground breaking opening salvo."	3.0	Five stars for the first fifteen minutes	2000-05-18	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A34JGR3LMV1I64	ceffalo	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is historical because it depicts the average WWII soldiers' sense of loss and regret.  There are really two themes to this film.  First, a small band of American soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) from his combat position as part of a public relations and humanitarian cause of the high command due to the fact that Ryan has lost all three of his brothers to combat death within a week of one another.  Second, the real theme of this film is the depiction of WWII type combat action.  Both themes run together quite well and what we end up with is the best war movie ever made.The combat in this film is grisly and terrible.  A few of the scenes are so anti-Nazi, though, that there is little consideration for the average German soldier, who may or may not have been die hard Nazis.  They are depicted as die hards so that Spielberg can set up his own storyline, which he pulls off very well.This film also broke new ground in the depiction of combat and there are so many films that have copied it since that it is clear that ""Saving Private Ryan"" set a special effects standard for Hollywood on a level that ""Star Wars"" did back in the 70s and early 80s.Even if you hate war films I recommend that you watch this movie at least once.  It is a kind of a historical document and it will allow you to better appreciate the burden of the WWII soldier who gave so much to win freedom for the world in a time of dark tyranny.In my opinion, this movie is easily one of the top ten to fifteen movies ever made."	5.0	An historical mark for the ages.	2008-01-14	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2S02XWWNNHUIX	C. E. Miles	"There have been many, many movies made over the years depicting the events of WWII, but I have to say that none have captured the true feeling of war like ""Saving Private Ryan"".  This film brings the war to the screen through  the eyes of a handful of soldiers picked to carry out a most unique  mission: Bring back the lone remaining member of the Ryan family. The often  told story of the four brothers drafted at sent off to war is widely known,  but this is a very touching and artful depiction of the men who reluctantly  set off to recover Private Ryan and return him to his grieving mother. Tom  Hanks plays Captain Miller, the squad leader taking his men through the  European countryside in search of the missing private. Hanks will never be  able to play a character the lager than life, macho way that John Wayne  did, but he brings a certain every-man believability to his character. He  is not a hero, he's just a man trying to do his job so that he can get home  to see his wife. The men in the squad are an eclectic group of soldiers,  played by an exquisite cast, that often times hate each other but are  willing to die for one another just the same. The militray type preparation  that all of the actors went through to make this film really pays off  because as you're watching you believe that these men are actual soldiers  fighting for survival. The much publicized, and often talked about opening  scene depicting the storming of the beach is intense and sometimes  difficult to watch. The violence and blood are plentiful, but it is  essential to the telling of the story and setting the tone for the film. If  you have not seen this film it is definitely worth the time to sit down and  watch. If you don't own it, then you should think about adding this  wonderfully told story to your collection."	5.0	This film is a must see	2000-06-21	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1ASCECH3KOZ3P	C. Gardner	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is probably the best World War 2 movie ever made. The cast is excellent, and the cinematography unparalleled. The use of the hand-held, filtered camera during the battle scenes brings Capa's D-Day photographs to life. The story is simple--eight men are sent to find another soldier behind enemy lines--yet powerful by that very virtue. It is full of brilliant cinematic moments, such as the segueway after the horrific opening D-Day sequence: The screen goes blank for a second, and we hear the layered sounds of typewriters clicking like machine guns as Army typists write next of kin letters...Raindrops falling, then falling faster and dissolving into the sound of gunfire...Throughout the film, we are shown many aspects of combat: the depersonalization which occurs in battle (Hanks' Captain Miller staring paralyzed at the carnage around him on the Normandy beach for a moment, then stoically replacing his blood-filled helmet); the tragedy of a single death (Giovanni Ribisi's Wade calling for his mother as he dies--the most realistic and moving depiction of death in cinema, to me...); heroism and cowardice. The music is great, the characters vividly drawn, the historical details perfect.Steven Spielberg made this film as a tribute to his father, who served as a radio operator in the Pacific theater. His first film, made when he was thirteen, was a war story (in which he was allowed to use real airplanes at a nearby airbase for some of the shots). He'd been thinking of making a big film like this for a long time, and it is rewarding to watch."	5.0	A terrifically powerful film	2003-01-29	2	2	0

(past tense, they've mostly passed on) They didn't think they were all that great; they just grew up during a devastating depression, (it was all they knew) then had to deal with fascism trying to run democracy out of business. Just another one of the hard knocks of life, let's deal with it, beat those sons of b*tches, and get back home. Maybe life will be better for our kids. (Little did they know how much better) But, in the meantime, we still have to beat those sons of b*tches. This film captures the gritty, grim resignation, yet the hope for the future that a boomer (or younger) can only imagine. Spielberg is a very good storyteller, and this film is one of his best. If Hanks hadn't won too many Oscars already, he should have won for this one.

It's message is so clear that any junior/senior high school youngster will understand: we owe so much to those who've gone before, whether they fought ashore at Omaha Beach, or on the fields at Gettysburg, or...While the film is a sweeping historical (patriotic) epic, it includes many subplots dealing with the meaning of war, sacrifice, honor, courage, fear, death, family, etc.  The film's producers and writers effectively develop the personalities of the small band of GI's sent to find Ryan, so that by the film's climax we're on the edge of our chairs, concerned about who among the group will survive and just what their fate means to us viewing Steven Speilberg's film some fifty-five years later.While both &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; are truly great (war) films, &quot;Ryan&quot; seems more coherent, with characters fully developed, their personalities sharply delinated.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2UN1VPERRJX5S	"""chimpa"""	Saving Private Ryan from acclaimed director Steven Spielberg manages to portray the horror of war without ever making you want to turn the film off.  It's excellence must surely lie in the battle scenes with the initial  D-Day landings recreated with stunning accuracy.  the film however can't  keep up this pace and atmosphereand slips into war film cliches soon after.  The hero who has seen it all, the outcast, sharpshooter, wise-cracker  e.t.c are all present and correct.  Still with these problems you keep  watching as Captain Miller (Hanks) struggles with the war and mission they  were assigned... to Save Private Ryan.  As your interest is almost gone it  explodes in stunning style.  An attack on a machine post leaves another  member of the squad dead sparks a mutiny which is handled superbly by all  of the actors.  The following battle will leave you shell-shocked with the  ominous approach of Nazi tanks and troops starting an all most hour long  battle.With some technical errors, uncharacteristic for Spielberg, means  Saving Private Ryan isn't the classic film that was promised.  However it  is still a must due to the unrivalled battle scenes.	3.0	War, what is it good for?	2000-01-07	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	APQSGHG62L9RO	Chris L Lawson	My father-in-law is a WWII veteran and was overseas for 2-1/2 years. I had always known that he had seen a lot of action but never heard him talk very much about it. He was in the D-day invasion and the Battle of the Bulge,  plus many-many other battles. My father-in-law went to see this movie and  cried through-out most of it (especially the first 30 minutes). We later  talked about it and fifty years of thoughts came forth. The initial battle  sequence in the film is exactly what it was like, the sounds, the smells,  your hearing, etc. He said it was like being back on the beach all over  again. He told me, unless you've been in battle, it's very hard to describe  what it feels like. This movie hits the mark. See this movie and then thank  a WWII vet for the contributions they made to the USA.I've read alot of  the other reviews, and many people should do some reading about the  invasion before they criticize it. Many keep asking where are the British,  well, they were over on the Gold and Sword beaches, while the Candaians  were on Juno beach. The US 4th Infantry div. attacked at Utah beach and the  US 29th Infantry div and US 1st Infantry division attacked Omaha beach.  This movie was about the landing at Omaha beach. Therefore, the reason you  don't see any Brits in the film is because they weren't supposed to be  there. They fought on the Gold and Juno beaches.	5.0	This &quot;IS&quot; World War II	1999-11-28	31	27	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AR3RAD2DPXBRN	Christopher Farrell	Saving Private Ryan contains what is unquestionably the finest 30 minutes  of a war film ever made. From the landing up through taking most of the  beach, Spielberg does a staggering job of presenting the American end of  operation Overloard. This is not for the faint of heart, but nontheless  this is somthing I reccomend to everyone (and watching it on home video is  going to be a lot less daunting than on the big screen).Sadly, though,  the movie falls apart in the second half. The stunning authenticity of the  landing degenerates into war movie cliches and Norman Rockwell-style  imagry. We've got the offhand dismissal of the British and Commonwealth  contribution, even though they did most of the bleeding in the first weeks  to take the heat of the Americans. We've got the by-now absolutely standard  American ethically-diverse squad, each with his own identifiable  personality trait. The final battle at the bridge has all the failings he  so meticulously eliminated in the beach landing scene: the shockingly  incompetant Germans (particularly the tank drivers), the heroic GIs  (except, of course, for the one guy who has already been stereotyped as  paniky), a perfectly-timed appearance by the cavalry, and a heroic and  prolonged death scene for our hero. Ugh. You know, though, perhaps it  wouldn't be so bad if the contrast *within the same film* wasn't so  sharp.It seems that Spielberg is just intellectually incapable of  avoiding melodrama. This would have been a much more compelling story if  Spielberg had simply tried to tell a real story (as he did for the first 30  minutes) rather than making one up, but there you go I guess.Still, does  the first 30 minutes make up for the last 90? Absolutely. The first 30  minutes is in my opinion absolute cinematic genius, a staggering  accomplishment. But the split personality of this film is somewhat bizzare,  and I wouldn't feel bad for skipping out as soon as Tom Hanks meets that  paniky interpreter-guy. As good as Saving Private Ryan is (and it's pretty  good), I can only hope this paves the way for a truly great World War II  movie.	4.0	Half of a nearly-perfect movie	2000-09-06	18	13	5

It's so moving and  so filled with action that you find both exciting and horrifying at the  same time that it's hard to describe.You come away from Saving Private  Ryan speechless. Grateful for a generation of men who were willing to lay  down their lives to do what's right by serving their country in the war  against Hitler. The story is fictional, but the sentiments and personae of  the soldiers are, from all accounts I've read, fairly accurate. The scene  in which the troops assault Omaha Beach, one of the bloodiest meat grinders  of D-Day, is perhaps the most gripping thing I've ever seen in a major  motion picture.Spielberg uses a mock war-journalist perspective for  many of the combat scenes which gives the movie a sort of modern newsreel  feeling. I'm not quite sure it's necessary given all the realistic and very  destructive special effects, but it has the desired effect.I own the DTS  DVD version of the film and I can say that they did a very fine job on it.  Running the film in stereo gives you much the same sensations that you get  out of seeing it at the movies.I can't recommend this movie highly  enough.

I walked out of the movie forever changed and emotionally drained.  Never before has a movie evoked such emotions.  A  powerful masterpiece, Steven Spielberg's &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;  deserved the Best Picture Oscar that went to &quot;Shakespeare in  Love.&quot;  Everyone should see this film if not for its sheer power, for  its message which permeates throughout the entire film effortlessly and  subtly.  I am of the opinion that those who do not like the film have  missed that point and have no compassion for a war that left the world  defeated and dehumanized.  I really don't think the global community has  recovered from the peril caused by the Nazis, Americans, British and  Japanese.  And hopefully, &quot;Saving Private Ryan's&quot; message will be  picked out, passed around and taught so that we, as the human race, can  avoid another military conflict as large a scale of that which created  large generational gaps in families of all different religions, race and  ancestry.	5.0	The best movie ever made.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3CA89803TF5R4	Claudia Adams	"Wow.  All 5 Oscars for this film were well-deserved, in my humble opinion.  The realism is astounding.Personally, I was quite tempted to rate this film 4 stars because, as much as I hate to admit it, there were parts that bothered me, and I can't just let them fly without mentioning them:  The implausible ironies (I won't spoil them for you); the casting of the incredibly irresistable, cool, and likeable Matt Damon in the role of the soughtafter Private Ryan who instantly earns the respect of several men who had openly hated him for weeks (and that awful story he tells about the last day he spent with his brothers - I didn't exactly get a charge out of it), and even the casting of Tom Hanks in the lead role (but only because I love the guy so much for his rare gift of making people laugh just at the sight of his face and the sound of his voice; he is just too darned funny for me to take seriously on a mission like the D-Day invasion; this is particularly evident in the scene of the mistaken identity.  Who needs Bob Hope when you have Tom Hanks?)HOWEVER, I give it 5 stars not only because of its groundbreaking depiction of the reality of the horrors of war (and I don't mind the blood and guts if it is what really happened and what haunts the survivors), but because of its emotional impact.  In the bonus material, there is a mention of Spielberg's desire to depict the emotions that must have been felt through the eyes of the actors, while briefly showing one look in each soldier's eyes.  At that moment, I thought ""Bingo.""  THAT is what gives this film its ""staying power"" - the mark of all good films.  This happens again at various points in the film.  In one scene, the map-drawing corporal who found himself in the middle of this mission says that he doesn't smoke but is there nervously smoking a cigarette.  I too have never smoked, and at 43, while watching this film, I honestly wished I had a cigarette at that moment, too.  Another scene that grabbed me was them fishing through airborne division dog tags while the living airborne division walks by.  The scene where the medic relates not knowing why he pretended to be asleep as a child when his mother came home early to talk to him, which he had always wanted.  Every scene with a not-so-black-and-white life and death risk-based decision to be made on the spot certainly qualifies.  Finally, I am a mother of two young children who still cry for me from time to time; hearing a young man cry for his mother just about sent me over the edge.  I could not sleep for hours.For this, I realized that those ""flaws"" I mentioned above not only didn't matter much in how I'd rate the film, but the film probably actually needs them to get many viewers through it.I understand the storyline is ficticious, very loosely based on a true story, and that the D-Day events are very accurately portrayed, although the initial capture of the German bunker seemed a bit quick.  I realize the film couldn't be that long, but a good filmaker ought to be able to make it appear as though more time has passed.Bottom line is that I never had a deep interest in how this war was fought, but after watching this film, I found myself sobbing over the losses incurred by people who, not so fearlessly, fought for the freedoms I - and probably most of the free world - enjoy today.  I hope to see the films that other commentators have mentioned (including any depicting the Russian invasion), to read more about this battle and the war, and Godwilling, to pay my respects at the memorial at Normandy someday.  Any film that can inspire that kind of interest and have this ultimate impact earns 5 stars from me."	5.0	Impact Outweighs Flaws	2005-10-16	6	5	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3LEHXJVA9TH4F	Clay	A high standard against which all future war movies will be judged!  No way around it, this film has revolutionized the war movie genre. The plot was nothing all that new, but like the acclaimed '99 war novel &quot;The  Triumph &amp; Glory&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; possesses a  power far greater than the sum of its parts.  The horrific realism of the  film renders any other minor criticism of Speilberg's epic an exercise in  irrelevancy.  THE WHOLE POINT is to communicate the utter inhumanity of war  to millions of people, to sear their consciences to such a degree that, at  long last, a true appreciation of what our veterans have endured for our  sakes will be engraved in all of our hearts.	5.0	Stunning	1999-11-21	5	4	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A189HRCP1SRVST	Clinton Wilson	After watching the movie for my first time, I hated it. But I kept watching it for some strange reason and months later I bought it. For more then two years it ranks as my number one favorite movie. Speilberg depicts the war as accurate as it can get. During the wrath of the WWII Normandy invsion of 1944, three brothers were killed all over the world at Omaha, Utah, and New Guinea. After the mother finds out she realises the youngest son James is still alive. The army gets Capt. Miller(Tom Hanks) to take his men behind enemy lines and find the young Private before its to late. the cast also includes Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davis,  Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and Vin Dieasel. In all this movie was dedicated to the veterans. At Oscar night the film was awarded five Oscars including Best Director. It really was the winner of Best Picture Over Shakespear In Love. So see this movie. I've recommended it to more then 200 people and have seen it more then 500 times.Saving Private Ryan, see it tonight... remember it forever.	5.0	Speilberg has done it again!!!	2002-08-05	12	6	6

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Steven Spielberg I always find is better when he does heartwarming stores(Close Encounters, E.T) or action type stuff(Jurassic Park, Minority Report) but now and then he wants to go ultra-realistic and while Schindler's List is a very nicely done film, it feels its length. Saving Private Ryan is 15 or so mins shy of 3 hours but never did it feel like it.Inspired by a true story(although modified slightly), Private James Ryan is 1 of 4 brothers who are in war. 3 of them die however and to relieve the grief of the mother slightly, and maybe some good PR, they decide to send in a Captain to retrieve him and bring him home. Pretty simple story set against the backdrop of World War II and in particular the Invasion of Normandy.Speaking of which, that scene is probably one of the most realistic war scenes ever filmed. Shot largely handheld the camera is always moving and zipping around and even going underwear than surfacing. One shot I didn't like although maybe it adds to the realism is when a soldier either through bullet hits or an explosion but his stomach is slashed so he's literally holding his guts. It shows the horrors of war yes but it felt a bit too over the top, especially with the guy screaming out. It's like they're trying to make you cry and disturbed when other scenes do it naturally.The war scenes are violent and graphic yes. Soldiers are blown apart or severed in half, one gets his head blown off. It's extremely bloody but that adds to the realism, unlike Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor which was really tame considering the event, even the ""director's cut"" wasn't that bloody.As for performances, they're likable without them being too overbearing. Tom Hanks plays that kind of steadfast captain who admits now and then he's done some wrongs. Everyone else is likable too, even Vin Diesel who to me has only done 2 good performances: this and Pitch Black. The kind of breakthrough though is Jeremy Davis playing Corporal Upham, a translator/map maker taken into war and is just scared ****less about what's going on.The look of the film is interesting too cause the filmmakers color saturated the film to make it look the way it does and also cinematographer Kaminski is kinda famous for this grainy look, the film kind of looks ugly. But he did win for Best Cinematography so who am I to talk?I don't find this film to be one of those re-watch over and over like I do with Aliens or Seven but now and then it's nice to pop it in and be entertained(or is that horrified and grossed out?)"	5.0	There such a thing as TOO realistic?	2005-03-28	7	5	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1WKGADJ7OXJ32	"""comtad"""	It doesn't seem like it's been over a year and a half since Aug 4 1998. My wife said &quot;Since the kids are away, why don't we go and see Saving Private Ryan?&quot; I had serious trepidation about that. Even an ardent  war film lover such a I wasn't sure I could endure the big screen version  of what I had only read about briefly in the reviews. But I said  &quot;sure.&quot;The theater was packed and we had taken out seats in  the middle row. With popcorn and soda firmly in hand, I was set to enjoy a  nice evening at the movies. I hadn't been to the theater in many years and  it felt good just being there with its ambiance.But into the first 25  minutes of SPR, everything changed. My everyday world shattered. My  visceral senses had been pulverized. My popcorn and soda became  non-entities. And by the time the film concluded I had been changed  forever. No need to tell you why. Chances are, if you're reading this you  already know why.As long as I live, I shall not forget that evening in  any way. Since then I own a big screen TV and stereo system as well as the  DVD version of SPR. I have seen the film many times, but I tell you, there  is nothing to compare with experiencing SPR in the thearer. The sheer power  of the audio, combined with the stunning visual elements in the theater  environment is incomparable.Furthermore, I look forward to the day when  the film may be re-released in some good, independent theater. I will be  one of of the first in line. I think that if you love Saving Private Ryan  and missed the theater experience, you have missed the soul of this film. I  want to experience that once more just because I'm a glutton for  punishment. Rest assured I won't be alone.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A6UW2KEO5UOSA	"Corey Turner ""The Musician"""	Every one has the potential of making a good movie many don't use that potential. Steven really used it to its fullest and went above the call of duty. The actors did the same to give you the pain of war.This movie is another WWII film, but this one actually gives you the facts of war. You aren't invincible bullets can and will kill. Characters die in a muzzleflash of speed, main character or not.This movie seems really inspired the opening seen probably wont leave your mind any time soon. It is gory but to the veterans who fought in this war that's just how things went. This movie seems less like a film and more like a war and that's what Steven set out to do and accomplished that.The battles really get you going you will start to feel for the characters yelling out in agony. The story takes you into the eyes of the soldiers of D-day and then all over Germany. A small group of soldiers are told to search for a soldier named Ryan. As his mother is very upset knowing all her other kids died in war.The chances of young Private Ryan still being alive are slim, but the group of soldiers still wonder off looking for him.This group of soldiers experience the tragedy of loss in search of Ryan and they get at eachothers necks. The battles just keep coming from stealthy approaches to opening fire out in blind daylight. The scenery seems dusty and destroyed in debries.The amount of bloodloss is disturbing and the men who fought and died will never know if they truly won. The group has specialists such as the marksman and team leader. Guns jam on occasion and ammo runs out often. This is the most realistic war movie ever depicted.I give would give this the highest honor is story telling to date. This isn't just a rental it's definitely a purchase title.	5.0	A Not Soon To Be Forgotten Kinda Film	2005-11-21	5	4	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3I6DTU1MS2W1Y	"Corn Soup ""sick of irony"""	The best way to watch this movie is as one hell of an action film.  The war scenes are great and there is probably around an hour's worth of action in this film alone.  I have to admit, I am a little tired of Spielberg's  love of sappy music and scenes where the sole purpose is to make people  cry. The graveyard scenes that frame the movie, for example, don't really  ring true when you realize how undeveloped the relationship between Captain  Miller and Private Ryan is in the film, but the scene is somehow moving, in  an artificial way.  Also, the characters don't seem to bond during the film  as is often noted in reviews, their devotion to one another being  manifested mainly in covering each others backs in the battle scenes.  Also, there a few gratuitous political points, noted in a previous review,  that detract from the overall objectivity of this film.  If I want to be  taught a lesson by Steven Spielberg, I'll write him a letter and ask him.  Watch the movie for its fighting scenes though.  They are terrific.	4.0	A Great Action Film	2000-05-15	5	3	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AZBMMIQKBFUZM	craig a.	This movie was shafted at the 1998 Academy Awards. Just goes to show you that Hollywood doesnt have the depth to understand a film of this magnitude. Gross injustice is the best way I can describe the snub. Sure there are some parts of the film that appear to be a little unbelieveable and perhaps a bit embellished. All in all the film is an amazing portal into the Normandy invasions and spares us the Hollywood glitz that too many war movies in the past have shown. Tom Hanks best role and Stephen Spielbers finest moment on the silver screen. The tandem is golden and certainly showed in the &quot;follow up&quot; Band of Brothers. This ranks in my top 5 films of all time. Words cant express its emotional stranglehold on your heart and soul. The buzz is there will be an HBO miniseries preimering in 2005 focusing on the Pacific theater of WWII. Should make for some mind blowing viewing.	5.0	Shakespeare in Love?	2004-06-29	4	2	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	My headline offers a subjective question, but I think most people would at least agree this is one of the best war movies they've seen, especially if they have a pretty decent 5.1 surround sound system. You can't fully appreciate this DVD and movie, in generally, without the great surround this disc offers.Sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The visuals are outstanding, too, and we'll see a Blu-Ray version of this film soon, making it even better.Since the film has been out for over 10 years, there is no sense going into the story. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is today.It makes you appreciate what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, bad language and/or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, maybe the most dramatic in the history  of film.By the way, is this the best war movie ever made: yeah, I think so.	5.0	Is The Best War Movie Ever Made?	2009-04-22	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1DCX9TKR8417M	Craig Koller (u3420@lvh.com)	While the Normandy landing sequence is brilliant, the rest of the film is a run of the mill war picture.  The modern day framing device almost ruins the film with it's hokey over-the-top sentiment.  And the ending was so  patronizingly patriotic that it would've embarrassed John Wayne.  Spielberg  cleverly marketed the film as a love story to WWII vets, so who would dare  criticize it?  To do so would look disrespectful to veterans of  WWII.Even so, it's worth watching, just to find the flaws.	3.0	Good, but over-rated	1999-11-18	7	3	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	My advice is, see it in the theatre.  Watching at home, where the cat wanders in and jumps on your lap, a bus drives by in a crucial scene, or the phone rings - these things really do upset the atmosphere.  To  appreciate the movie, you must be immersed in it.  If not, you'll notice  that there really isn't much of a plot.But, the plot is not the point.  The immersion into the horrors of war, if only vicariously, is the point.  And it truly is horrifying.  The scenes on Omaha Beach were especially  effective.  The climactic battle goes a little more slowly, as Spielburg  wisely knows that we are saturated by violence at this time, and sets it  more as a battle study rather than a collection of greusome images.  In  between those two battles are a number of interesting little interludes,  some being battles, others being character builders, but all of them keep  you in northern France in 1944.As for the DVD edition, I will not  comment on the technical details, as I haven't the equipment to do it  justice.  I will comment on the included documentary, however.  I did not  find it particulary useful or interesting.  Perhaps someone with little  knowledge of the specifics of WWII operations would enjoy it, but it came  across as a sales pitch (or a rebuttal to the Academy for selecting  Shakespeare in Love) rather than a D-Day retrospective.  The making of  documentary makes the mistake of showing too many relections and not enough  technical detail - to me, these features should have shown how they made a  Tiger panzer, how they did the makeup and explosions, etc.  At least they  showed footage on the &quot;basic training&quot; the actors went through.  That was interesting.	5.0	Gripping war footage, realistic	2000-06-12	2	0	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AIC7J32QZY2KF	Craig Moller	Steven Spielberg is one of Hollywood's biggest director's and has made many great films but however Saving Private Ryan stands out from all the rest. It features some of the most violent and most releastic war footage ever filmed and delivers on giving the message that war is pure hell. The movie opens up on the landing on Omaha Beach where the Allies were being slaughtered up by the Germans forcing many viewers to look away in the 20 minute opening. Saving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war.Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action a private by the name of Ryan. His mother recently received all 3 telegrams with a chaplin and an officer arriving at her doorstep on a remote farm. Miller's men set out to find Private Ryan against all odds which features a certain style about the film that doesn't make out a typical hollywood film. This film also boasts alot of big stars including, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi and many other familiar faces.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winning Schindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose. Saving Private Ryan touches us deeper than Schindler because it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make. An unforgettable experience that won't be forgotten.	5.0	Unforgettable. Spielberg's best	2008-12-07	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ASR09IYA7HBV8	Cyrus Clennon	The only redeeming value of this film was the most hyped, that is, the first 30 minutes. After this we have a lethargic, unprovoking, 2 and a half hours of hollywood fantasy nonsense. There was apparently no script, so one has to look at the battle scenes in hope of seeing something realistic and true to history. The film fails miserably in this respect too. The germans were made to look like morons who don't follow any basic military protocol, thus getting slaughtered. Uhhhhh, weren't these guys known throughout the war to triumph in hopeless situations where they were outmanned and outgunned? The &quot;tiger tank&quot; mockups were just that, hastily dressed up t-34 russian tanks that looked something like a tiger if you looked at it from the right angle. And i found the way german soldiers were portrayed, as a bunch of mindless skinheads, to be unnecessary and irresponsible. Judging from flicks like this, america still have a lot to learn about portraying ww2 in a manner that does something else besides flatter it's own and dehumanize the other side.	1.0	NOT WORTH THE HYPE	2001-07-28	42	14	28

Akinade ""atlzfinest4life"""	As a result of the largely inane dialogue that arises out of pop culture's rabid desire to impute a sense of hierarchy to aesthetic works, there has been a stupid tendency to exalt works that convey the abstruse, the obscure, the macabre, the anti-climactic, the anti-cliche if you will. But those who say that Spielberg is overrated or lacks the cerebral auteurism of a Kubrick, the uncanny ability to manipulate suspense and fear such as Hitchcock, the lugubrious quiddities of a Kurosawa, or the romantic wit of Woody Allen, are absolutely stupid, to say the least. Spielberg is arguably the greatest director ever, and indisputably the most influential (one need not look further than the preponderance of escapist films made after the 70's). It is no mere hyperbole to say that Saving Private Ryan is the bar none the greatest war movie ever made, and probably ranks among the top 10 or 20 greatest films ever made.The movie commences with a trip down memory lane, as we see an old man and his family clearly in distress. Intuitively we must assume the man seeks isolation--affirmed by his retrospection after he sees the grave of a soldier; the connection is not yet drawn though between this old man the grave at his feet. From the opening scene, wherein the audience bares witness to the pure and undistilled brutality of military carnage, Spielberg's technical virtuosity--unmatched in the history of film making--is no more apparent than when he uses the hand-held oscillations of the camera to convey a sense of presence to the scene. That is to say, the audience feels as if it is indeed part of the calamity it is privy to. The jarring immediacy of death--a motif revisited throughout the movie--appears at the blink of an eye as soldiers drop dead without even leaving their boats, and even more glaringly as we see soldiers drown, caught in the straps of their uniform and gear. Spielberg, chided as a sentimentalist, an unfair claim espoused by many who frankly don't know what the hell their talking about (such absolute labels are silly), conjures a sense of realism one doesn't see even in Full Metal Jacket (another great war movie, that pales in comparison to this). When bullets  kill a soldier asking for advice in front of Tom Hanks, his death is not dramatized but a reminder that stagnancy in war is fatal. As for my last observation of the first scene--the piez de resistance--Spielberg curiously mutes all sound in the middle of the scene and the audience is temporarily transformed into first person viewer; cringing as men grab their intestines to keep them from falling out, recoiling as blood leaks from every orifice as soldiers run by, stunned when Spielberg, in a brief fusion of comedy and tragedy that Aristotle would be proud of, shows us a soldier with one arm turning in circles looking for his other arm. This, among many technical manipulations, represents a reprisal of conscience because in that brief 1st-person transference we are reminded of the omniscience of death and men, who must kill or be killed, die or effect death, lose pieces of their souls in war in a way that can only be shown in silence.This movie is not for the light-hearted, but violence, as many of the more acute reviewers have stated, is not gratuitous. Yes some of his movies are flawed, or are simply bad, and yes at times he values style over substance, some of which even lack the former, and yes he has made tons of money; but above all Spielberg is a genius and this movie should  be added to the cannon of unequivocally great movies made in World & American cinema. I leave with a simple message: the greatness of a movie, a director, or indeed any art, lies in its ability to change a person--to laugh, to cry, to fear is not enough. If one leaves a movie with an altered perception of things, perhaps a heightened understanding, then that work of art is indeed great.	5.0	The Greatest War Movie Ever Made...Period	2008-04-09	5	4	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2	"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru"""	A wonderful powerful start is diminished by the typical sentimentality that so often prevents Spielberg's more serious efforts from achieving greatness.  The movie would have been so much better if they had just  eliminated the subplot where they let the German soldier go only to have  him turn up again at the end, etc, etc.  If the soldier had not returned  &amp; the rest of the action went on with diferent Nazis fulfilling his  plot point honors, or even if the one American soldier who talked the rest  of the heroes into letting him go, killed the returning Nazi in a fashion  more savage than anyone expected, only to be killed himself by friendly  fire, anything to maintain the chaos of war image that shatters the  audience at the beginning of the movie.  Unfortuneately, chaos does not  reign in this movie, but B-movie sentiment does, leaving Schindler's List  as Spielberg's only truly successful &quot;serious&quot; movie.  And it's a  real shame, because this movie came very close to being great.	3.0	Ultra-realistic fight scenes undermined by formulaic plot	1999-10-13	5	2	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1DOYVFA12C0KJ	daniel	In the last film of the 20th century directed by Steven Spielberg he's lifted his craft to a new level, transending all that parody that he relied so heavily on earlier in his career.  And there's no doubt that Saving Private Ryan is the most realistic war film of all time but is it the best?  Well, let's just say it's right up there.  The fine ensamble cast is headed by Tom Hanks as a Captain sent behind enemy lines in search of a private whose lost his brothers to combat.  His mission's to lead a group of eight, himself included, and find the private so he can be sent home to console his grieving mother, for whom our emotional attachment is dependant on one minute of the films near three hour running time.  Despite her lack of development in that one moment we come to understand her devistation and don't need any further explanation.  The private's played by Matt Damon who doesn't show up until the movie's two-thirds of the way finished but his lack of screen time doesn't diminish another fine performace on his part.  The plot is interesting but can't help but be overshadowed by the fantastic battle scenes which serve as the film's bookends.  The opening act takes place on D-Day and, though I hate you use this phrase when describing the horrors of war, it's breath-taking.  The picture and sound quality are such an intical part of this phenomenal film that it should almost be a crime to watch it on anything else but DVD.  There's no doubt in my mind that the disc's quality is unparreled.  It is the best of the best.	5.0	'Saving'  His  Best  for  Last	2000-10-13	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1RO3RK9FCQRWW	Daniel	This is the best war film (or ties with Black Hawk Down) that I've seen. We start with Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller, Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Horvath. Throw in Barry Pepper as my favorite character, the hothead, religious sniper, Vin Disel as Private Caparzo, and Jermy Davis as the corpral, as they storm Dog Green sector of Omaha beach. The ramp of the PA boat drops and soldiers run out, only to be stopped by MG42 bullets, mortars blow men to bits, 20mm flaks cut the troops to peices, but, Captain Miller and his men actually survive perhaps the most realistic battle scene. . .EVER.But it's not over yet, Miller and seven other men get assigned a mission to find Private James Ryan, a paratrooper with the 101stwho lost three brothers on D-day, he has a ticket home.This is a great, probably the best war movie ever, the Omaha beach we saw wasn't real, but it looked that way. As Miller and the others find Ryan, losing two men, Caparzo and the medic, Wade. Ryan and his brothers in arms are defending a bridge, and the Nazis storm on them with infantry and tanks, and only two or three people from Miller's squad (along with Ryan) survive.I have to say, I'm not a fan of Speilberg, (I liked Minority Report), but this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A13RM1AWD1C5ZR	Daniel K.	"Saving Private Ryan is the best, if not one of the best war films ever made.  It certainly is realistic and intense enough to be.  Tom Hanks delivers a fine performance as the captain of an army unit.  Director Steven Spielberg creates the film which some say he was born to make.Ryan, starts out with the D-Day Invasion, which is filmed so realistically and is truly one of the best battle sequences ever filmed.  That scenes alone earns the film the ""R"" rating.  Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a captain in search of a private who he must find and bring back home after his 3 brothers are killed in action.  The film features an ensemble cast of great actors, from Tom Sizemore to Edwards Burns, to Matt Damon, to Vin Diesel, to Barry Pepper to Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg.  For being a 1998 release and then being re-released in February of 1999, this film does feature excellent battle sequences which are very realistic and well done for being a 1998 release.It's easy to see why this film won 5 Academy Awards at the Academy Awards in March of 1999.  It won the award for Best Director, which it truly deserved.  There have been other great war movies including Black Hawk Down, Platoon and We Were Soldiers but none as good as Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is rated R for Intense Prolonged Realistically Graphic Sequences of War Violence, and for Language.  The violence as I've stated earlier is extremely graphic, specifically the opening battle sequence of D-Day.  The violence includes guns, others explosives and explosions and knives.  The language is reasonable and not too strong or pervasive.  Spielberg's direction is assured and powerful in crafting this masterful war epic.  The acting is superb and the script is sharp.  Definetly worth owning on Video or DVD.  I hope they re-released in theatres again, because it's that good."	4.0	Saving Private Ryan- One of Spielberg's Best	2004-01-27	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1EFS5PV3HOFDI	"Danielle Muller ""Shulamith"""	If the all-star cast isn't enough to make you want to see this movie, then watching it simply because of it being a spielberg should do the trick. Hosting a round of names such as Tom Hanks,Giovanni Ribisi,Paul Giamatti,Ted Danson, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper and even Vin Diesel in one of his first real roles.For Vin Diesel fans, his role was exclusively created by Spielberg for his moments of glory in the movie. Although his role isn't as long or prounouced as more future ones, he's not hard to pick out.However I regress, for Saving Private Ryan is more than a bunch of big names in gritty war movie. Its about how the war affected the different men in different ways. The anger, frustration and fear that where such strong factors in how they communicated with each other and the enemy.Not as hardened as Platoon, but just as gritty, Saving Private Ryan is for those who truly wish to watch real movies on real events. Gore is not used with a tightfist, from the beginning you'll find blood spraying, men without limbs and stomachs torn open for all to see.Tom Hanks plays Cpt. Miller, who is sent to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon) the last of the Ryan family, his two older brothers both killed recently in the war. Leading his men on the long tramp through enemy territory, they encounter hardship and death on every turn. I don't say death lightly, for half the men don't even make it to Ryan. This causes the survivors to wonder why they are even risking themselfs for one man, a man they never met and wouldn't know if he was standing two feet in front of them.To say the ending was the saddest part of the entire movie would be doing Spielberg a diservice, not one scene goes by without you fumbling for a tissou. A classic trademark of Spielberg.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan	2005-06-17	2	1	1

One reviewer noted that there is little  character depth and development.  In situations like those encountered in  war lasting friendships are made without knowing a great deal about those  with whom you share common hardships.  What comes through, most vividly, is  that war is terrible and senseless.  Clear your mind of any pre-conceived  ideas and you will learn what war is all about.

The emotional horror that is produced by this film is awesome.  He shows the violent reality of war through a captivating story, awesome cinematography and special effects, and great acting from Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore.  It is violent and has drawn criticism for such, but as a teacher I know that the younger generation (or my generation for that matter) sometimes glamorize war.  We don't realize the brutality that it was  and Speilberg gave us a mind-blowing reminder!How in the world such a movie lost to the extremely overrated and cheesy &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; is absolutely beyond reason.

I'd heard stories about Omaha beach, but theywere very hard to imagine.  Steven Speilberg has effectively created an image that should haunt anyone who sees it.  As I watched this movie for the first time, I realized that most of the soldiers that gave their life for freedom were younger than I.  I could not imagine the fear that must have occupied these brave souls' hearts moments before the invasion.  I'm grateful for the sacrifice that they made, and I wonder if I could possibly make the same sacrifice.  I like to think that I could, but there's no way to know for sure until you're presented with the opportunity.  Thanks to these brave men, I'll probably never be presented with that opportunity. The other day, I saw a display that asked for money to fund a memorial to honor these brave soldiers.  I gave every penny that I had in my pocket, a sum that amounted to about six dollars.  I slept very well that night, knowing that I had given money to honor the bravest people that I'll never know.  Every time I see one of these displays, I make a point to donate whatever I can.  I hope that you'll do the same.	5.0	Please donate to the WWII Memorial fund	2000-05-07	5	3	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"Since ""Schindler's List"", it has slowly dawned on me that Steven Spielberg may be our greatest director.  The commercial successes of his early career may have soured some to his artistry but let's face the facts.  Spielberg has tackled films from varied genres and has succeeded in most of the endeavors he has attempted.  In the pantheon of Spielberg's successes I place ""Saving Private Ryan"" a notch below ""Schindler's List"" not on the strength of Spielberg's direction but on some inherent weaknesses in the script by Robert Rodat.  The film opens with an elderly Private Ryan at the gravesite of his fallen comrades in Normandy flashing back to the D-Day invasion(how can Ryan flash back to this? He was a paratrooper?).  The re-enactment of the invasion of Normandy Beach may be the most powerful scene ever transferred to film.  After, opening your film with such an effective salvo how do you top it?  Well, there is a story to be told.  Captain Miller(Tom Hanks) is given an order to locate Private Ryan, who lost three brothers in combat, with the aid of his charges behind enemy lines and bring Ryan back home.  For the most part the scenes involving Miller and his men involve the debate as to why it's so important to find Ryan and more importantly why we're fighting this war.  Miller's squad consists of the usual multi-ethnic types including a pacifist (Jeremy Davies) who is supposed to provide counter-point to the pro-war sentiment.  Intermittently there are skirmishes to break up the monotony.  Once the men locate Ryan (Matt Damon), the results are somewhat interesting, to some disappointing.  Aside from Spielberg's solid direction, what bonds this film together is another sterling effort by Tom Hanks (yes, he is our greatest actor).  He perfectly captures the essence of a man who would rather be home teaching in Pennsylvania but inherently understands the reasons for his fighting and maintaining the morale of his men despite personal doubts of his own. While I stated up front that the film is slightly marred by inconsistencies in the script, there is no doubt as to where Spielberg stands on the righteousness of waging this war.  Ultimately, this film is a tribute to the servicemen who selflessly won this war."	5.0	Powerful Tribute to the Servicemen of WWII	2004-10-08	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Shortly after the D-Day invasion of Normandy, a group of soldiers are sent on a propaganda mission to retrieve a man whose bothers have all been killed in the war.  They struggle with the morality of risking the lives of their whole unit to save just one man, but they carry out their duty.  There are some amazing action sequences in this film, most notably its famous Omaha Beach battle scene.  However, it is also a deceptively complex film.  The carnage of the battlefield is juxtaposed with the quiet offices of Washington DC, where decisions are made that lead to still more carnage.  In one scene, the men, only a few days removed from the horror of Omaha, catch themselves behaving in an extremely insensitive manner while digging through the dogtags of dead soldiers while the survivors look on, making the point that personal experience of battle does not necessarily result in a heightened sense of empathy for one's fellow soldiers.  This, in turn, adds another dimension to the scenes of the decision-makers, battle veterans themselves, who are willing to risk lives on the basis of sentiment.  Yet, at the same time, who could fail to appreciate their heart-felt desire to rescue Mrs. Ryan's last son and return him to his mother?The character of Upham (Jeremy Davies) is particularly fascinating.  Many viewers will probably dismiss him as a coward and that is unfortunate.  I'm sure that there have been innumerable times that men have frozen during battle when decisive action was required of them, costing lives as a result.  These men were not necessarily cowards, but merely unprepared for and overwhelmed by the magnitude of what they faced.  Director Steven Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat have presented a character that can be identified with rather than the cartoonish craven chicken-heart that many lesser films have settled for.Spielberg, Rodat, stars Tom Hanks and Edward Burns, and everyone else involved with this production are to be commended.	5.0	Action-packed, but thoughtful	2002-04-12	1	0	1

The current generation only hears  how evil and politically incorect war is in any circumstance, but fails to  understand how evil the tyranny and oppression was in this instance and how  much more difficult Nazi-Germany would be to endure a cold-war with than  Soviet Russia over the remainder of the Century.

I literally had to build myself up emotionally before I could see it and even though I knew what to expect, I still found it hard to watch the horrors of the landing. I finally saw the movie in the theater and refcently bought the DVD. Believe it or not, I skip a few chapters ahead past the landing, I just can't rewatch the awful carnage .. it's just too powerful. What I particularly like about the movie is that we get to know the characters in the expedition to save Private Ryan and we identify with them &amp; mourn when tragedy befalls any of them. When the Jewish character struggles in an epic one on one struggle with a German soldier, it is emotionally powerful. I find I literally feel I am that character and I am involved in the struggle.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A33YB7WJN7U355	David	First let me go over the pluses to the movie.  It had incredible camera work and the characters had some(but not much) depth to them.  After this I  have exhausted the movies upside.  The germans were portrayed a mob of  trigger happy idiots.  The americans were'nt much better.  In the beggining  scene when the invaders are mowing threw the barbed wire as easy as can be,  that is completely unrealistic.  Also when the allied bombers came overhead  at one of the bridge scene and the germans ran, that was not only  unrealistic but to me a movie-destroyer.  It left me with a bad after taste  in my mouth.	3.0	good, but needs some work	1999-10-25	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"Steven Spielberg's 1998 World War II epic pays due homage to the heroism and sacrifice of those who served in the European theatre of the war.It begins with the titular character (Harrison Young) visiting the American cemetery at Normandy with his family, five decades after the main events of this story.Upon finding the grave of a fallen comrade in arms, he falters and must be assisted  by his family, including his wife(Kathleen Byron) as the review of the events leading to his safe homecoming begins.On that fated Tuesday, June 6, 1944, we see Captain John H. Miller( played with all due charisma by Tom Hanks) leading forces ashore on D-Day, which is accurately depicted as a choppy ride, complete with motion-sick combatants and shaky  camera shots that give a realistic view of combat from the combatant's viewpoint. Soon, all the noise, confusion, and grimness of combat come into play.One striking aspect  of this color reenactment of the D-Day Invasion is that the reason why most photos of  the Normandy Invasion are in black and white:  Presumably so that the public wouldn't see how  bloody the water was during that event.It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase, ""Crimson tides"".Mills disembarks on a beach covered with the wounded, dying and dead.We view the hideous reality of one soldier picking up another's severed arm, and another soldier struggling to hold in his exposed intestines as he pleas for help.Meanwhile Washington D.C., General George Marshall (Harve Presnell) learns of the deaths of three Iowa brothers--the Ryans, and of the existence of a fourth brother( Matt Damon) who parachuted somewhere behind enemy lines.After receiving orders to locate and retrieve  Private Ryan from the front on D-Day plus 3, Miller designates six men from his company for the mission, including sharpshooter Private Daniel Jackson( Barry Pepper), Technician 4th Grade Irwin Wade( Giovanni Ribisi, who previously appeared with Hanks in ""That Thing You Do!""), Private 1st Class Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel), Private Stanley""Fish"" Mellish(Adam Goldberg), Private 1st Class Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), Technician 5th Grade Timothy E. Upham(Jeremy Davies), and Technical Sergeant Mike Howarth(Tom Sizemore).There is some reluctance to go on a mission to find one man who may or may not even be alive.But Miller  assures his men that if finding Ryan is the task that will send him home to his wife, he is willing to go through with it.There is the brief perspective of the homefront where Mrs. Ryan(Amanda Boxer) is shown on the day she receives  her son's death notices at the family's Iowa farm.The unit on the special mission to bring home her last remaining son will endure fierce combat, two casualties, and challenging encounter with a civilian family caught up in the fighting, a confrontation with a lone German soldier(Joerg Stadler) to whom they show mercy, a misleading encounter with the wrong Private Ryan(Nathan Fillion) before they learn Ryan's true whereabouts.When found, Ryan is initially reluctant to go, feeling that he should stay with the only brothers he had left and that his family's triple tragedy should not give him a free pass, earning the ire of one member of the unit, who informs him that two men died in the search for him.Ryan has a change of heart, goes with the search unit and the men endure many fateful encounters before the story comes to its conclusion.Ted Danson appears as Captain Fred Hamill, Leland Orser as 2nd Lieutenant De Windt, Max Martini as Corporal Fred Henderson, Dennis Farina as Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, Paul Giamatti as Staff Sergeant William Hill, Bryan Cranston plays Colonel I.W. Bryce, Dale Dye is a War Department Colonel, Ian Porter plays Private Trask, and Demitri Goritsas is Private Parker.Based loosely on the story of the Sullivan Brothers, this story features all the realistic grittiness of war, and presents audiences with a fuller truth about war than its 1962 counterpart, ""The Longest Day""."	5.0	In the Land of the Crimson Tides	2014-06-06	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A14ZEKREPLVJWJ	demerius	I love a good action flick, but what I hate is pretense.If someone or something oozes too much sincerity, we suspect something else is going on. Often, but not always, those suspicions are correct.Just who is glorifying war here? Spielberg is. His message is this: &quot;You want a war movie? I'LL SHOW YOU A WAR MOVIE!&quot;.Look at all the violence. Isn't is awful? Look at it again.  Hey, one more time. Wow. Nasty. Excellent. I can hardly take my eyes away!And, so we don't feel guilty about our bloodlust, he does it all under the guise of it being a &quot;tribute&quot;. In fact, Spielberg revels in the violence, and he takes us along for the ride.If you doubt that, then ask yourself if you watch the movie for the aggressive stimulation it provides, or to really contemplate some of the horrors of WWII and the sacrifices &quot;our boys&quot; made. Most guys will watch repeated viewings for the action.We're being seduced. The viewer from Ridgeway, Ohio, talked about Montgomery and Eisenhower &quot;and their blind, military cronies ... glorifying butchery and population control in the name of 'patriotism'.&quot;That's exactly what's happening here, only on film. How long before a different director wants to top it?Oh, and why are Matt Damon's teeth so white?Sarcasm aside, I agree with Dennis Littrell's review. Spielberg is at his best when he entertains us with luxurious action sequences, and stays away from questions of morality,  (regardless of Schindler's List, which is also deeply problematic).Subtle the man is not.	2.0	We're still the Romans in the Coliseum.	2001-01-05	13	5	8

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A19ZD3R0BQT2IC	Denis M. Mcdowell	"This film is kind of like the CD you buy for two or three good songs. The combat scenes are fantastic, but the story is devoid of any sort of character development. The characters are a bunch of cliches (the tough kid from Brooklyn (where else?), the Sniper with a southern accent, the ""tough as nails"" Sergeant with a heart of gold (hmmm, maybe Whoopi could have played that role...), the philosophical soldier, and the Jewish kid fighting the Nazis.The ""bookends"" of this film (the Matt Damon character at the cemetary) is pretty heavy-handed as well, I found it hard not to laugh when the old guy went through the whole ""tell me I'm a good man"" thing.The staging of the combat scenes is amazing and worth the price of admission, but don't expect a great story. At least not one as good as the real thing. Stick with ""Band of Brothers"" for a better narrative."	3.0	Great combat...not a great movie....	2004-06-02	15	7	8
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3UW23DBF2KHWC	Denis Vukosav	"Saving Private Ryan is first cooperation of director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks as main actor.Hanks plays Army Captain John Miller, whose unit is charged with searching and safely returning the last survivor of four brothers serving in World War II. The opening battle scene depicting the Allied landing at Normandy beach set the new standard for all war films to follow with its frank and brutal depiction of the horrors of war.The mission to save Private Ryan is a grueling and emotional one, resulting in one of the best World War II movie ever made.This movie is the technical masterpiece, with its battle scenes, special effects, sound editing and camera work probably cannot be compared to any other.For some characters it's fair to say more development would not hurt but some of actors very overlooked like Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath.John Williams' score is great, especially the final score ""Hymn for the Fallen"". This is a excellent piece of music which does honor to men pictured in this movie.Speaking about this DVD edition, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you are not going to fully enjoy this movie. Sitting in a room surrounded by six speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - either in that spectacular 22 min opening scene or in the final 45 min of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. Lot of movies seen but never saw so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good - perfect colors for the bombed French city where final hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the soldiers, the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, and evertyhing else pictured.This is a tough movie, showing the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is memorable would not be enough, for sure one the greatest war movie ever made. I highly recommend this movie."	5.0	Spielberg's masterpeice...	2013-07-07	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ALCTVUGB5WZG1	Dennis J. Buckley	_Saving Private Ryan_ earned much critical acclaim and reviewers are still emoting over it.  Some of this is deserved, but much of it reflects the ongoing guilt-complex and moral confusion that post-Vietnam America has  with respect to war as an instrument of foreign policy.  Regardless of the  &quot;cause&quot; most people do not like being drafted and sent to far  away places to kill or be killed.  But this goes to the central flaw in the  film: the main players are NOT just draftees.  They are volunteers in two  elite units: the Rangers, and the 101st Airborne.  In this sense, the  somber, fatalistic tone of the film really jars.The first 20 minutes or  so of _Saving Private Ryan_ are five-star and beyond.  I generally stop the  tape after that point.  The fact that the soldiers of the United States  Army won the battle at Omaha Beach tends to obscure just how amazing this  feat was.  Spielberg's treatment of one of the Rangers' attacks near  Vierville (the visually more spectacular escalade of Pointe Du Hoc is  treated in _The Longest Day_) is literally stunning.  It is also socially  significant in that it [finally] gave some of the members of the post-WWII  generations a small sense of what our fathers and grandfathers endured in  the world war against ethnic imperialism and race hatred.But then the  tone of the film changes.  It acquires the fatalism found in the memoirs  and interviews of draftees.  This is in sharp contrast to the elan of elite  units like the Rangers and the 101st Airborne.  This &quot;gloom and  doom&quot; atmosphere renders the rest of the film one long funeral  procession which ends, appropriately enough, at the American war cemetery  above Omaha Beach.  It is more Paul Fussell (&quot;Wartime&quot;) in tone  than Steven Ambrose, the noted historian of D-Day and the War in Europe  (&quot;Band of Brothers&quot;).Perhaps the truest moments of the whole  overblown &quot;rescue&quot; mission are these: Ryan's dismissive reaction  to the mission-- he unequivocally refuses to &quot;bug out&quot; on his  buddies, who truly are his brothers; and Upham's freezing on the steps when  decisive action could have saved Mellish's life.  The latter strikes me as  an example of an incident that only a combat veteran could fully understand  and that haunts a man down through the years.I have heard _Saving  Private Ryan_ described as full of stereotypes and  &quot;meretricious.&quot;  That seems a bit harsh.  The film is worth  seeing, and worth owning.  But it should not be the only account of D-Day  or of the war in Europe that &quot;under 20s&quot; ever see or read.  This  is only part of a much larger story.  _Saving Private Ryan_ is simply not  the end-all-to-be-all that many gush over.  It is a very good movie, but it  is not the best, nor is it the first, to convey a sense of the horror of  combat or the loss of loved ones.	4.0	A good movie, but neither definitive nor the best.	2000-06-09	20	12	8
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"Tom Hanks is excellent and his character is nicely developed, while the action sequences are second to none.  But ultimately ""Saving Private Ryan"" is like so many war movies I saw as a kid, regardless of how well rendered.  The opening scene (after the shlocky frame) as they storm the beach at Normandy is pretty awful.  You get the sense that a nation shows its resolve by how many of its young men it is willing to sacrifice.  Just throw the bodies out there.  In Kosovo we held that number to zero.  Such a lovely way to fight a war.  In WW II the number was, however many it took.  Says something.  Spielberg makes this point with the wide-angled shot of the channel filled with Allied landing craft and support vessels for as far as the eye can see-a scene incidentally right out of Frank Capra's seminal series ""Why We Fight"" to which this film is indebted whether Spielberg acknowledges it or not.World War II was a war so horrible and so all encompassing that to this day we really don't understand it or comprehend it.  Spielberg thought he was being ""objective"" in showing war ""as it really was,"" with Americans murdering prisoners and vomiting from fear and dying like cattle without a chance (something Capra of course was not able to do).  Yes, but to show the ""saving grace"" of individual valor is to perpetuate the war system, because that valor is a fraud.  It was not the bravery of our soldiers that won the war.  Just as it didn't matter how brave or how cowardly the soldiers were in the landing craft, it was the sheer volume of them that prevailed.I think as long as one believes that individual heroics amount to something we will have war.  Spielberg no doubt thinks he has shown us the horror and waste of war, but while plying the trade he knows so well (seducing the audience) he has trumpeted the glory of war, that old fraud, and so he is just like the rest of the proselytizers, only more skillful.Still it is impossible to say what is right.  If we had not won WW II the world today would be vastly different.  Totalitarian, imperial, repressive, racist regimes in which the state tortures and enslaves the people would have prevailed.  They may have nuked one another by now and we could be living in the rubble of a bestial existence.  Who knows?  Thank God for the United States and its incredible industrial capacity, because that is what won the war, not individual heroics, much as our tribal minds, along with Spielberg's, would like to believe such fairy tales."	4.0	Frank Capra updated	2000-11-18	12	6	6

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AXMPBUWHJGHGO	Desperado	"This is one of those movies that recieved a lot of praise from the vets who were there. Also more than 70 critics e.g. time magazine; USA Today etc. who named this movie in the best picture catigory. it also won 2 golden globes and 5 oscars in 1998. But there are those few who also condemn the film for either its [...] story line or historical inaccuracies and so on. But now let look at the film fair and square.Plot: By now everyone knows this, a captain and 7 other men is assigned to rescue a paratrooper name Pvt. James Ryan (after a bloody landing at Omaha Beach on D-Day) who lost three of his brothers. Hence a Public relation mission.Now for the good parts that were offer in this movie is its technical achievment in sound effects as well as visual effects which played a major part in the first 25 minutes in the movie at Omaha Beach. Then again the sound effects and visual played a major plot to keep this movie up. What will happen if we removes those two things? in my opinion this movie would just be another ""typical war movie"". Spielberg was wise in using a special camera in this movie which gave the picture quality a rather a ""documentary look"" to make the movie more spectacular which is a great artistic touch.Not every one likes the plot of the movie. But this is loosly based on an actual event (not involving any one name Ryan).One serious drawback is the despiction of the German soldiers. THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME (bald heads). that is why I took a star off. Look in the history books they do not look like that. In fact they had hair (Most of them). They were also younger at the time.Also a little bit of patriatism was shown  Without those flaws, this movie is almost perfect Should you see this movie? Well I should say yes, despite the problems this film has, it is worth to watch but be warned, it is graphically violent. Enjoy."	4.0	My Opinion,	2001-07-20	1	1	0

What I mean to say is they are not overdone or  underdone --- they are just right for the movie.  The characters are  interesting, and the acting superb.  I think every senior class in high  school should watch this movie every Remembrance or Memorial Day.  They  will never let their country go to war again.  All in all, a superb movie.	5.0	Boy, what a movie!	2000-02-26	1	1	0

It's definitely not for the faint-hearted, especially the first 25-30 minutes.For many years I considered THE LONGEST DAY, the best film about the Normandy invasion during WWII.  That was an excellent film for its time, but this Spielberg production takes the invasion & ensuing days to a much more intense, gut-wrenching level, with a story that not only is based in fact but also shows the horrors of combat in a way that few films ever have.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN develops the characters in such a way that any harm that befalls them has a greater impact on the audience than most war films.There are a number of breakout performances by this star-studded cast (Sizemore, Diesel, Pepper, Davies, Goldberg, Ribisi) with some fine ""cameos"" by Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dale Dye, and Dennis Farina, to mention some of the more better known actors.  Tom Hanks EARNED his Oscar for best actor.  His performance as Captain John Miller was BETTER THAN ""spot on""; it was masterful.While other excellent war films have been made since this one was released in '98, such as BLACKHAWK DOWN & the HBO series BAND OF BROTHERS, this one will rank at the top of anyone's list of gripping war stories for years to come.The extras in this set are top notch as well.

I have had 3 copies, all with the same glitch at the 22-26 minute mark. There is a white hazy glare which distorts the picture (flames have lines in them) in this section at the bunker atop Normandy beach. There is also the same white glare distortion at the end of the film where Oppen (Jeremy Davies) arrests the Germans. I pretty much expected a flawless print as all the DVDs I have purchased have been so. I'm wondering how many viewers have noticed these flaws.	3.0	Movie Great...DVD Flawed	2000-12-02	8	4	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2EIEXQVCPXZNG	Dimitrios	"I came to see Spielberg's film without expecting anything special or groundbraking but the movie is without a doubt the best war film ever made, even though some expert critics disagree in favor of older films. Spielberg did an excellent work giving the full sense of battle horror and, in my opinion, he achieved the top mark in war movies combining some really fantastic abilities: he filmed most of the battle scenes from behind the shooters, he never used an immobile or standing camera, he had terrific sound effects of the weapons and the sounds of battle, he took extra care to trivial details like uniforms, hair cutting, weapons, sweat, blood etc., he presented German (and Waffen SS soldiers in particular) in a marvelously authentic way, he built his story with an excellent pace and he communicated the real stress and nerve racking of close combat to the people who never had to live through this experience. Most critics praise the initial 20 minutes of the film, when the Normandy landings are realistically presented in the infamous ""Omaha"" beach, and although I agree that this is the best landing sequence ever put to film, I think that it is unfair to underestimate the last climactic battle of the movie in the half destroyed French village, where the agony of the uneven struggle against a numerically superior and fanatical enemy (and far better armed with the full panoply of war tools) makes a real war thriller. The fans of military history will find no better war movie and no other screen spectacle better manipulated than this one, created by the ""magician"" Spielberg at his prime."	5.0	It deserves many more than just 5 stars!	2004-10-04	8	7	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1K5FY9JGGCPX9	"Diogenes ""searcher for truth"""	"I lost an uncle and a cousin to that war, both dead before I was born.  My Mom taught me to pray for them as a boy, and I found myself connected to them as if I had known them despite them being KIA in 1944.  After talking to some of the vets who fought in their units and survived, and talking to my own father, a Marine, another cousin who flew in B-17s, and my Father in law, who also fought from North Africa to DDay to the end,in all the European campaigns, I found a deep respect for the things they went through.  And those I talked to, to a man, never bragged about any of their medals or valorous deeds.  ""I was just doing my job"" and ""The real heroes didn't come home"" are among what I was told.  Of course, some came home wounded for life, and some despite not being too badly injured, were mentally scarred(like my Father in law, who often during the 60 years afterward, woke up from sleep screaming and wet with sweat)Seeing in 2002 the actual D Day and other European battlefields, where one can still sometimes find over 60 year old bunkers, parts of the Siegfried line, grenades, bullets, parts of uniforms, and other military detritous, makes me wonder how any of them ever were able to come home.  We have a duty as those who came after them to both honor them, remember the hell they endured to give us what we have, and to never let the evils that led to that horrible war fester and grow back into a new conflict.As to the movie, the hell the vets and the fallen endured is like no movie can ever convey to viewers.  But it's the closest, based upon what I've been told, and what I've seen, we'll ever get to being among those men who went into that war.  I can tell you, from hearing from a man who saw and witnessed my uncle die after being strafed by machine gun bullets, and seeing the movie, that the deaths depicted were very close to real.  While the constant re-playing of this masterpiece have made it, for me, somewhat more movie than real, as I felt seeing it in the theater, it still packs a punch, visceral, and for anyone who hasn't yet seen this, please watch it on DVD uninterrupted.  As one who has lost two close family in that war, it is so close to what I saw and have heard that I can't help but cry every time I see it...it brings home those sacrifices given by young men a long time ago and gives those like me a way to mourn them. And I find that helps me to do justice for them. Even if you're too young to have a direct connection to WW II, this will help you to step into their shoes for a couple of hours and then realize what they did for you.  It in no way ""glorifies war"" but does give us a sense of appreciation, which is much needed.  A wonderful work of art; I can't see why it didn't win the Best Picture award that year."	5.0	It Speaks for Those Who Can No Longer Tell Us Their Story	2010-12-12	3	3	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	When I first saw this film, it was at an industry preview prior to the UK cinema release. The consensus of many after viewing it was that it was too bloody, and they were unsure as to who the audience for it were, and who would want to see it.Yet such was the calibre of the film, a day or so later these opinions had mostly been revised, and it was felt that this was indeed a WW2 film which packed a powerful message.From my perspective, Saving Private Ryan works brilliantly in its depiction of war. To capture the fluid and chaotic reality of battle, Spielberg used hand held cameras as opposed to fixed. The effect is dramatic, giving the viewer the sensation of actually being in the battles depicted.Moreover, the viewer is plunged into the realities of command and control in such a situation, and the reality dawns that the notion of officers controlling a battle from its midst is an implausibilty. Instead battles are depicted from the viewpoint that once you are engaged, then it is the acts of individuals in the moment that make the difference. Spielberg tries to depict officers in control eg Tom Hank's character, the SS officer in the Tiger tank but the result is that they are part of the proceedings as opposed to being the controllers. While many old soldiers have faulted technical aspects of the film, they largely agree that it one of the few films to actually depict in a realistic fashion, the confusion and chaos of battle. This realisation also makes the viewer understand how in such chaos so called 'friendly fire' deaths can occur.Nor the film does not hold back on its depiction of carnage. The landing at Omaha beach shows men being ripped apart, disembowelled and dying young soldiers are seen crying for their mothers, and men missing arms are seen staggering around in shock, looking for their missing limbs.Allied troops are shown disregarding the Geneva Convention when it suits them. Immediately after the German positions at Omaha have been overrun, some US troops are depicted mocking, and then shooting dead German soldiers who have just surrendered to them.Again full marks to Spielberg for having the courage to show an ugly and shockingly human response from men who have just fought a vicious battle and seen many of their comrades killed by the same soldiers who now want to surrender.The last battle in the film depicts a battle between US troops and armoured German units comprising of Tiger tanks and Jagdpanzer Self Propelled Guns. The tanks are depicted as ugly, iron monsters whose approach makes the ground shake, inducing fear in the soldiers as they approach. The result is a mix of the real and surreal which works stunningly.Like the landing at Omaha beach the ensuing battle is depicted as chaotic and random, and following no particular pattern. The acts of individuals at certain points determine the outcome as opposed to planning, direction, and strategy.What denies the film five stars in my opinion is its characterisation. Tom Hank's school teacher turned army captain is not particularly believable. His platoon have so many fractious characters that in real life, they would struggle to achieve the required cohesion of a fighting unit.Put that aside though and you are left with a fine war movie which packs the timeless message that war is an horrific experience for the particpants. It is as simple as that.	4.0	Ugly and shocking depiction of war	2005-01-26	9	6	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AVCRD98TH48RN	D. Knouse	"Mr. Spielberg won his second Oscar for Best Director for this incredibly detailed War epic.  I'll start off with a minor negative criticism.  The main story that ensues after the D-Day invasion is a little thin, and it carries on to the end without much in the way of sub-plot.  However, that is the only negative I can find in this otherwise remarkable film.  I still find it needling that this film lost the Oscar for Best Picture to ""Shakespear in Love.""  ""Saving Private Ryan"" did win 5 Oscars, 4 of which were for technical achievements: Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound, and Sound Effects Editing.  The 5th Oscar went to Spielberg for bringing all these great elements together.  For the most part the acting is solid, with only a couple standout performances.  Tom Hanks is good here, without ever becoming overbearing in the midst of the chaos.  In fact, his character is more self-reflective and philosophical than is usual for a lead character in a War film, which makes his performance all the more interesting.  His performance was the only one here that was nominated for the Oscar.  But there is one performance here that should have been recognized as well.  Tom Sizemore, always the professional supporting actor, is the tough-minded soldier holding everyone together with his immense presence.  He has yet to disappoint me in any of his films, but if I had to choose my favorite from all his roles, his work here proudly stands out.  The realistic battle sequences are intense and terrifying.  There is one scene in particular that invokes dread every time I watch it.  It's a hand-to-hand knife fight in a small room that is so unnerving that I'm getting chills just relating the scene.  No one is coming to either combatant's aid, only one will come out of the bloody situation alive.  At one point the American soldier tries to stop the fight through reason, where they could both stop and just end the fight.  I was hoping for that positive outcome, but it never arrives.  That is just one of many gut-wrenching scenes.  This is a far cry from the John Wayne era of films like ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" where the men get shot, no blood is to be seen anywhere, and they fall over dead.  For what it's worth, ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" did use some authentic stock-footage edited into the film for more realism.  But it never reaches the graphic reality of ""Saving Private Ryan.""  This is a technical masterpiece from one of the greatest film directors of all-time, and quite possibly the greatest War film yet made."	5.0	"""Maybe you should just shut up."""	2004-03-04	2	2	0

I doubt I can add a new angle, but wished to express my thoughts regarding this exceptional Steven Spielberg film.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN must be the most realistic war movie ever made (and no, I've never been in combat, yet I feel very comfortable that the sights, sounds, grit, grime, tension, brutality, and horror of actual battle are aptly conveyed in this epic); it's all the viewer can do to get through the first half hour, an unbelievably gruesome and violent depiction of D-Day.  Spielberg definitely hooks his audience, even though (and I've seen this film several times) I find myself grimacing and looking away from some of the most disturbing carnage.We all know the story:  A platoon is dispatched deep into Nazi France to find, and then remove, a Private Ryan (Matt Damon).  This is a PR move by the War Department, as Ryan's other three brothers have all been killed in action.  The journey to find Private Ryan's outfit, and then one final confrontation with German forces before Ryan can be removed, is riveting, compelling, horrific--poignant.  The action is powerful but never pretentious, and once again, extraordinarily realistic (including a knife fight when a German soldier, his face dripping with sweat, attempts to calm his American victim as the knife enters his chest).  All of the cast is exceptional, headlined by Tom Hanks as platoon leader Captain Miller--an everyday man just trying to hold his group together and make it to the next sunrise.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is an elite epic, and when combined withSchindler's ListSpielberg has paid everlasting homage to World War II.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning	5.0	Tremendous	2009-08-06	4	3	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1M0JC9UFG6Z44	"""dna-groove"""	The horror scenes of people being shot to death or severed of certain limbs are indeed cruel and even disgusting at times, but it's not the disgust that these scenes visualize, but the horrors of war. These scene are there to make you understand what the American WW2 soldiers went through to defend and protect nations outside the US. The horrors are indeed hard to take in, but as soon as these are over, new horrors lurk in the next scenes. Emotional horrors. The tension of getting yourself killed at any time.It's not about horror, it's far from it... it's about a family with no father that 3 out of 4 sons were killed in the war, and the youngest is to be saved by a group of unique and wonderful soldiers. It's a beautiful story, beautifully told. I loved that movie, seen it 5 times already and nuking some more popcorn to see it again. :) Highly recommended.	5.0	Requires patience... which pays to its last ounce.	2000-10-15	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2NWMKTGGROUM8	"""doctor_smith"""	"Any critical interpretation of Spielberg's heavily problematic ""Saving Private Ryan"" is bound to provoke passionate, even angry, responses; some people defend this movie as religiously as they defend other American myths. To attack the film is to commit blasphemy, supposedly tantamount to attacking America's role in World War II.  But a critical account of this overblown epic war film has nothing to do with the history of World War II.  They are separate issues, and it is possible to critique this film while still holding that America had a special role in the defining historical moment of the 20th century.Now that this necessary caveat has been made, let the critique begin. ""Saving Private Ryan"" has all of Spielberg's trademarks, which means it has all of his drawbacks: it's emotionally simplistic and shamelessly sentimental to the point of being offensive (the prologue and the coda at the veteran cemetery are the best examples, as are the musical cues noting when you should feel sentimental); it's deeply manipulative, as are all of Spielberg's films, save a small few (like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""); it offers only a watered-down, massively unsophisticated interpretation of reality, in this case of World War II, portraying the Nazis as cartoonish villians (they were villians, to be sure, but there was nothing cartoonish about them in reality); and it is technically astute but dramatically under-whelming.  The last point here is important because much has been made of Spielberg's recreation of the Normandy invasion, seen as impressive in its realism and its scale. But despite the technical bravado and the sheer amount of work that went in to pulling the scene off, Spielberg approaches the invasion with all the subtlety and seriousness of a child.  There's little here that is dramatically compelling, and most of the opening half hour actually has no weight -- it's showy and comical and contrived just enough to be trite. As a result, it has an effect opposite to what Spielberg surely intended.The rest of the film suffers from similar problems.  On the surface, the idea of focusing on a small band of soldiers and their efforts to rescue the last survivor of four brothers in order to understand the war as a whole (sort of a microcosm as a lesson) seems intriguing and notable, but Spielberg, in typical fashion, can't pull it off.  This novel idea, in his hands, gives us no real sense of what the war was about, what was at stake, what sacrifice really meant; under Spielberg's direction, World War II becomes indistinguishable from any other war, nothing more than a bunch of soldiers who want to finish their mission so they can go home, nothing more than a reductive tale that includes some vague notions of good, evil, heroism, and fear.  The story meanders without force, to the point where it's difficult to care what happens, which might not seem like much of a criticism until we realize that caring is the one thing Spielberg wants us to do.  And if that weren't enough, the film's final sequences entail a climatic battle against Germans that has all the originality, thoughtfulness, and profundity of a typical Hollywood action climax.  Sure, the bullets whiz, blood spurts, soldiers fight for their lives, and then the audience cheers loudly when something ""good"" seems to happen, as if cheering at war is the thing we should really be doing.""Saving Private Ryan"" is, at best, a severely flawed and problematic film.  Even the cinematography, which has been praised too often, is wrong; the flat hues and dark colors don't fit, and Spielberg, as well versed as he is in the art of movie-making, could still learn a great deal about handheld camera work from a number of directors and cinematographers, including Truffaut and Kalatozishvili.  He's a technician, to be sure, but that does not mean that he makes the right decisions.Finally, the DVD as far as quality goes is impressive, but in some sense this film would be better served if it were played endlessly in a hall at Disneyland instead of home theaters; because ""Saving Private Ryan"" approaches its subject as a child would, and therefore would be perfect in a place devoted to children."	1.0	Saving Me From This Movie	2002-12-26	72	28	44

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A27TNGYCGOD82R	"Donald Gansberger ""Semi-grown child prodigy"""	"I remember working in the DotCom field in the Silicon Valley, going to see this movie on opening day. Like most hot-headed nerds in the valley, I ran my mouth off about accuracy in movie-making, nitpicking it, and generally being a loser after the movie was over while friends smoked cigarettes in the parking lot. An old Vietnam vet walked up to me, obviously shaken by what he had just watched and calmly, succintly, and tersely put me rightfully in my place. Now, nine years later, and two combat tours along the most hotly contested areas with the Taliban in Afghanistan later, I can say he was right. This movie touches so many nerves, makes things so real, I am at a loss for words. Languages - all of them - fail to express our emotions at their peaks and valleys alike, and as such, the feelings this movie bring forth of memories of loss, courage and brotherhood are all too real.I'm not a WWII historian, so obviously, not an expert on the accuracy there. But the portrayal of the men, while limited in depth compared to the intimacy of knowledge men have of each other in real combat, is accurate, and I am an ""expert"" on such a thing. It's like modern war video games in that the actual simulation of combat itself is NOT accurate, but the emotional experience that it offers you is. If you want to watch a movie and have a reaction that really is indicitive of what it's like to witness front-line combat, I don't think any movie ever made has really come close to SPR.What really got to me was the German captive. There's nothing quite as telling as the human face of the enemy, and the disastrous effects of sometimes doing the right thing - but it's still the right thing.I love this movie. Spielberg is a wonderful human being for making this movie. I can have my parents watch it; their fathers, who were there in WWII, and their son, now at war himself - this film puts it all in context. I don't even need to say a word.Thank you, Mr. Spielberg."	5.0	Experience	2007-11-23	5	3	2

The story of  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is of a soldier whose brothers are all  killed within days of each other during world war two. Out of compassion  for this soldier's relatives, Private Ryan is ordered by the government, to  be returned to the USA so as to be with his relatives in their time of  grief.  A squad of eight men led by Captain Miller (played admirably in a  sober and sombre performance by Tom Hanks) set out to find Private Ryan at  the frontline. As in the parable of the lost sheep, this small group risk  their lives for one man's life, only to find Ryan is infused with a  remarkable sense of duty. &quot;Ryan: You can tell her (Ryan's mother) that  when you found me, I was with the only brothers I had left. And that there  was no way I was deserting them. I think she'd understand that&quot; A  masterfully told story and a timely reminder of how well served the world  can be by a nation dedicated to democratic ideals.	5.0	Major Miller - &quot;Earn this&quot;	2000-05-27	2	1	1

If any one is of age, you will remember all of the Sullivan boys were killed on one ship.  This why this is taking place..Also, brothers are never all together to this day.  The question is, &#34;why are 8 men risking their lives to save one.  Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer -- and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage.It is a very powerful movie.  You see actual pictures through out this movie.  You want to cry because of what all of our soldiers went through to keep us all free. Thanks to them I am free.	5.0	Why I like this movie	2014-06-07	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1VKT6RZ1T91I1	Doug Hillman	I find it somewhat amusing to read all the previous reviews of this movie.  &quot;Where are the British?&quot; &quot;Where are the African-Americans?&quot; &quot;Why are the Germans portrayed so  steroetypically?&quot; &quot;What about the landings at all the other  beaches?&quot;  My personal favorites are the couple of comments that point  towards &quot;Apocolypse Now&quot; as a REALISTIC war movie.  Heheheh.Folks, this ISN'T a movie about WWII.  This ISN'T even a movie about the  D-Day landings.  This is a film about a group of soldiers from a US Army  Ranger batallion who are sent on a PR mission shortly after landing at  Omaha beach.  There's your reason for no British soldiers.  Not many of  them serving in US Ranger batallions now is there?  Also the US forces were  still very segregated at that time.  The film's just telling it like it  was.  Steroetypical German soldiers?  In what way?  They spoke German?One clue to the power of this film is the fact that different groups see  it in different lights.  The pro-military faction sees the patriotism,  honor, duty, etc. in Capt. Miller and sees Jim Ryan as Why We Fight.  The  anti-war people see the film as a depiction of the senselessness of it all,  the terrible terrible violence, and both the mental and physical horrors  that war inflicts upon men.I feel that this film depicts the realities  of combat and what it does to men better than just about anything made  previously.  The tension, the bonding, the bravery, the cowardice are all  there.  The only flaw I find are the tacked on opening and ending pieces.  They seem like afterthoughts, there to appease someone (who though?  Studio  heads?  Moviegoers?  Veterans?) and were unnecessary to the story and in my  opinion took away from the weight of the ending.  I cannot give the film 5  stars because of these small scenes.  I would prefer to be able to give it  4.5, but don't have that choice so 4 will have to do.	4.0	What is everyone looking for?	1999-12-14	15	12	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3VRZXFICISV5E	Douglas J. Rathbun	I must say that when Saving Private Ryan came to the cinemas, I wasn't compelled to go see it. I usually avoid films that have hoards of lemmings camping out to see it (read SW Episode One). Pvt. Ryan had been on the  video shelves for a few weeks before I picked it up. I wasn't really  looking forward to YAAWF (Yet Another American War Film).This film is  absolutely brilliant filmmaking. If Speilberg had not made ET and Indiana  Jones, he would not have had the creative control to make a masterpiece  like this. He reminds me of Hitchcock at the height of his powers in the  late 50's early 60's.This film is riveting from beginning to end. Every  scene, every shot, every sound has meaning and is seamlessly integrated  with the overall artistic vision of the film. I have a degree in Film  Criticism and have seen a lot of film. You quickly become jaded by formula  after formula.Speilberg has created a fresh approach to what could be  considered a tired genre. The hand-held, chaotic filming of the Omaha Beach  landing along with the sizzling soundscape make this sequence one of the  best in cinema history. The point, however, is not to bombard the viewer  with gory war scenes for shock purposes. It is a setup for the rest of the  film. You are never at ease at any time for the rest of the movie. The  payoff for this setup is the sequence towards the end of the film in the  battle to hold the bridge.One beautifully crafted sequence (of many) is  setup in the opening sequence crossfade from the old man's blue eyes to Tom  Hank's shaking hand at the Omaha landing. That crossfade is a film  convention that Speilberg subverts for dramatic effect. When you see the  final crossfade from Pvt. Ryan's face to the old man's face (beautifully  done) it comes full circle. This subversion of a typical film convention is  what makes Tom Hank's final scene so incredibly moving. You'll know what I  mean when you've seen it.Speilberg has gone beyond technical mastery of  film, he has become a consumate artist, using his film making skills with  intelligence, sensitivity and confidence.	5.0	Brilliant Filmmaking	1999-12-17	1	0	1

But ""Saving Private Ryan"" is much more than that, as it gives us a well-developed story line and characters we come to care about during the natural unfolding of the story.WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?:After landing on Normandy through the most visceral and graphically-realistic re-creation ever put to film, this ensemble of American soldiers and the film itself slow down to catch their breath and hand us a great story, having now prepared us for it. The heroic ""everyman"" types that comprise this small band are fleshed out as they go through their mission to find Private Ryan. It's a sort of follow-the-yellow-brick-road-to-Hell kind of mission that is just about impossible for them to reconcile. What is so important about Private Ryan? See the film and you will find out.BOTTOM LINE:Action, drama, and morality are all mixed together in the cauldron of wholesale killing that was the second World War. The ""right thing"" to do is very difficult to decipher, both by these soldiers and by us viewers, but in no film is the topic more in-your-face realistic and emotionally-supercharged.After seeing the Normandy sequences in this film, such similar epic recreations as in ""The Longest Day"" seem not just tame, but also emotionally-removed and from a safe distance. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best and most captivating films of any genre that I have ever experienced.----- CASTTom Hanks - Capt.

Everyone of us who saw this in real life were left crying messes by this movie.  No one  would think of offending the victims of rape, molestation, child torture or  other hideous violence by making a &quot;technically perfect  rendition&quot; of it so others could &quot;enjoy the gore without the  fear&quot; or offer insipid reviews about character development as if no  one died for their freedom to do so.  This movie is a slap in my face, a  crime, and grossly insensitive to all who fought for their country.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2BL39YCWZ46LT	Dustin A. Schroeder	I owned the VHS of this, and then the DVD, and now the Blu Ray ver. I looked and saw some other people were saying that the blu ray looks like the DVD. They are very wrong, maybe they are watching the Blu Ray on their grandma's old tube TV but there is a very noticeable difference. The actor's uniforms, the dirt crusted into their finger nails and face. The particles and fragments flying around after an explosions and bullets wizzing by all bring this movie to a new level. I have a pretty decent surround sound that blew me away. With the visuals and the amazing sound I felt like I was running around with them, taking cover while enemy fire was cracking by my head. Was just simply awesome. I highly recommend this Blu Ray. If you are even thinking about getting it, do yourself a favor and just get it. It will not let you down one bit. Oh and another issue people are having with Sync problems and halo's around the characters, I have had none of these issues my ver. is just perfect.	5.0	Felt Like I Was Saving Private Ryan (Blu Ray)	2010-06-14	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A15SOUD8XGOYOR	Dutch	Saving Private Ryan was a good movie. Realistic sound effects, a must for any good movie. A good story line, keeps the viewer engrossed. The battle scenes were well done, but a little unrealistic. Like the Germans  constantly running directly into the American machine gun lines of fire and  being killed. The Germans always being outsmarted by Captain Miller. I must  say the Germans didnt shoot back very often in the movie. In reality the  Germans had machine guns in World War 2 and used them. This movie doesnt  give the Germans the respect they deserve. They kept the Allies box in at  Normandy for weeks after D-Day and this movie portrays them as unorganised  rabble which was not the case, the total opposite. Still despite some  oversights it was a good movie.	4.0	Saving Private Ryan - DTS	2000-04-07	4	2	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AT2BYFEVLVITT	D. Wetzel	Saving Private Ryan feels so real at times, you think you are in the middle of a battle. The action sequences are extremely intense, and are not for the weak of heart. Before this movie I really thought war was more  glamourous and simple. Speilberg has opened my eyes, and showed me what war  really is, brutal and dehumanizing. I couldn't even imagine having to go  through with that in person. Everytime I see the movie, I wonder, how would  I react in a situation like that. Thankfully, because of those men and  women who sacrificed themselves, I can live in a place were i don't have to  worry about such things. The movie is very moving, and should be seen by  everyone.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AI43VKPN5NF7D	"Edd Anderson ""ezduzed"""	A Classic, film worth the money to be able to enjoy it at any time and quality,  is excellent. I am adding a film or two from all the wars, that gives an excellent portrayal. Also considered are ones like this that the direction, story and acting all are right on.Having visited all the D-Day landing sites the surrounding areas and the American Cemetery in Normandy, was one of the most amazing weeks of my life. Going over the annual celebrations adds more as every place a Canadian died is marked with a Statue or plaque and flowers, the larger the monument and amount of flowers indicates how many died there. I was there in Normandy over the D-Day period and through the Summer Solstice it is a wonderful time to visit Normandy. But it can get chilly and be prepared for  some rain, but a great place to visit and you will see how in some places the vistas look similar to what you see in this film.I have to say in this area you will see a lot of things from vessels to vehicles and a lot of British and American Flags, the one thing I heard was for years many of the vet's  returned for the festival and every year fewer Vet's made it to the celebration. But photos and history is everywhere, while the this time of year its light till almost Midnight, Museums and  such close at normal hours. And I was comfortable in France and made to feel welcome, in Paris I think people are so involved with themselves they are rude as a way of survival. New Yorkers will feel at home with the Subway's, though clean Restroom's some even work's of art, are a bit of a mind blowing experience.	5.0	One great Movie, a great story and wonderful presentation.	2014-03-30	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3H8UWPV5ACZ1H	"""edjonesthegreat"""	Saving Private Ryan is a movie that we have all seen too many times.  It is a war movie with a lot of action and a lot of patriotic babble.  Tom  Hanks plays the humble man who is a teacher turned soldier and who  apparently believes it is honorable to fight and kill in a war for the sole  purpose of going back home again.  The enemy are portrayed as heartless and  evil, with one german prisoner behaving like a circus freak.  The  Americans are stereotypes: tough guy, bookworm coward, humble leader,  religious guy, city guy, etc.Although the opening scene is brilliantly  filmed by Spielberg, 15  minutes does not make a great movie.  And as for  its supposedly realistic portrayal of violence?  Obviously the violence is  meant  to appeal to action/horror movie fans.  I know college age guys who  watch the movie just to see the blood and gore.  So when you come right  down to it, all this movie has going for it is depiction of death in war.  Each soldier's death is meant to be even &quot;cooler&quot; than the last  one.  This is a brilliantly filmed melodrama that has a pitifully weak  story and a muddled message.  The most offensive thing, I believe, was  ending the movie with  an American flag waving proudly, as if to suggest  that the death of millions of innocent young men can be justified by a  symbol.  If Americans want to continue to think of war as honorable, then  maybe we should start another Civil War...it would surely inspire  countless films and endless entertainment for fans of graphic violence.	1.0	Spielberg's Patriotic Propoganda	2000-09-19	82	32	50
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2762TE6MXGRHT	edmoney	I will follow up with a real review in the future.  For now, I wanted to  answer a question posed by an earlier &quot;review.&quot;  Someone asked  whether the German soldier captured and freed (by Miller and his men during  the assault on the machine gun nest) is the same soldier who kills Private  Mellish with the knife in the final battle - the answer to that question is  NO.  I also wondered the same question and recently came across a book on  war movies that addresses that very topic.  If I remember correctly,  Spielberg clarified that point and also acknowledges the possible  confusion.  After all, both soldiers are similar in appearance with the  same haircut.  In retrospect, though, the soldier who killed Mellish has a  more hardened, chiseled look whereas the soldier from the machine gun nest  has more of a &quot;weasel&quot; look.  The demeanor of the two also  differ.Now I would like to pose a question to those who own the DVD  version of this movie.  I've tried out 8 different copies of the DVD and  each one freezes for a full second near the end of scene or chapter 12.  It  occurs right after the machine gun assault scene where Corporal Upham  questions Miller about killing the German prisoner.  After Miller tells him  that he can help bury the bodies, the screen freezes for a full second  during the close-up of Upham's face.  Does anyone own a copy where this  doesn't occur?  Any feedback would be appreciated.	4.0	Answer to question previously asked followed by new question	2000-09-07	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AS07Y8XNLXE2H	"Edward Barett ""Music predator"""	"When i first watched this move at the cinema, i could only retain two parts of it: the first 20 minutes, with the introductory 10 minutes being really intense, and the last 20 minutes, thanks to the sound of a detonation which plucked me from the lethargic state of half sleepiness, half tiredness i was in. But as everybody hailed the movie as being great, awesome, terrific, a masterpiece, etc. i realized it must have been a mistake, i mean, the effect of the movie on me, what a shame. I rented it two weeks later and gave myself a chance for redemption, and again it happened: this time i resisted, shook my head, washed my face, et caetera, but i then clearly realized that, apart from the first and last stages, the movie is utterly boring.Or at least, that's my impression.Technically, the movie is good in some parts. The action portrayed at the begining is quite decent, with some vivid details such as the ""deaf moments"" aiming to bring us closer to the sensations of a real war. The sound was great. That's why i give it two stars.Apart from that, the movie is a waste. The plot is simplistic and unrealistic; to believe that some ""Department of War"" have taken the trouble of detecting, days after the ""D"" day, that some guy was the last living descendant of an honorable, patriotic and all-commited-to-the-country family that have sent all their five children to the miseries of war , and decided to set a mission to rescue this ""private"", it's rather absurd. The characters are hollow, you don't get a chance to get involved, psychologically, with any of them. There's not the slight intention to make an insight of ""why we are here, searching for what, for the sake of who"", it's all superficial. Merely simplistic, just an assembly of guys with a mission assigned: to rescue the innocent good while killing the ferocious bads. As simple as in a Batman comic. And the bads are the archetype of evil, the perfect bad guys, so they make the task of killing them really easy and remorseless.Fortunately, great movies like Stalingrad and Apocalypse Now have shown us that war is more than a collection of guys with lethal weapons sweeping around other guys, labeled as ""bad"". There you get in touch with the concealed part of the war, emotions and feelings which also count. Saving Private Ryan smells like propaganda. Like brain washing. Like manipulation. It could have been a great movie, because technically speaking, it is quite well done (screenplay, etc.) but it ends in being rather pathetic."	2.0	Rather pathetic	2010-10-22	31	5	26

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A4FAPQKQQLJY1	Elite	While watching this movie again, I was reminded how amazing it was. I hadn't seen it for awhile, but after the D-Day scene I was just glued to the screen. Even know I knew what was going to happen, it was just like watching it for the first time again. This is an absolutely amazing flick that has to be seen.The story of a small platoon of marines travelling across France trying to find a Private James Ryan, is an interesting one. For the four of you who HAVEN'T seen this movie, James Ryan's three brothers were all killed in battle. The government has now sent a group of soldiers to go find the fourth brother and bring him back alive. The story is based around a Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad of marines.This is not just a action/war movie. Yes, there are many battles and they are very well done. The D-Day invasion at the beginning of the movie is one of the most famous and incredible scenes in movie history. The end battle is also a great piece of movie making. But, there are many scenes used to develop the characters that you spend 2.5 hours with. It has heart and action. Which in my eyes, seperates it with many other war flicks. This is probably my favorite Spielberg film and I think I wouldn't be alone on that thought.The acting is superb. Hanks, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and others are at their best. Hanks, of course, steals the show as the lead here. He is probably the best actor of my generation and he was on a serious role during the late 90's. I have always thought Burns was a bit overrated, but he is impressive here. Damon has some very good scenes, but he isn't in the movie till the latter half. Sizemore and the rest of the platoon are all memorable and likeable characters. Once again, Adam Goldberg makes me laugh out loud and he should be in more movies.There are many moments where I was surprised by the nice shots that I was looking at. There is one shot where the guys are walking at night and the explosions off in the distance light up the screen. It is an absolutely amazing shot and there are many more of these moments in the movie. Spielberg really impressed me with how he shot this movie. Is has it's grainy, washed out look while still looking gorgeous at the same time. Like I said, Speilberg was at the top of his game here.Is this the best war film ever made? Well, that I don't know. I think Platoon and Apocalypse Now are also very good. This movie just has more heart and substance to it. It looks amazing, sounds amazing and the acting is top-notch. The story is very interesting and it has the best of the best directing it. You can't go wrong here.Special Features: Well, we finally have a special edition of this flick. The only features here are several featurettes on the making of the movie. Ran together, they run about 90 min. in length. It's very well put together and I guess I couldn't complain too much. I was just hoping for a little bit more considering all of these supplements could have been in the first release of this movie. And if there was any movie CRYING to have a commentary, it would be this one. I do like the features here, but it is ultimately disappointing.	5.0	Best War Film Ever Made?	2004-09-18	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ATP54STCHAQ4Z	Ellen Bainer	As has been mentioned countless times, yes, the picture quality and color are wonderful in this movie. That is about it. Although Spielberg does an excellent job of replicating a wartime scenario, he does not utilize it as  a vehicle to promote understanding an any way. By endeavoring to create a  &quot;War&quot; move, whatever that means, it is the director's  responsibility to treat it with care and maturity. With the inconsistent  directing style and wooden performances of the actors, the only thing that  seems to be spent on this movie is a lot of money (as upposed to time and  thought.) If you wish for a better understanding of human nature and  intellectualism in the Wartime setting, try Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red  Line, or perhaps the first half of Full Metal Jacket, made by directors  that know what they are doing.	1.0	GREAT FOR ALL YOU SUB-MORONS OUT THERE....	2000-04-11	45	12	33

Trying to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, I saw the movie twice.  Coming to  the sad realization that there wasn't one, not one african-american face in  this movie.  Not dead, alive or wounded.  This cannot be an accident.  Why  is it so hard to give credit where credit is due.  The year 2000 is here,  and this kind of thing shouldn't still be happening....The only reason I  didn't rate this movie a zero is because of Barry Pepper's portral of Pvt.  Jackson.

This film can't be compared to any other films because it is so well done.  It is not a &quot;movie&quot; but a window into what war is really like.  It does not make war, in any way, seem positive but seems to explain the unsurpassed bravery of all those young men who died for us and our freedom.  Just as they died for us, so has Christ died for us and OUR FREEDOM from satan.  He saved us and bought us at a high price.  All we have to do is accept his gift to us.

I'm, of course, talking  about our 75 to 90 year old national treasures that are about to be gone  forever.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A228NBNLYJ8V3J	Eran Cohen	I've tried for quite a while to find a tagline for this movie. The one I've found seems appropriate ,I believe it sums up the essence and the messages of this extraordinary movie.Yes, it's one of my favorite movies , I don't know anybody that hasn't seen  and admired it . Well, it's for a reason. No movie (that I know) from the last decade conveys the horrors of war in that explicit, down to earth, realistic way. While seeing it for the first time my heart ached, I felt so much grief over all the men that'd died in World War II, and in all the wars, for that matter.In this particular case, this war was unavoidable, and these men were fighting for the most noble reasons . I felt throughout the film in great debt to all those soldiers that had fought the nazis, and helped shaping the world as we know it today .When Captain Miller'd said in the end &quot;Earn this ,earn it &quot; I felt like it was addressed directly to me, and that as a person that has earned the right to live thanks to the western victory ,should I transcend myself from all those pitiful everyday problems of mine to accomplish something good, real good in my life.  I've thought a great deal about it in the couple of years since I've seen the movie . I have this notion in my mind, and I'll keep on trying.One cannot refer to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; without praising the sublime soundtrack composed and conducted by John Williams. It's my all time favorite soundtrack, I've listened to it more than any other disc, never getting enough of it. Williams succeeded in seizing the entire diversity of emotions ,feeling and sentiments the movie had delivered in the best possible expression. I admire his creation as much as I admire the movie ; It's so touchy and delicate ,that in the first times I've listened to it ,I couldn't stop the tears out of dropping down my eyes .&quot; Hymn to the Fallen &quot; cannot be left unmentioned . It's the most intensive track ,the main theme ,if you may .I haven't heard anything that meaningful ,similar to this masterpiece (&quot;Symphony of sorrowful songs&quot; by Gorecki is an exception and has transcendency of another scale). I could actually hear the mothers cry with anguish and pain in the peak of this creation. If you haven't heard it yet, it's an imperative you won't stay indifferent to it's majestically crafted tune.Another genius part of the movie music ,unfortunately ,left out of the soundtrack ,is the song &quot;Tu Es Partout&quot; by Edith Piaf. The song integrates so harmonically with the progress of events in the movie ,that you can't help yourself from falling in love with it instantly, unquestionably. A true brilliant choice.Then ,coming downright to the essence of the movie ,you're left with the distinct feeling of sorrow and pain over all the dead, wherever they died .The scense of death is strong in this film ,the realism is the highest I've ever encountered. This is a great achievement of Spielberg, the director, and I think that he's accomplished his initial goals with this astounding film .In the end, owning this DVD is an obvious act ,and the first one to buy if starting a personal library. Every penni justies it's expense .	5.0	Uplifting ,and,at the same time ,saddening, so saddening .	2000-10-28	2	1	1

This version surpasses that since it shows the real horrors of D-Day as it was 6th June 1944. Not for the  squeamish!

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	"When Saving Private Ryan first hit the theaters, a big splash was made over the amount of graphic violence the film contained.  As a matter of fact, such hype over the movie's gruesome nature overshadowed most other aspects of the film, and since then, there's been a small critical backlash of sorts against the movie, many claiming it's just another example of Hollywood junk.But after so many years, my appreciation for Saving Private Ryan has only further solidified, and in spite of three terrific war films released the past year (Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Band of Brothers), none of them have been able to surpass SPR on the pure basis of emotional resonance.  For that, if nothing else (and you'd best not forget how shatteringly realistic the battle scenes are), this is the greatest war film ever made.The film's opening D-day sequence is easily the most highly praised segment of SPR (or any film released that same year, for that matter), and it's no wonder.  The invasion is a twenty-minute display of confusion, bloody death, and the overall terrifying realism of combat.  Prior to this, I'd never seen combat presented in such a graphic, ""you are there"" nature that dwarfs even the stellar work Oliver Stone accomplished twelve years earlier in Platoon.After this gutsy opening sequence, we settle down to the main story.  After it's discovered three brothers have been killed, a mission is quickly formed to find and retrieve the last brother, James F. Ryan, so that he can be sent home in one piece.  Eight men, led by Captain John Miller (played by Tom Hanks), are sent for this task, with some of them questioning the logic and ambiguity behind such a mission.  The majority of the film is spent developing each of these characters, both in their interaction to each other and how war has changed the men they once were.Director Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job crafting the film as both an anti-war piece and as one that honors the men who fought and died in battle, and it seems this portrayal of heroism has often been reviewers' most listed complaint, as they seem to believe doing so makes the film into an attempt to glorify warfare.  But the fact is, these ordinary men were heroes, and prior to SPR, I'd never seen a movie that truly acknowledged their courage in the midst of unbearable chaos.  This same theme is also the driving force behind the almost as effective Band of Brothers, so it's no surprise Steven Spielberg was heavily involved in that miniseries.Camraderie on the front lines has been done to death, but its presentation in Saving Private Ryan is worth noting, and these are really the scenes that entice me to another viewing (since watching the battle scenes again would be too disturbing).  Every actor here delivers exemplary performances; this is the most terrific ensemble I've ever seen compiled in one film.  As the lead, Tom Hanks turns in one of his best performances, a dramatic tour-de-force that works simply because he so convincing plays a normal man driven to the extremes by war.  This is probably Hanks most subtle and moving role to date.  It certainly helps he has a well-written script (courtesy of Robert Rodat) to back him up.Everyone else also make good impressions, with Tom Sizemore as Hanks' loyal sergeant, Barry Pepper as the religious sharpshooter, Adam Goldberg and Ed Burns as somewhat sarcastic naysayers, Jeremy Davies as the frightened corporal, and Giovanni Ribisi as the thoughtful, introspective medic.  It's because of the characterization that I find the film's climactic battle sequence to be even more intense and moving than the opening segment.  Just watch and see if just the mere sound of thundering, approaching tanks doesn't get your heart racing in fear.On a technical level, only the pickiest of nitpickers would find flaws.  The production is amazing, consisting of war-torn towns and muddy forests.  The cinematography and editing is among the best I've ever seen, and John Williams' score is a powerful, sorrowful elegy of quiet, rumbling emotions.  Arguably, this is Steven Spielberg's best film, and whether or not he goes on to surpass it remains to be seen.  But hey, five years prior to viewing Saving Private Ryan, I remember telling myself, ""there's no way he'll ever make another film as powerful as Schindler's List."""	5.0	The war genre at its very best.	2002-11-23	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	As Stanley Kubrick, Sam Peckinpah, and Oliver Stone have showed before, war IS hell--not a glamorized John-Wayne-beats-the-bad-guys cornball cliche. And in 1998, after all the glamorizing of war by actors like Arnold Schwarzenneger and the like, Steven Spielberg joined the fray with his incredible epic SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Though bookended with the aging Private James Ryan and his family visiting a war memorial in France, the film opens with a stunning recreation of the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, where thousands of troops storm Omaha Beach, led by such fine actors as Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, and Edward Burns. Before they even set foot on the beach, however, the German guns on the top of the bluff overlooking it open fire, and instantly it becomes a firestorm of ferocious proportions, with much in the way of blood, gore, and painful death.  This stunning sequence, lasting some twenty-four minutes, ranks right up there with such films as THE WILD BUNCH and FULL METAL JACKET for depicting the sheer horrors of war.The bulk of Spielberg's film focuses on Hanks leading his platoon into deepest Nazi-occupied France on a mission to save a young paratrooper (Matt Damon) who has lost three brothers to combat in other theatres of World War II and has now been given his ticket home. One may not think this makes for a very good or even exciting movie in conventional action terms. As for drama and characterization, however, it is splendid. The siege of the bombed-out French town that concludes this film is nearly as good as the opening D-Day storming.Spielberg humanizes his characters as he has done in virtually every film he has made; we are made to care about these men and what they stand for. In the end, this makes the violence and death of war much more painful to contemplate than the glamor of a Schwarzenneger or a John Wayne right-wing tract. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is, incredibly, yet another masterpiece from the pre-eminent American film maker of our time.	5.0	War IS Hell	2001-08-29	15	11	4

SPR shows the true face of war and the destruction to mans psych, as the soldiers go from the beaches of normandy through the Eurpeon countryside.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2ZA8YN1GD1NQT	Evil Pope	"No, the title of this review isn't joke but this movie is definitely an insult to the classical movie ""The Longest Day"".Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks joined together in making this ridiculous revison of history. First they had to get rid of all other Allies (Brits,French Resistance,Poles...)who also took part in bloody fighting around Normandy. But that was just the beginning...Apart from more blood and violance this films offers nothing more than scenes stolen from comic books which Steven had read when he was a kid and was playing war all the time. Here we have a basic plot in which diehard soldiers are searching for certain Ryan and then die protecting him from idiotic,brain-washed and head-shaved Jerries. Their leader (Tom Hanks) is also despertly trying to find Johny Walker (read :a good old whisky).How else explain his ""cunning"" decisions (sending his only medic to charge on Germans) and why his hands are often trembling.But what made me laugh the most are those Irish soldiers badly disguised as Germans. They look like some strange mixture of sadistic neo-nazis and a mob of cowards. They charge disorganized and die like flies or flee like rabbits.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2UYXNDGENSAMK	Fabio Ornelas	Saving Private Ryan is, undoubtedly, a well done motion picture that depicts faithfully the sad reality of a war: it is full of blood, explosions, fire and mutilated human bodies. Although its screenplay lacks originality, since this kind of treatment given to the story is common among movies concerning war, Saving Private Ryan has many qualities: excellent direction by Steven Spielberg and great performances, specially by Tom Hanks; breathtaking cinematography and sound effects that bring the war out of the screen while the camera moves in a dynamic way and blood and water splash over it; realistic makeup and art direction that make us feel the pain and chaos of those who share the horrors of a war; and an original dramatic score composed and conducted by John Williams.But if there is one feature that calls attention is the patriotic appeal of Americans present in this motion picture: the eminent presence of the waving American flag and the idea of risking lives in behalf of the nation, which makes the reaction of Private Ryan kind of surreal, as Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) says in the movie.	4.0	A well done motion picture	1999-11-29	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A39GPMAOFOIRCP	Filmbuff (rockyone@aol.com)	This is one of those movies that, when it's over, makes you feel physically exhusted. One of, if not the best war film ever made. It's easy for some to say that it's a typical Spielberg film, made to manipulate your  emotions, but those people don't see any deeper into it. &quot;Full Matal  Jacket&quot; was all bravado, no emotion. &quot;A Thin Red Line&quot; was  empty, with no direction. Maybe &quot;Das Boot&quot; and &quot;Bridge On  The River Kwai&quot; can stand next to this one, but few others can even  approach it's greatness. Every teen who thinks the army would be a fun life  should be forced to watch this. The realism goes beyond what any normal  director would consider. The only downbeat is the heroic death of Hanks,  romanticised for the Hollywood crowd. Goes to prove why Spielberg is the  premiere director of our, and maybe of all, time. Definitely the best film  of 1998, despite what those morons in the Academy say.	5.0	An emotionally draining film	1999-09-20	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A16HJ1HKZAF9BF	Fiona	I watched this movie some time ago. Thinking about it now, I realized that while a lot happened on screen, I don't remember most of it. Why? Because the film's action was mindless.There is nothing wrong with realism or grit. But there is something wrong with realism or grit if it isn't advancing the story's ideas further, if it isn't moving the characters or the viewers along. As it stands, what I had in my mind at the beginning of the movie was exactly what was there at the end. I came in, like most, with knowledge of the horror of WWII, and all the movie did was affirm this knowledge. I didn't learn anything from this movie; there was nothing in it that made me think and reach new conclusions. After watching it, I knew nothing more of men's motives, or soldiers' lives, or the impact of conflicts on psychology, or history, or contemporary politics, or ANYTHING. I can forget it entirely, and be none the worse off.	1.0	Serious subject matter doesn't automatically make movie good	2005-03-25	75	20	55

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	This film has been mentioned as the greatest WWII film of all time.  It  was very good, but nowhere near that good.  It probably qualifies as the  one of best WWII films made after 1970.  There were dozens of great films  with better stories made in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's when the war was  still fresh in everyone's minds.The story was about a rescue mission to  find a paratrooper behind enemy lines and bring him back alive, because all  his brothers had been killed in the war.  The platoon was commanded by  Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) who had to take his men through enemy  controlled territory to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon).  It is a  combination character study and action film, more about the platoon than  about Private Ryan himself.  Other than Captain Miller, there wasn't very  much character development, but there was a good deal of time devoted to  the human dynamics within the platoon, which was excellent.What really  stands out about this film is the direction.  Steven Spielberg has created  probably the most gut wrenchingly realistic war movie ever made.  The  scenes on the beach at Normandy were terrifying.  This should be required  viewing for all politicians and generals before we commit men to battle.  Spielberg's attention to detail and willingness to show the grisly and  horrifying results of men being thrown into a fusillade of projectiles is  unparalleled.The entire ensemble cast did a terrific job.  Tom Hanks,  as always, was masterful as Captain Miller.  He struck just the right  balance between the sympathetic commander who understood what his men were  going through, and the hard-nosed military man who had to force them to do  a job they didn't want to do.I rated this film an 8/10.  It wasn't the  greatest WWII story ever told, but it may have been the greatest telling of  such a story.  This film shows explicit battle scenes that are brutally  gory.  It is definitely not for the squeamish.	4.0	One of the most realistic WWII movies ever made	2000-09-10	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2ZGUG3CHXPS9V	"FooFighter0234 ""a.ka Jen"""	"I first saw SPR back in April of this year in my 11th grade History class, and it stunned me.  Even now I still get chills thinking of some of the scenes.  The opening landing on Omaha Beach and the scene where Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) gets stabbed were enough to give me nightmares for weeks afterwards.Even so, I wanted to see it again, not for the blood and gore, but for the characters.  Wade was the one that I identified with the most; the kindly medic would do anything to save a soldier, even when he was already gone. The two parts that really have stuck with me are the scenes where Medic Wade and Private Mellish die, mainly because those are my favorite characters (yay for Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg!!).Wade's scene had me in tears; it was so touching how they were trying to save him. Even as he was going into shock and hallucinating, they kept up a steady flow of chatter to distract him as they put pressure on the wounds; it made me cry even more as I heard what Jackson was whispering to him as Wade was fading out of consciousness: ""shhhhhh, you'll be alright, Wade... shhhhhh..."".  It was beautifully tragic how Jackson comforted him in his last moments, whispering to him and rubbing his forehead.And the other scene (Mellish's death) was an absolute knockout.  He's fighting this German SS soldier guy, and he gets overpowered and pinned to the floor.  As the soldier starts to kill him, Mellish pleads for his life, and do you know what that soldier does next? HE SOOTHES HIM AS HE STABS HIM TO DEATH! ""Give in . . . you have no other choice ... make it easier for both of us...the war is over for you. Shhh. Rest now...shhhhhh...""  That one scene made me so sad and angry at Upham for being a coward and not helping Mellish that I wanted to break something.Everyone in my class thought Corporal Upham was a cowardly [...] who should have been shot when they got a chance, and I agreed with them.  But I could also identify with him.  He was relatively new to combat and inexperienced, scared of what he had to do.  If I were him I'd be scared too.This movie has shown me what war is really like; it's hell on Earth.  The glossed over Hollywood fluff of war movies of the past is dead to me.  I've always been a very empathetic person, and I was warned before watching this that it would be very VERY gory, and if I needed to, I could step out and get a drink of water.  I didn't leave.  I watched through clasped hands, biting my lip to keep from crying; I didn't close my eyes to the horror.I would have to say that EVERY high school student in the United States should see this movie; if not all of it, they should at least watch the opening beach landing scene.  Teens these days are so desensitized to violence that they don't know what real violence is.  This movie will change their minds.  I know it changed mine."	5.0	absolutely stunning	2006-05-19	5	4	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A354XWINL88Q8R	Forest Garner	The first fifteen minutes of this film are some of the best cinema ever made.  It was downright frightening, as was the intent.  The sound effects were an improvement over previous movies I'd seen, and this does a lot to  put you right there amid the action.  When you see it, note the sound of  the German MG42 machine guns and the crack of the bullets.  Nice job.  Of  course, the carnage was trimmed for the sake of brevity.  In the movie,  Omaha beach is taken in 15 minutes of Hell.  Historically, it took most of  the day, and casualties ran into the thousands.It then transitions to an  interesting, but not quite outstanding, fictional story about saving the  last son of the Ryan family.  A Civil War letter from Abraham Lincoln is  read during the movie, a letter which was so moving that I played it over  and over.  The reading isn't bad either.The characters are good, but a  bit shallow and predictable.  The Germans are just a little too evil,  definitely the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  Does Spielberg understand the  difference between National Socialists, who condoned and orchestrated mass  murder, and German Nationals, who defended their nation as almost anyone  would?  If not for these weaknesses, I'd give it 5 stars.Despite these  minor weaknesses, the story is very interesting and, as a big bonus,  educational.  I was very moved by what a generation of Americans (and those  of other nations also) went through to liberate Europe.  Spielberg made the  movie, but the courage and toughness of depression-era GIs made this movie  possible.	4.0	Excellent and Intense	1999-10-16	6	5	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	Telling an amazing story of bravery, Saving Private Ryan is both inspiring and moving. Beginning with the invasion of Normandy on D-Day June 6, 1944, the film follows a group of American soldiers as they look for a Francis Ryan. Since all three of his brothers are dead their mission is to find him and send the private home . Despite the dangers and the subsequent deaths of many comrades, they finally complete their mission after one last heroic fight. The movie flashes forward to the present day Ryan as he kneels at the graves of those brave men who saved him. Unsure he asks his wife if he lived a good life because those soldiers payed the ultimate price for him. With director Steven Speilberg, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and other good character actors, this is a powerful war film with great battle sequences as well as amazing heroism.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan (1998)	2013-06-01	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1VU8D2148AKAG	Francisco Pizarro	"As far as I'm concerned, war films are divided into to periods: Pre-Ryan and Post-Ryan. That is pretty much it. This film is that important.Before private Ryan war films (specifically WWII films)were very different. I'm not saying they weren't good. Some were awsome and a few downright classics but looking at it from Saving Private Ryan's perspective, it almost seems like they were movies about wars that never happened.In those movies, your survival depended on whether you were a good soldier. If you were good, no one could touch you. In those films the good guys were good and that was that. Nothing that could shine even the slightest sliver of moral ambiguity would show up. In those films, the bad guys were robots with no souls who were intent on destroying anything resembling goodness. For millions of people, this is the way WWII was fought.Then came Saving Private Ryan.This film showed war as it had never been depicted: The reality of it all.(As many veterans have confirmed through their reaction to the film)The films first set piece, in which the 2nd Rangers storm Omaha Beach in Normandie is an unflinching and brutal wake up call. Good soldiers, extraordinary ones actually, die. Some didn't even had a chance to get off the boat. It wasn't about who was good or skilled. It was the luck of the draw. Maybe you die today, maybe you don't. That initial wave, in which the germans are practically using the American soldiers as target practice, shows not only the brutality of war but the frailty of man, as evidenced in the many individual reactions of soldiers Spielberg captures. We see them getting blown up,losing limbs and even guts. Suddenly, ""crying for your mama"" is not as childish or cowardly as we thought.We also see the enemy in a whole new light. After the Rangers finally make it up the beach, some of them shoot a group of surrendering germans in a scene we would have never seen in a film before this one. At that moment the germans stop being robots and become human. ""Our guys wouldn't do that!"" would cry some but deep inside we know better. If you just saw most of your friends slaughtered, what would you do if you faced their executioners? This is the type of question this film makes you think again and again about war and what it means. But obviously gore and horror for gut and horror's sake is not what makes this film so important and relevant. In the end, it's the soldiers and the choices they make in all that chaos. Many filmakers in the past might have opted to downright ignore the chaos of war maybe out of respect. To avoid having thee soldiers looking a little less because of the things they did or witnessed but Spielberg chose to show it and the result is quite the contrary. By witnessing the true hell they went through we actually appreciate the choices they made even more. Under all of that, they chose to fight for their country and protect each other. Incredible.I could go on but many, many people have made better reviews than this one. To think I wanted to focus more on the films transfer to BD. Now I'm running long.To put it simply, the transfer is flawless. Spielberg has become notorious for the look of his later films which are defing by a rough, grainy, almost desaturated look. A.I. Minority Report, War of the Worlds, Munich and of course Private Ryan all have similar looks to them. (Not coincidentaly, all of them the handy work of Janus Kaminsky)I was worried that in this manic world of HD and ""grain-haters"", that the director's true intent might have been lost in a sea of noise reduction and edge enhancement. Not so. All those releases and this masterpiece in particular, retain their intended look. What HD has brought to the table is a sea of colors that I was not able to pick neither in theaters (where I saw it three times) or in all subsequent releases on home video. Now I'm, not talking about Pixar-Cars-The Incredibles kind of colors mind you. Its more subtle but very noticable. Now flesh tones look real and defined. The greens and olives (which dominate the film) look amazing and the bright colors that show up so sparingly now pop even more. Textures come alive. A scene where Mellish shares his gum with another soldier, check out the detail in their surrounding s and the barrel of the machine gun. Amazing. And all that, while retaining the original grain structure of the film. Now that is what HD is all about.I cannot recomment this film enough and this Blu-Ray is one of the best transfers of a catalog title of 2010 if not the best so far. While I'm sure many would be dissapointed that the film doesn't look like, say, Avatar on Blu-Ray. I say they are missing the point. This is the way this film was meant to be seen."	5.0	Fawless HD Transfer for a Flawless Film	2010-07-15	4	4	0

They were called to serve their country and many good men and I'm sure women too, lost their lives doing it. War movies aren't my first choice and I hate war. But this one  really comes to life. You feel their courage, you feel their pain, you feel  their sorrow, you feel their losses and I especially, though brave, felt  their fear. Fear of dying, fear for having so many lives depend on you. Did  you make the right choices? I have seen many great war movies, but this one  is special. I have always honored our men who have fought in war for our  freedom and safety. But this show takes you on a journey into what their  lives were really like while they fought for us. Decisions had to be made  under pressure, they weren't always right. Things happen so quickly you do  the best you can. The beginning was shocking to me too and my heart went  out to them. I normally don't even watch R movies. But this one was history  coming to life. This movie wasn't just about Private Ryan, it was about all  the brave men who have ever been in a war. It was history told in a  touching way. I can't say one bad thing about the making of this one. Sure  no one wants to see blood and gore anymore than those who saw it first hand  did. But did you want to see a glamorized movie? Or what really happened. I  loved Tom Hanks performance. I give this movie all thumbs up! I wouldn't  have missed it.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1FD8LITJZE48V	"Frank Ponce ""Movie Mavin"""	Steven Spielberg is a favorite director of mine. His outstanding contribution to cinema include the films SCHINDLER'S LIST, E.T, JAWS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. Then came his brainchild, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a unforgettable film achievement that won five Academy Awards, including best director, but was robbed of the Best Picture award to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. Nevertheless, this film has had a philosophical and lasting influence to the way war films should match.The World-War II era based film is loaded with powerful and graphic war scenes and the film's message is profound. Honor, dignity, and courage is spread throughout the film.Outstanding actor Tom Hanks portrays Captain John Miller who leads his troops through the historic D-day invasion during WWII. He and his deticated men then embark on a dangerous mission to track down Private James Ryan, whose three brothers died on enemy line, and bring him home.The production values are amazing. The cinematography is well-done, it sort of has a documentary feel to it. The sound is the best I've heard in a film ever! It sounds great on the DVD! The D-Day intro is absolutely breathtaking.Spielberg made his usual masteriso work into making this the most realistic vision of any war film. It could have been the best, if the film would have a better story. But I mean that in the nicest way!Recommended all the way!	5.0	A Magnificent war film!	2004-02-19	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2R2A84C2IZB9U	Fred Glow	Saving Private Ryan clearly ranks as one of the best motion pictures of all time. Unfortunately, the small screen version of the picture does not  do the battle scenes justice. Anyone interested in buying this movie should  consider the wide screen VHS version.Aside from that lone defect, I  would recommend this video to everyone. I have seen this film in the  theater four times and although being 6' 5&quot; tall and weighing 225 lbs,  I still have tears in my eyes every time I watch it.For me, watching the  movie brings me a sense of profound humility. The first time I saw the film  was a couple of days after being laid off from my job. I realized then that  my troubles paled in comparison to those brave men who gave their lives on  Omaha Beach. Since that time, I have become ever more interested in the  happenings before and during World War II and hopefully have more humility  and concern for others.If our young people who were not born during this  time of world conflict watched this film, they might derive the same sense  of humility and appreciation as I have of the men and women of our armed  forces who basically saved the world from tyranny.Now about the movie:  Tom Hanks was perfect in his role as were all of the supporting actors. In  particular, Sizemore was the perfect sergeant. I knew many of his type when  I served in the military. Goldberg, the lone Jew, was terrific in his part  as was Diesel as Caparzo. My favorite in the film was Burns who portrayed  Private Reiben from Brooklyn. This young man played his role flawlessly.The opening battle scene was horrifying. I kept telling myself there was  no way anyone would come out alive. The tank scene at the end was more  terrifying than any horror movie. I can still hear the creaking and  clanking of the tank wheels even without watching the film. What at first  seemed an implausable story was made entirely plausable by the way it was  carried out.It is very unfortunate Saving Private Ryan did not win an  Academy Award for best picture, which it richly deserved and ended up  behind Shakespeare in Love, which I walked out on when it was halfway  through.	5.0	One of the best motion pictures of all time	2000-08-06	4	3	1

And after three hours it certainly is.  Yes it sends messages, but so did Platoon, Hamburger Hill  and Casualties of War.  Tom Hanks does his usual superb acting job; this  time he's Captain of a young and energetic platoon with more guts than  glory as we watch one after another suffer unspeakable mutilation on the  battlefield.  Matt Damon is Private Ryan, but displays none of the screen  charm and eye catching talent of his Good Will Hunting role.  The messages  are clear that war is brutal and senseless and inhuman and horrid, but  after seeing the film three times I'm thinking that Saving Private Ryan is  more about showcasing spectacular special effects (Normandy Beach scenes)  than about anything else.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1XK32B1GRLEO6	"Fun Blue Eyes ""There's no cryin!"""	"It's hard to say things about a movie that has generated (as of this review) more than 1200 reviews.The 60th Anniversary Edition is presented in a very sturdy ""bullet"" case.  Opening up gives you two discs with a very good background design with scraps and memorabilia of the Operation Overlord (The Normandy invasion).  The 2nd disc is primarily the extras...a chance to see all the research and diligent work put into making the film as authentic as possible.  The storyline, finding the 4th Ryan brother, is very similar to an actual (read: real) problem the military had back then.  From then on, the US military had prohibited relatives from serving in the same unit, or being assigned to the same hostile area.The idea of sending one unit to find Pvt Ryan (a member of the infamous 101st ""missed drop"" unit), can and, in the inspiration for the movie, did happen.Because of this movie...Gamers have ""Medal of Honor"", ""Call of Duty"", and ""Brothers in Arms"", and HBO and History Channel has/had ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Mail Call"".World War II may seem like way too long ago for anyone to really watch this movie and wonder ""Why does it matter?"".  But, as everyone has noticed, the vets that served alongside Ryan, Miller, and Upham are dying in great numbers.  We need to know how they survived not only the Depression, but the Baby Boom as well, and made this country the powerhouse it is in terms of economy and wealth.Thank God TNT is showing SPR unedited in November...and I am sure also in May."	5.0	Realistic, brutal, and absolutely REQUIRED viewing.	2006-01-16	2	1	1

It was about time.Second, the acting,  dialogue, and story was perfect.A lot of people bash this movie because  the plot was 'too simple&quot;, or it was &quot;regular war movie  garbage.&quot; Well, I got news for all of you: War is anything but  spectactular or outstanding.Whether you're taking a machine gun nest, or  planning a multi-national assault on a beachhead, you want and need to keep  things as simple as possible; hence, the &quot;simple plot.&quot;As far  as the &quot;regular war movie garbage&quot; goes, the makers of this movie  were simply taking events that actually happened and told a story loosely  based around them. So, next time you see a WWII vet, why don't you go up to  him/her and tell them their war wasn't realistic and all they did amounted  to &quot;garbage&quot;.That is, if you got the guts to...People  learned from this movie that warfare is basically the simplest, most brutal  act that humanity can wage against itself: Kill or be killed.Since the  beginning of the film era, the world's been waiting for a realistic war  film.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2BWK5H1YNLCWS	Gabe Reardon	I am a child of the 70's, grew up in the 80's, and matured in the 90's (supposedly).  I'll admit that there are surely some war flick gems I have never laid eyes on.  To be honest, almost all of the war movies I have seen  were made after the time of my birth ('72).  I have seen Apocolypse Now,  Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Born on the 4th of July, Hamburger Hill, The  Thin Red Line, etc, etc.  Each of those I found to be good, if not great  movies.  But for my dollar, Saving Private Ryan captures the most of what I  think a war flick should.  The story itself is not overly complex:  the  mission to save one man.  Of course, there is much more to it than that,  but that is the basics.  I have to admit that the two battle scenes at the  beginning and at the end are what set this movie apart from the others.  Normally I am into the more poignant and artistic war films (Born on the  4th, The Thin Red Line), but my values have changed.  Simply put, no other  war movie has left me with a feeling of loss and pain.  The time Spielberg  and crew spent on making the battle scenes look and feel as realistic as  possible is not to be overlooked.  The camerawork was perfect.  The way the  marines worked the way up too the beach on the shaky camerawork was  brilliant.  The muted coloration helped inspire the gloom and terror of  these battle scenes.  Yes, I'll admit the characters weren't developed as  much as they could have been, and yes, this was a United States flagwaving,  patriotic movie to the core.  But I don't see how people from all over the  world can't find this movie absolutely moving.  And I would love to see a  movie made about WWII as told by another contributing army.  But until that  day comes, people should stop complaining about how flipping typically  American this is and enjoy it for what it is.  If you don't leave this  movie without feeling a profound statement was made for not just the U.S.  but the world then maybe you might need to be a bit more open-minded.	5.0	A WWII film for the ages	2000-06-29	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I	"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan"""	As the ocean tide is red with blood, it is hard to forget the memorable scenes in just the first thirty minutes of this film. It could have ended there and still have been the masterpiece this film is. It teaches how horrible war is, but it also shows what freedom is paid with. Tom Hanks and everyone else in this movie have really made something special. Like I said, this movie has moments and scenes that are so real, you never forget it.The special effects for this movie are sadly incredible. I say sadly because of how realistically these soldiers die. From heads being blown off to missing limbs, the special effects team did an amazing job in this movie. The music in the movie is unbelievable. From battle scenes to families getting notice that their sons are dead, it captures the moments well. Overall, this is a movie that everyone should see. It will always be a reminder that war is hell, but the freedom the soldiers of WW2 gave us through their victory was worth it.	5.0	A New Appreciation For Our Soldiers	2006-10-20	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AVG8LM0ELD4IV	Garrick Bergh	Steven Spielberg is a proven master of movie making - providing he does not stray from the path of producing movies with a capital E for  entertainment. When he wanders into the field of history he does not seem  to be able to resist taking Indiana Jones with him.In Schindlers' List -  where I feel he came closest to making an historical classic - he  absolutely destroyed the finish by trotting out the survivors in full sun  drenched colour having shot the balance of the movie in a cleverly washed  out hue.In Saving Private Ryan he starts off promisingly. The landing is  handled with a gritty intensity and it was refreshing to see ( if you can  call murder refreshing ) that GI's too are not above shooting surrendering  troops. All very credible in the heat of battle.Given that the director  was always going to introduce the 'human element' to pander to the soapie  fans I also felt that the uncovering of the Ryan casualties was also  tastefully done. As was the scene depicting the breaking of the news to  their mother.My major beef was with the last half hour where Spielberg  reverts right back to the B grade matinee. Tom Hanks - AKA John Wayne -  fights off the evil empire. I kept on waiting for Donald Sutherland and  Telly Savalas to appear! Or at the very least a peppering of Sieg Heils! or  Banzais!Reality check - The D-Day landings were notable for the sluggish  initial response the Allies encountered from the Germans. So the landing,  per se, was not as difficult as it might have been. It was the thereafter,  despite complete air superiority and limitless resources, that heavy  weather was made.Hanks and his cronies - if we are to accept the  Spielberg version - lured in all likelihood one of two SS divisions to  their party. Either Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler or Hitlerjugend.Assuming  it was the Leibstandarte - which had been resting and refitting in France  following their exertions on the Eastern front - then I have a huge problem  with their performance in this movie. These were canny operators of the  highest order and, with the greatest respect to Hanks and his band, would  have 'eaten them for breakfast' given their combat experience.Strangely  - despite other reviewers' comments to the contrary - the sudden ( and  timely ) intervention of air cover at the end of the action - was the most  factually plausible aspect of the sequence.If the director wishes to  continue presenting cartoon style history to modern viewers who -  particularly since 1989 and the demise of Soviet Russia are gaining access  to more and more archival material - then I must suggest he changes his  name to Schmaltzberg.	2.0	Great Production - Cornball Story	2000-08-22	20	12	8
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AST6J8O85X3F5	Garry E. Lewis	Stephen Spielberg has done it again!When I watched this movie I was at once shocked by the horror these troops met on that beach head. So many being slaughtered inside the landing crafts before they could even reach shore. The sounds of rounds striking all around them, The ocean literally turned into blood from all these fallen heros. Once you get past the initial shock of the horror these brave men faced on that beachhead, then comes the mission. Tom Hanks character Captain John MIller is assigned to find a Private Ryan, and get him back home. Ryan unaware that he has lost three brothers to the war is found by Tom Hanks Character and his patrol. The mission has cost them dearly and now their faced with an oncoming German attack before they can safely escort Private Ryan who is played by Matt Damien safely back from behind enemy lines. A very touching movie, you feel Tom Hanks characters pain as he watches his men give their lives to save Private Ryans,to get him back home to safty. Back home to a mother who has sacrificed so much for the war. Having only one son left out of four. Heartwarming, a very emotional movie. Great acting on Tom Hanks and Matt Damiens part indeed. You won't be disappointed, but you will be touched, and changed by this movie.Saving Private Ryan (Sapphire Series)  [Blu-ray]Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)	5.0	Saving Private Ryan	2010-11-25	4	2	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AAM7A1TY3JBC5	Gary Boggiano	The beach front scene is riveting and very realistic.  It speaks well of the horror these brave men faced so many years ago.This concept of saving Private Ryan, a paratrooper who has lost his three brothers almost  in an instant is a great motive for telling this type of story.Remember  however, Private Ryan is a paratrooper who lands sveral miles behind enemy  lines; no day in the park.  However, he never was at nor experienced the  landing on Normandy Beach.  Therefore I ask, how can Private Ryan as a  veteran visiting the Normandy grave sites have a flash back so compelling  and realistic of that battle?  He was never there.  This is a major story  line flaw I am sorry to say.	3.0	Good Action, Nice Concept, Major Story Line Flaw	2000-02-02	12	7	5

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ATJPZUN4FX9	Gary Lloyd	"I caught a part of this movie and pretty much didn't like what I saw.In screenwriting there's a flaw called ""On the nose"" dialog.  interesting dialogue is often oblique. Someone says, ""How are you?"" and the other guy answers, ""Say, you got a extra smoke?""  If the other guy says, ""Fine, how are you?"" that's on the nose dialog. The movie, of course, didn't have any of this, but it had dialog distantly related to ""On the nose"" dialog, often delivered by Tom Hanks. Mind you, in all other respects the dialog was brilliant ... but that's just it -- too damn brilliant ... on the nose brilliance. Hanks was too damn brilliant. He was superman, Oscar Wilde, James Bond and Tom Hanks rolled in room. Renaissance man. All-knowing ... Godly. It was like he knew throughout the movie he was going to win the Oscar already.Mind you, lots of what he did was pure genius. Like all great actors, Hanks has a way of zeroing in on the absolutely correct tone and inflection. His voice dips and rises exactly where it should. Lines that are supposed to sound like off-handed after thoughts sound like off-handed after-thoughts, and that takes tremendous skill.But still his character was a cardboard one -- a brilliantly drawn cardboard one, but a cardboard one nonetheless.Also, in the brief part of the movie I saw, I witnessed an unevenness that made me shake my head in disappointment. It's the great scene of the Intelligence corporal told to get his gear because he was joining Hanks combat patrol. Well-done and comical. The kid is frightened to death. He tries to explain to Hanks that he's not trained for that kind of work, that he hasn't fired a rifle since basic training. Great! Engaging subplot and I looked forward for it being developed, but a few minutes later while on patrol he's relaxed and joking. What the faa? Why wasn't the fish out of water theme better developed?Finally, the focus on Tom Hanks was a bad idea too. Combat movie is about teamwork. The movie is titled Private Ryan, but it really should have been called ""A movie made to get Tom Hanks his long-overdue Oscar.""Also, as an ex-enlisted man, I didn't like the way an officer was portrayed as King and everyone else as his subjects. Captains generally didn't go out on patrol and when they did they weren't as combat savvy as the guys who did it every day. Yet Captain Tom Hanks was like a bigger version of Tom Cruise -- the best always in every situation all the time, a Dr. Phil in combat gear.I like combat movies but have no desire to see this movie in its entirety.  Right off, I could tell it didn't have the inspired genius of Apocalypse Now! or some of the other greats."	2.0	Uneven, Problematic	2011-06-11	32	3	29
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1G9FX1KV45N41	Gary Selikow	Possibly the best war movie of the 1990s, this film with it's gritty realism, the gruesome reality with which the soldiers are fatally wounded is indeed not for the faint hearted but is an advancement from movies where sliders and shot and fall down dead with a neat wound. War is a gruesome thing indeed, War is hell William Tecumseh Sherman but sometimes less of an evil than allowing tyranny and unopposed terror to flourish and take over the world -more of that laterBegins with the Battle of Omaha in all of its horror and raw courage of the American soldiers making the D Day landing.Followed by some rivet ting triumphs as the evil Nazi war machine starts to crumble and the Nazis-so good at butchering - soon reveal themselves as the cowards they were.In Washington, D.C, General George Marshall, (after having received news that the four brothers of the Ryan family have been killed in action and their mother will receive three telegrams to inform her of this) finds out that the last of the bothers Private James Ryans is missing in action and orders that a force is sent to find him and bring him home.Captain John H Miller (Tom Hanks) receives an order to head the task force he assembles to rescue Ryan and they penetrate German lines , losing tow of the men in the process , and showing great valour. Their are many questions they as, many questions the movie poses-Throughout the men question why 8 men risk death to rescue one man.- and is somewhat u;ultimately answered at the end. Throughout the men question why 8 men risk death to rescue one man.The movie ends with Private Ryan being found and though distressed by the news of his brothers deaths refuses to desert his companions, and so together Miller and his task force battle with Ryan;s battalion to secure a vital bridge against the Germans in epic battle scene.Much action,. so action aficionados will not be disappointed but this movie also has humour, philosophy, drama,and pathosthe ending is a real tearjerker. The movie go's some way to explaining why free nations must fight to retain the good  in the world being overwhelmed by the  the forces of evil , tyranny and terror. 70 years ago it was Nazism that treated to plunge the world into darkness and destroy all goodness, today it is Islamism . Today against America and Britain , joined by the descendants of Hitler's foremost victims, must join together again and fight the new scourge against humanity-Islamist terror and tyranny.May the free world show the same steadfastness they showed against Hitler and won	5.0	An epic war movie in every way	2014-05-13	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A31O7B59DW7OHR	Gene Bromberg	The opening 20 minutes or so of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; are among the greatest ever put on film Ask anyone who's seen the movie about the  assault on Omaha Beach and you usually get a response in a hushed voice  filled with awe. I think that people always thought that the fighting in  World War II was less violent than it was in, say, Vietnam, because of the  way combat in those two wars were portrayed in the movies. Compare the  &quot;bang, you're dead&quot; fighting in classic WWII movies with the  special effects in movies like &quot;Platoon&quot;.This movie utterly  destroys that perception in the first few seconds of the assault on Omaha.  That sequence, as the landing crafts holding Capt. Miller's (Tom Hanks)  company unloads, is in my opinion the most horrifying scene in movie  history. Horrifying for its graphic violence, for its claustrophobic  terror, and for the fact that men actually died this way. It is almost  unbearable.That some of the men get off the boats and on the beach is a  miracle, and that any survived long enough to engage the enemy is another.  The combat scenes are frantic, exhilarating, of course terrifying. When  Miller and his men finally pull out their weapons you can see the insane  pleasure of combat that soldiers often experience, a chance to hit back and  kill those who are trying to kill them. The combat scenes are  unforgettable, men running through rubble for better firing position,  blasting away with their rifles as fast as they can pull the triggers,  sandbags exploding under the impact of the bullets. No quarter is asked or  given, Americans slaughtering Germans as ruthlessly as the Germans did  before the tide of battle turned.The movie settles down somewhat after  that into a more recognizable war-movie plot. Miller's squad is sent to  find a soldier trapped behind enemy lines who has a ticket home because his  three brothers have all been killed in combat. The movie presents the  question, is the life of one man worth risking the lives of 8 other men?.  The decision to rescue Pvt. Ryan is, however, not a moral one, but a  political one, made by General George Marshall back in Washington, who  doesn't want the papers to print the morale-sapping story of a woman who  lost all 4 of her sons to the war. He makes this choice perhaps in part to  mitigate the suffering of a grieving mother, but more so for the war effort  as a whole. The fact that other mothers may lose sons because of his  decision is, sadly, irrelevant compared to the war effort as a whole.As  Hanks' squad marches through Normandy looking for Ryan you get some feel  for the enormous scope of the invasion, and the confusion of it all.  Thousands of men, all heavily armed, a terrible sight.  Every encounter  with the Germans turns to chaos. A sniper forces the squad to watch  impotently as one of their friends dies just beyond their reach. A falling  pole collapses a wall, revealing a room full of armed and very surprised  Germans, and the resulting standoff, with Americans and Germans pointing  guns at each other and screaming for the other to surrender, is almost  absurdly funny, until the standoff ends with an inevitable massacre.The  battle at the end of the movie is as terrible as the assault on Omaha. The  fighting is savage and cruel, and the violence is so graphic that it is  difficult to watch. You almost get the feeling during the fighting that the  world is coming to an end, that the gods are coming down to destroy the  world. When the battle finally ends, with the squad's sole survivor walking  around in circles, seemingly looking for his lost comrades, there is an  overwhelming sense of loss. Not triumph, or relief, or anger, just  loss.Spielberg and Kaminski do brilliant work here. The world of the  battlefield is shown  with terrible verisimilitude. Hopefully future war  movies will not feel the need to be as graphic in depicting combat as this  film is, but in this movie its absolutely necessary. The colors in the  movie have a faded, washed out appearance, and the camera runs along right  next to the soldiers, adding to the powerfully realistic feel.The only  problems I had with the movie is the way it's framed. You see an older man  in the present day visiting a military cemetery in France. The man kneels  before a grave, and as he begins to remember the events that make up the  film, the scene switches from the old man to Miller in the landing craft.  You get the impression that Miller is the old man, which he's not. I  thought that was confusing and not well-done.And at the end, when you  know who the old man is, and his family is standing behind him, a family  that wouldn't exist if not for Miller and his men. The man breaks down and  asks his wife, &quot;Tell me I'm a good man.&quot; This is pure Hollywood,  all wrong. After all that's come before there is no need to resort to such  blatant tear-jerking appeals to the audience. It would have been far better  for the old man to quietly ask that question of himself, or, better yet, to  say nothing at all, and let the scene stand by itself. What words can  convey the thanks and gratitude for the sacrifices made?	5.0	One of the greatest movies of all time	2000-09-02	10	7	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A241GUHBQR439N	Genetics Grad Student	I have read quite a bit of reviews that said the effects were great, but the story lacked focus, the character development sucked, etc.  Having just gotten out of Army (I served in a real combat unit--3d Ranger Batallion)I  can appreciate the movie more than most (except the D-Day vets themselves).  Almost everyone is completely missing the point of this movie.  Yes, the  first 30 minutes are just terrific/horrendous, but it IS the characters and  the storyline that make this movie so good.  The violence and death is the  easy part of it.  It's the friends, the bonds, the experiences, the  dilemmas, the camraderie, the Mission, that make war so memorable.  Any war  movie can show violence--so what.  This movie made me cry not because of  the people being shot and maimed, but because of the real soldier story  behind.  Unless you have been shot at, it's hard to explain and understand.  Remarkable that Spielberg (a non-vet) did it so well.	5.0	Realistic as it gets	1999-11-05	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A10LFOZBTOXN7B	G. Huntsman	I am absolutely sick of all the Euro trash who watch these war films and automatically spit up all over themselves with loads of mindless anti-American crap. Saving Private Ryan isn't mindlessly patriotic just because it has an American flag waving in the breeze - it's just a film that actually SHOWS what happened to these young men during World War 2. And what's this about how American soldiers were no better than the Nazis, and they were all they did were rape women and pillage European towns? Watch the documentary of the Easy Company veterans on the Band of Brothers DVD, see the veterans breaking down, recalling memories of their best friends getting blown to bits. Americans did not intentionally bomb Dresden; it was a mistake made by the crew of the plane marking targets for the incoming bombers. The many thousands of people killed by Nazi bombers destroying London, however, was intentional.My own grandfather participated the the taking of Omaha Beach on D-Day, and I don't think I've ever been more angered by what Jargo has to say about an entire generation of fighting men that lost their best friends over in Europe. Just because segregation and racism existed during that time DOES NOT MEAN that the soldiers were any more despicable because of it. Besides, there aren't too many American veterans living in Finland, so what does he know about it?To me, Saving Private Ryan is the best movie I've ever seen. Sure, there's a couple production errors here and there, but the excellent acting, gritty realism, spectacular musical score and intense action hold your interest throughout. It's all the more amazing that Spielberg did this entire film without any storyboards whatsoever. Overall, it's a spectucular film that deserves to be remembered, and it's a damn shame it didn't get the Oscar for Best Picture.	5.0	SPR	2004-12-04	11	6	5

It opened a lot of discussion about what it was ""Really like"".He told us which position was most like his, etc and all of that. One thing that sticks with me is how he said the most ""real"" part of the movie was when they were sitting around talking about home. Talking about girls, family, their ""old life"". He said it depicted the variety of people well, but how they all came together somehow and all had so much in common deep down. Tom Hanks and Spielberg went on to make Band of Brothers, a mini-series based on the book of the same name. I'd recommend that as well.It WAS based off real events and you get commentary from the people the movie is based off of. It's priceless. For those who were looking for more of a documentary, it would be perfect for you.""Saving Private Ryan"" is less about the specific battles and events and more about the overall effect of the war on people. I know our war veteran spoke of those who died as the true heroes, not him. He never understood how he deserved to live when so many other wonderful men died.

It's not going to be about fluffy bunnies and rainbows, if you know what I mean. Don't get me wrong though, it's pretty gory. A lot of close ups of people blowing up and losing limbs, but it's mainly in the Omaha Beach attack in the beginning. It doesn't really get any worse.In the movie, four brothers went into WWII, three were K.I.A., and the fourth was still on the battlefront. A troop of eight(?) men were sent to save him, hence the title Saving Private Ryan.

Many of the incidents associated with the landing are lifted from Steven Ambrose's excellent book, D Day, since he was a technical advisor to Speilberg. However, to a military man what gives the landing scene amazing verisimilitude is the professionalism of the company commander and his first sergeant, each in separate landing craft. Hanks, who plays the Ranger company commander, is shaking from accumulated combat stress to the point that he is barely able to drink from a canteen. Yet he maintains his composure, cares for his men, and most importantly focuses on accomplishment of his mission despite a landing degenerated into chaos.Next to a parachute drop the most confusing entry into a battlefield is across a hostile beach. No where is this better portrayed than in Saving Private Ryan. Throughout the film the character, courage and depth of American fighting men is exemplified and respected.The plot is taken from fact. A soldier in the 101st Airborne lost a brother in the China-Burma-India Theater, another on Utah Beach and a third with the 82nd. In reality a message was sent to the commander of the 101st, General Max Taylor, and the soldier was evacuated across the beach. In Saving Private Ryan, the story becomes a metaphor for the war itself. In what seems a confusing statement Hank's sergeant says 'This could be the best thing we've ever done.' The viewer is uncertain if he is referring to the last, frantic battle to defend a bridge - a critical invasion choke point - or saving Ryan. Or both. That is just one of several mysterious facets that keeps you coming back to the film. What does he really mean here? It is much more than simply an adventure story though as such it can hardly be equalled.Speilberg has said that he intended this to be an anti-war film. That is also confusing in that his Jewish prisoners were rescued by an Allied advance in Shindler's List and would have died without victory in the war. Perhaps he is caught up in some PC. Nonetheless, these are nits and do not detract from the overall impact of the film.You will want to see this again, so you need to own it.	5.0	Battlefield Metaphor	2004-04-17	9	8	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2230OS9W655QF	Grant Waara	What else can be said of this movie that the previous 1,000 reviews have already said?I won't go into plot and all, I'm sure everyone knows the storyline. I'm here as a lifelong student of World War II to say that yes, there are flaws in this movie, both historical and technical, but over all, this movie is probably the greatest film of World War II combat ever made.Some people complain about the &quot;Tigers&quot; being converted Russian T-34s (very much true) but when was the last time that SOMEONE tried to make a tank LOOK like a German tank? In &quot;Patton&quot; (a great movie too) you had American M-48s slapped with gray paint and German crosses to represent German Armor. In SPR, there are two Marders, some Schutzenpanzerwagen halftracks, accurate gear and uniforms. Name me any movies prior to SPR where there was as much authentic gear. I doubt you'll find any...Some quibble that no Tigers met GIs this early in the Normandy campaign. This is true too. There WERE Tigers in Normandy on June 13 (the date of the SPR's fictional Battle of Ramelle) and they were tearing up a brigade of the famed British 7th Armored Division (the Desert Rats) at Villers Bocage, but again, I think some people are missing SPR's point.Where SPR succeeds brilliantly is that it went for what I call a &quot;higher truth.&quot; In this case, the truth is the hell of a modern war zone. War, no matter where or when it is fought, is a hellish place utterly foreign to the human imagination where time has its own distinctive meaning and your world goes no farther than the men in your squad or platoon.Spielberg has managed the impossible. He actually caught the seething hell of combat. I think people will watch this film for decades and many will walk away feeling that they have seen war for the first time and will feel respect for those who have endured its fires.SPR was gypped of the best picture Oscar. It should have won instead of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (which it was far superior to) but since actors love movies about actors, it lost. A shame. Next to &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is one of Spielberg's greatest achievments. Let's hope he does a film about Iwo Jima.	5.0	A Combat Masterpiece	2003-03-12	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AFSAD45180WP4	"Greenbloody ""greenbloody"""	Received my DVD copy last night. My scoop of the day: a) sound effects were above average  (they got an Oscar for it);sounds are precisely located so they match the visual effects in terms of location of event and  distance; b) low-freq sound effects are quite exceptional; particularly,  the far-away rumbles;  c) picture quality is much better than the VHS  (that's expected) d) trailers are the worst ones that I've ever seen.  Unlike other trailers, which tend to over-represent the movie, this one  actually under-represented the movie.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2XC723XT2PD2W	Greg	This movie is awesome. The second scence opens up with Omaha Beach where the speical effects are awesome yet terrifying: a man picking up his arm that blew off, a man sitting with his guts hanging out crying for his mother, a mans face being taken off. After this Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a group of his company are sent to go find Private Ryan to send him home since all his brothers are dead. Would this happen, I doubt a group of men would be sent to find somebody before their units close to the person, but who knows.The group of men go through the hedgerows, and of course encounter Germans. The scence with the prisoner is amazing. When they find Private Ryan there is an awesome, but yet again terrifying fight.The acting in this is great, and the guest stars in it were awesome, one is Ted Dawnson from Cheers.

Spielberg really went all out and served up the benchmark of war movies. His dedication to the project and respect to the WWII. veterans is honorable.This DVD special addition has a ton of behind the scenes footages, interviews with actors and very important non acting players.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2UYAFQ40U2PHS	"Grigory's Girl ""GR"""	I never really liked this film when it was released.  Years later, I realised that it was just a film that garnered all the hype in the world to disguise the fact that it's really a shallow movie.  Essentially, the movie has 2 incredibly violent, gory battles scenes, and the stuff in between is absolute garbage.  The main characters in this film seem liked they were pulled from every WWII movie that Robert Rodat (the screenwriter) and Steven Spielberg saw when they were a child.  You never get a sense that these people are real people, just characters in a Hollywood version of WWII.  The actors scream and shout like they're in a video game, not a war.  The sniper character is especially creepy, saying God shines through his rifle and a lot of other garbage that wouldn't be too out of place in The Crusades.  Are we supposed to like him?  We don't.  I just recently saw Flags of Our Fathers, which centered on the famous picture of Iwo Jima.  It too had realistic, gory battle scenes, but they fit into the film as a whole.  That film had depth and had a message about war, the human condition, and propaganda.  This film has no real soul to it.  The battle scenes just seem to like to show how gory war is (which it is, obviously), but that's the only point.  There is nothing else in the film that matters.  The whole thing is hollow to the core.  Having also seen Darryl F. Zanuck's production The Longest Day, this film fails in comparison.  Zanuck had served in WWII, and his film is vastly superior.  The Longest Day covered the Normandy invasion in brilliant fashion, covering it with the most meticulous detail.  It also made a point that there were British, Scottish, and Irish troops on the shores of Normandy too (something Private Ryan forgot to mention), and that the French Resistance played a huge role in disrupting German communications before the invasion (another oversight).  The graphic violence doesn't even give one a sense of war.  It seems they land on the beach, a lot of people get killed in gruesome ways, then they're on top of the beach making jokes about the whole thing.  Flags of Our Fathers and The Longest Day really give you a sense of what the planning was, and why they were there.  This film doesn't.  There's actually some very awkward comic relief in the film, too.  Spielberg has made a great WWII film, but it isn't this one.  It's Empire of the Sun, based on JG Ballard's book.  That film is one of Spielberg's greatest, and most underrated, films.  See that one, The Longest Day, or Malick's The Thin Red Line.  They are all vastly superior films to Private Ryan.	2.0	One of the most overrated films ever....	2006-11-03	32	11	21
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A33JPVYZOTTB8Q	Growly Pants	"This is simply the greatest war film ever made. Ever. And I've seen a TON of war films. Im hoping Speilberg makes a similar movie about the Marines in the pacific (Thin Red Line just wasnt that good). Using a new style of filming, the crew ran alongside the actors in every scene, giving the viewer the sense of actually being there with the troops (if that feeling is EVER possible through film). This film is simply brilliant. And powerful. Also fantastic is the audio. The sounds of bullets whizzing by overhead and ""pinging"" off metal had me actually ducking in the movie theater. Apparently, it was too real for many veterans who subsequently had to leave the theater.'Saving Private Ryan"" starts in the American cemetery in Normany where some thousands upon thousands upon thousands of American soldiers are buried in endless rows of beautiful white stone crosses. The scenery is simply beautiful, with the English Channel in the backround. Then the horror starts. It's June 6, 1944. Early morning. The soldiers of Tom Hank's Ranger batallion are headed for Omaha beach in a crammed Higgins boat. They're terrified, they're sick and they're cold. Many have never seen combat before. The Germans are dropping shells all around their boat. You feel like you're there with these boys. Your hands are sweaty, you're nervous. Your nauseous. You know what they're in for. So do they, and thats what makes this scene so utterly horriying. They know when that ramp drops to unload them on the beach they're probably gonna die. Are you insane by this point??? Are you resigned to the fact that you're gonna die?? Or are you so utterly terrified that you're numb???? Speilberg captures all this. He's a brilliant director.Then the boys hit shore and the ramp drops. The first 5 soldiers are immediately shot in the head and drop. The rest clamor out of the boat, terrified. Literally running for their lives. They climb over the sides, they jump out the front and into the waist high water. Some are shot to peices. Some drown under the weight of their packs. You feel all of this. You're there!!!!! The German artillery and machine gun fire is unrelenting. It's like a wave of lead showering these poor souls from every and all angles. Again, Speilberg is a genius.Some of the boys make it to the beach.....then the real horror begins. Much has been said about the first 20 minutes of this movie.....too gruesome, too violent. Sickeneing. How can a movie that depicts what living Americans (or any human for that matter) experienced be described as ""too"" anything???? That's where I part ways with the critics. This is what they lived through. This is part of many peoples experince. This was their life. To think that there are many older people walking around today who actually LIVED THROUGH experiences like this is almost too much to think about. Do they think about it all day everyday for the rest of their lives??? Do they dream about it every night?? Do they have flashbacks that result from certain sounds or smells??? Do they relive it?? Are you insane on the inside but appear ""ok"" to the everyday passerby?? Maybe even to your family??This movie is simply wonderful. The whole movie. Tom Hanks gave this character his all. Mostly because he respected the character and knew that he was representing an entire generation of human beings for whom this experience of war was real. If you havent seen this movie, buy it now. Watch it in surround sound.......go to war. You'll come away with a whole new respect for those old men you see who 60 years later are still wearing hats with the insignia of their company or batallion on it. And you'll understand why."	5.0	COMBAT PERFECTION. BEAUTIFUL FILM.	2005-03-17	16	13	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ALN771O7A4HJG	G Smith	"First, I agree with all that see this film as a technical masterpiece.  The battle scenes, sound, hand-held camera work, and other special effects are incomparable.Many of the historical facts are astoundingly  accurate as well.  If you review the battle plan for Omaha you will see  that the 2nd Ranger Battalion hit the beach at Dog Green Sector in the  first wave and that they were ""right where they were supposed to be but  no-one else was"" (all the other first wave groups landed at the wrong  place).  You will also see that the DD tanks at Omaha were supposed to land  first but they all ""foundered in the channel"".  It was also necessary for  the engineers to blow the obstacles fast because the tide rises at one inch  per minute in Normandy.  Bangalore torpedoes WERE used to blow the wire  behind the seawall.  Dog-1 Exit IS right near Vierville. The details are  almost all perfect.The character development I would call sparse.  I  have the film on DVD and having seen certain scenes many times so now I  feel the character development is superb - but of course if you have to see  it over and over then that is a problem!I do think that the impact of  the film goes far beyond just the ""tactical"" elements of the plot and  characters.  As I watch it, I do feel a sense of awe and wonder that these  men would do what they did on D-day (and all the battles of the war).  While our British friends will no doubt be offended by this, there is  something unique about the young Americans we see in the opening scene in  the Higgins boats - men who have come from 5,000+ miles away to save people  they do not even know from an evil that is far from their homes. The film  presents this uniquely American mystery to us - not only in the opening  scene, but in my opinion, throughout the entire 2.5 hours.I must comment  on the &quot;absurdity&quot; of the plot.  There were four brothers in WW2  that closely approximate the Ryan brothers' fictional scenario.  The real  life Niland brothers were all in the army - 2 died at Normandy, one died in  Asia and one was in the airborne and was dropped behind lines on D-Day.  The War Department pulled the fourth brother out when they learned this  (this is an historical fact).I must also make a positive comment about  John Williams' score, especially the final ""Hymn for the Fallen"".  When I  hear the voices of the Tanglewood Chorus rising over the final credits I  think back to the doomed men of the Higgins boats about to be splattered by  bullets and I get the feeling that this overwhelming choral sound is the  sound of their souls rising up off of that beach like a shock wave to drive  back the evil that had taken root in Europe.  This is a fine piece of music  that does honor to these men.  Yet even these ""perfect"" men were shown to  not be so perfect in the scenes of surrendering Germans being gunned down  by angry American troops.I also can't omit the great and oft-overlooked  performance of Tom Sizemore as Sargeant Mike Horvath.  He merges into the  background as a 'leader of grunts'.  &quot;We're in business! &quot;I  can't close without making one major criticism of this film.  I feel the  film is badly marred by the maudlin final scene.Its still an outstanding  film and one that haunts me to this day.  I have the soundtrack CD and its  great.  I also highly recommend Steven Ambrose's &quot;D-day&quot; book and  General Omar Bradley's book &quot;A Soldier's Story&quot; if you really  want to understand the details behind D-Day."	5.0	Some oft-missed criticisms (and praise)	2000-03-04	20	18	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AKT0Y6J9AK469	"GumbyTheCat ""Gumby"""	"I already have this on DVD, but wanted to add to my small collection of films that I think are worthy of Blu-ray. I got this and am glad I did. The difference between the DVD and Blu-ray versions is remarkable. The transfer quality is excellent, with just enough grain to give it an 'historical' feel. Colors are much brighter and crisper on this Sapphire Series Blu-ray than on regular DVD, and the audio is outstanding. You're really missing a lot if you don't run the audio through a home theater system.The movie itself is an incredibly compelling visual and storytelling masterpiece by Steven Spielberg, one of the great war movies of all time. I'm not a big war movie buff, but this one is special. The first half hour, which is an incredibly gut-wrenching portrayal of the invasion of Omaha Beach, is some of the most harrowing and realistic war re-creation footage ever filmed. The first time I saw this movie, the Omaha Beach sequence left me stunned and in tears.There's hundreds of reviews here that describe the movie's plot at length so I won't add to what is already there. Suffice it to say that after the thunderous opening sequence, the movie continues to shine.There are twelve special features included in this two-disc set, ranging from a ""making of"" feature to a couple of simple trailers. Total running time of the extras is about three and one-half hours, and it's all worth watching, especially the feature-length historical documentary on WWII war filming.This Sapphire Series edition of Saving Private Ryan is the best edition of the movie that I know of, and it's currently at a great price.

When will he finally have a bad performance in a film?  While I loved Hanks in this one, the marvelous supporting cast actually stole the show: the sharpshooter who prays before each shot; the wimpy writer; the tough, noble right-hand man sarg, and the baby-faced, foolish-tough, courageous Ryan himself.  And that opening scene!  I watched this one for the first time in a packed theater, and after that first scene ended, I heard sniffling and looked around me.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26HFSVLAGULIM	"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi"""	"VERY SIMPLY STATED:This is the most visceral, in-your-face war epic I have ever experienced. But ""Saving Private Ryan"" is much more than that, as it gives us a well-developed story line and characters we come to care about during the natural unfolding of the story.WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?:After landing on Normandy through the most visceral and graphically-realistic re-creation ever put to film, this ensemble of American soldiers and the film itself slow down to catch their breath and hand us a great story, having now prepared us for it. The heroic ""everyman"" types that comprise this small band are fleshed out as they go through their mission to find Private Ryan. It's a sort of follow-the-yellow-brick-road-to-Hell kind of mission that is just about impossible for them to reconcile. What is so important about Private Ryan? See the film and you will find out.BOTTOM LINE:Action, drama, and morality are all mixed together in the cauldron of wholesale killing that was the second World War. The ""right thing"" to do is very difficult to decipher, both by these soldiers and by us viewers, but in no film is the topic more in-your-face realistic and emotionally-supercharged.After seeing the Normandy sequences in this film, such similar epic recreations as in ""The Longest Day"" seem not just tame, but also emotionally-removed and from a safe distance. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best and most captivating films of any genre that I have ever experienced.----- CASTTom Hanks  - Capt.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2NO8RSZ37IIYR	"Henry C. Norcom Jr. ""hnorc"""	I originally saw this movie in the theatre, and received a suprise the moment the landing craft were heading towards the beach. The fear on the faces of the men instantly transported me back to a cramped Blackhawk flying into an LZ in Panama. Once again, I felt the same terror of facing the &quot;elephant&quot; the men in the movie portrayed.  To those who know what I am talking about, I experienced the &quot;pucker factor&quot;.  I made the mistake of taking a girlfriend with me and almost broke her hand because I was so caught up in the realism of the movie. The sounds of rounds hitting their target was all too real. The only thing that was missing was the acrid/sweet smell of death.This is not just a great war movie, but it is an outstanding anti-war movie.  Seeing a young US soldier die, whether on Omaha Beach, Pork Chop Hill, Hue, Panama City, Kuwait or many of the other countless battlefields, is a site I pray no one's son will ever again have to experience war in their lives.Hollywood did a disservice not only to Steven Spielberg, but the generation of American's who sacrificed their comfort to save the world. I only hope that future directors will try to bring the harsh realities of war to the screen, and not the false glory.	5.0	I took me back	2000-12-07	4	2	2

This movie is terrible, this movie is supposedly realistic yet there's an american sniper in the movie who never misses a shot.. also the German POW's in this movie are not to be trusted because they are evil! If Steven Spielberg wants to show real horrors of the war and real battles then he should make a movie about Stalingrad or Berlin where millions of German and Russian soldiers died..

The opening scene is very disturbing and bloody, but the point of it was to show us that this is what happened in that horrid war. The performances were great notably by the great Tom Hanks, and Spielberg's film will always remain a classic.After watching this movie, it always stayed with me, and I realized how lucky I am that I wasn't in that war, and how lucky I am that my grandfather didn't die in that war. I visited Normandy months after watching it, and the tour guide informed us that we were at the location where D-Day occured. We saw the many graves, and it was then that I saw what happened in this movie occur before my eyes once again. This movie is a masterpiece, and it shall always be remembered. It shall be remembered because it reported a historic fact vividly and wonderfully, and sometimes the only way for us to understand what atrocities happened in the past is reproduce these images in a movie. This is what happened with this movie and the atrocities portrayed in this movie are even more awful, because they really happened.	5.0	not for the faint of heart...	2005-06-21	3	1	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	We must recognize you can have three different visions about the war. You may have an epical approach (Spielberg, Schaffner) ; a tragic approach (Fuller, Stone) or a comical approach (Altman).Surprisingly Spielberg has taken the first sight. And this is an interesting point to remark. Spielberg assumes that challenge because his personal style has been always to rescue the dignity and the best of the human being can give and even do in the most awful circunstances.He never tells us story about loosers , nevertheless he always seeks events or edge knife situations where you must face and win. Let's forget all his sci fi proposals (whre he {s obviously a winner) and let's focus on the flesh and bond films.In Ryan he reminds us the glorious D day .No other movie in the story until now has shown more realism than this one ; the first thirty minutes of the film now has become in a classic.He puts the attention about the private Ryan ; he doesn't talk about great challenges ; he refers about the humanity which lives in men even in the worst circunstances.Schindler (his number 1 masterpiece ) runs by the same concept, but the concerns are major.With this one Spielberg signs his name in the reduced list of the great supremes war films in any age.	5.0	The second masterpiece of Steven Spielberg!	2004-06-28	1	0	1

Miller by Tom Hanks was a classic. The corporal who was afraid & hung out on the stairs while one of his friends was killed by an ss soldier was powerful. Most soldiers in combat are scared, if they say their not stay away from them. They are dangerous to anyone near them. It's what the scared soldiers do that counts. Most do their duty. At the end that soldier shoots & kills that specific ss soldier. The movie reflects on the courage of soldiers of all nations who do their duty.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2NACIQH1P8J01	Hoke	I had the benefit of doing a staff ride (field trip) to Normandy during my service in the Big Red One.  Walking through the cemetary and battlefields really brought a sense of reality to what I saw in this movie.  It is strange how places develop souls of their own.We had a history expert as our tour guide and he basically did what he called the Saving Private Ryan tour.  We went to a lot of different places that were shown in this movie as well as some others.  The tour was truly invaluable.The opening scenes of the landing at Normandy are agreed on by most reliable experts to be realistic and the best ever put to film.  After that the movie is pretty much fictional and not historically accurate although the feel is still real.The reason why I am docking 1 star is because of the scene with the crashed glider.  The General that went down with this glider was a man of honor and truly a soldier's General.  There is absolutely no reason to believe there was any special effort to protect his glider with armor plating.  This is Hollywood garbage and was unnecessary.  I put a stone on his grave as did many others to show my appreciation.  He died in action like everyone else and deserves to be remembered only with honor and appreciation.For a more realistic look at WWII watch Band of Brothers. These people were truly America's greatest generation and the entire world owes them so much.  When France did not want to help us out President Bush should have sent Chirac a copy of this and B.O.B. and said next time maybe we will be too busy, order more white flags.	4.0	Great movie but still fictional	2005-07-28	9	3	6

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A24HN75R518Y5M	"H. Suchman ""has422"""	This movie gets high marks for the battle scenes alone which are brutally terrifying. The opening scene gives the audience a taste of what is must be like for troops relying on superior numbers to overtake fortified positions. The final battle scene shows the reverse, with the heroes defending a bridge knowing they cannot succeed against the overwhelming force approaching. Speilberg makes sure neither scenerio seems very appealing. War is not fun, win or lose.The acting is top notch. Hanks in particular delivers another oscar-worthy performance. I think Matt Damon was a little weak as Ryan. Although his part is small he's a bit too pretty and cardboard for it. Otherwise the cast is excellent.The script is subtle yet powerful. The question is not 'why did they save Ryan?' but 'why did they save us?' The American soldier in World War Two was not a professional. He was the common man who patriotically went off to war for his country. The movie examines why these men gave up so much for us, for fellow citizens they didn't know. Speilberg's answer is they did so because it was their duty. He obviously feels as if this reasoning is enough, as he lays the patriotic melodrama on very thick at the end of the movie. But I don't think there's anything wrong with a little dose of patriotism every now and then.Whether you agree with Speilberg's message or not is up to you, but there's no question he made one heck of a movie.	5.0	Superb War movie	2001-06-27	3	3	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2TEV4E4ATO48I	Hunter Johnson	but certainly the greatest visual explanation of what it meant to be a soldier involved with D-Day. Certainly many viewers will be put off by the overwhelming gore depicted during the first half hour of the film, but this  scene, along with the other fire fights, are the essence of Spielberg's  masterpiece. Read &quot;D-Day, Day of Destiny&quot; by Stephen Ambrose and  you'll learn that Spielberg was not being gratuitous with the violence; he  barely scratched the surface. War is a complicated subject, and Saving  Private Ryan no doubt does not address the deeper issues surrounding World  War II. Add to this that the ending is just a bit romanticized and, in my  view, weak, and SPR cannot be considered as the last word in World War II  pictures. Nonetheless, SPR should be required viewing so that all  understand the enormous debt we owe the brave men who fought in Normandy on  6 June 1944.	4.0	Perhaps not the greatest war movie...	2000-02-18	3	2	1

This seems like just a subplot though, as you get thrown -  head first it seems, into the war, which at times seem real, there is one  particular scene that stands out in my mind, and that is when they have  approached a village, and one of the characters is shot - purely brilliant  acting, you have to see it to believe it - one warning, once you start  watching it you will get totally sucked in, so make sure you watch it in  5.1 surround, with the lights out and with some tissues and popcorn,  excellent, excellent.....one of the best films of ALL TIME.	5.0	SEE THIS EPIC - NOW.....	2000-09-07	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ALYHQ9FT0ANQU	"Igor Gershenson ""I^G"""	SPOILERS FOLLOW!  Let me first say that all of the battle sequences, especially in the beginning and the end of the picture, are astounding. Seeing them was a profoundly horrifying experience which I will never  forget.  I will never think of war the same way again after seeing those  images. Those scenes alone make the movie worth seeing.  The movie does  certainly make you truly grateful for the sacrifices made by the veterans.  However, on many other levels, the movie fails. A lot of it seems forced.  Consider the scene where Tom Hanks orders his guys to attack the German  machine gun nest.  Why would he want to do that? It makes no sense.  Why  would he decide to carry out such a risky mission considering that it would  jeopardize his main objective: finding Ryan. What if all his men were  killed? Hanks' character justifies his decision by saying that getting rid  of the nest would put other american troops passing through the area out of  harm's way. Yes, but other American troops passing through the area might  have tanks; thus, making it very easy for them to destroy the nest. Why  doesn't let Hanks' character let them take care of it instead? What if he  lost all his men?  After all doing all that and loosing one of his men,  Captain points out that his mission is about finding Ryan. If that is so,  why does he jeopardize his mission like this?  Also, the scene where Ryan  says he does not want to return and wants to stay and fight is not  convinving at all. it is too Hollywoodish for my taste.  Plus, after going  through so much to find him, the other soldiers in real life would be  furious at him for refusing to go home, yet they forgive him really fast.  Hanks decides that risking the lives of his men again to  make sure Ryan  goes back home unharmed is worth it because it is the &quot;only decent  thing to do in this war.&quot;  Why? Isn't fighting for your country in  itself a pretty decent thing to do? Isn't making sure that his own men go  home unharmed also a decent thing to do? At one point Speilberg decides  give us some comic relief with a scene that involves mistaken identity.  It  totally falls flat. It is just dumb, especially considering all the killing  and gore shown prior to that scene. The epiloque is totally unneccessary  and is just Spielberg pulling the emotional  strings. It does not work  because of bad acting. Plus, the last battle scene is so powerful that all  this corny nonsense is totally useless.  To sum up, the movie is worth  seeing because it does contain many very good scenes. Again, the battles do  have a devastating impact on the viewer. But the story leaves a lot to be  desired.  The movie would have been a masterpiece if it were just about  real life expriences of a group of soldiers. I am sure there are many  fascinating autobiographies about the period. Speilberg should have used  them instead of this contrived script.	3.0	overrated	2000-02-18	18	7	11
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2AVLIFXS0IT84	"Illiniwek ""laxdoc"""	Mr. Spielberg is very good at light entertainment, but always seems to go over the top with serious topics.  Here again he rubs our faces in the points he is trying to make -- flag-waving from start to finish,  heavy-handed dialogue, &quot;good guys/bad guys&quot; plot, and a  re-writing of history to make WWII a battle of freedom-loving Americans  against nasty Germans.If only war was so simple.  Of course many of the  individual soldiers for both sides were motivated by principle.  But  overall the role of the U. S. in the war was no less self-serving than that  of the other combattants.  The U. S. only entered the war when Japan forced  it to -- before December 1941, U. S. companies made fortunes selling  armaments to both sides, and before that, the U. S. turned away Jewish  refugees from Germany by the boatload.  The Allies made no real effort to  stop the Holocaust, though they were well aware of it.Given that, a  little less Yankee-doodle-dandy would have been in order in this  film.There were some items in the script that I found quite badly  written -- Hanks exhorting Damon to &quot;Earn this&quot; and  Ryan-the-elder saying something like &quot;Tell me I was a good man&quot;.  These lines made me groan.  They also suggest the filmmaker thinks we can't  figure out the significance of sacrifice without it being s-p-e-l-l-e-d  o-u-t for us loud and clear.  And the forced irony of having the released  German POW come back to kill the man who let him go -- totally unlikely  given the number of  troops in the area -- was really contrived.I  thought the opening battle scene was powerful but I also found it  voyeuristic, as did the kids who crammed the front rows and clearly got off  on the gore.  Just like a murderous video game.  No uneasiness, no moral  unpleasantness, just &quot;Wow, did you see that?&quot; special effects  worship, and that's disturbing.  Malick and Toll in &quot;The Thin Red  Line&quot; did a better job with the battle scenes -- chaos, carnage, the  cameras (hand-held and on cranes) putting us right in the midst of it all,  and quite uncomfortably so.All in all, I thought this film was more of a  propaganda production than a work of art.  It pretended to be historical  and then distorted the history.  Malick's film IS a work of art.  It also  made me question my beliefs, moved me out of my comfortable preconceptions,  and in telling the story implied important questions without providing pat  answers.I cared about the characters in &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;  precisely because they were so believable -- fallible, hesitant, capable of  inexplicable courage and love on the one hand and cynicism and cruelty on  the other.  Real people.  The film  (TTRL) is very faithful to the novels  by James Jones, who fought in Guadalcanal.  His (Jones's) daughter said  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is exactly the sort of film Jones would  have hated -- it prettifies war and makes it simplistic (good guys, bad  guys).  Instead of characters, it gave us caricatures.&quot;Hamburger  Hill&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Thin  Red Line&quot; are far superior.Then again, I'm a Canadian, and up here  we tend to take ourselves and our mythologies with a healthy grain of salt.  Eh?	2.0	Melodrama in the guise of history -- manipulative.	1999-10-12	18	12	6
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	In the late-90s there were two particular films that redefined their particular genres. Saving Private Ryan was one of them (the other, unfortunately, was The Matrix). Almost every war movie that followed SPR, right down to 2008's Rambo, seemed to be no more than a pastiche of Spielberg's hectic style.SPR proves what an inconsistent filmmaker Spielberg can be. The man has had his fair share of misfires (Hook, anyone?) but this was his last truly great effort. War of the Worlds and Munich were good, though hardly as revolutionary, but The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can, and the movie that called itself Indy IV were all just too gutless and inoffensive. You'd never believe they were from the same director if you didn't know better.A lot of critics have repeatedly praised SPR over the years, but they all praise the same things (the documentary style, the realism, etc.) Simultaneously, a lot of people have dismissed it as shallow, badly-written, and void of any thrills beyond the 30-minute mark. But look beneath the surface and you'll find that SPR does actually have a tight screenplay, despite going through the motions on few occasions. The wide and diverse cast (including Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, and Dale Dye) do good with the material. It's refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the 'point of view of one man' clich&eacute;.Janusz Kaminski's desaturated, gritty, high-shutter-speed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast. This look has been imitated to death over the years, but coupled with Spielberg's hurried, almost unscripted approach to the action it adds an element of authenticity to the film that the copycats have not been able to emulate.You really have to feel for all those poor soldiers who were massacred on Omaha Beach (all men, I should point out). But what a badly planned mission. No flack jackets, no smoke screens to cover their landing...warfare has come so far in 65 years, it would be insane to send so many hundreds off to die like that now. Many of them were pure cannon fodder and the Military knew it. The film certainly does not hold back on the bloody carnage. Most WWII movies up until that point were sanitized and bloodless. Hardly realistic at all!The 169 minute running time passes fairly quickly. The film certainly doesn't deserve the criticism that nothing interesting happens after the beach invasion. As it has been imitated many times since, some of then innovative moments (such as the silent 'war is hell' amid battle chaos - which this film does three times!) have become clich&eacute;s, but don't judge SPR for it.The film won 5 Oscars, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love, which is absolutely insane. I mean...what were they thinking??? SPR is most certainly a classic, and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades, while Shakespeare in Love is largely forgotten.The Blu Ray looks superb in 1.85:1 1080p. Janusz Kaminsi's photography looks just brilliant, and the sound design has to be heard (preferably at a high volume) to be believed. Loads of extras are included too.	4.0	War is hell	2011-06-12	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1JY4FALTYNZFG	Jack McPherson	This movie had all the makings of a horror film.  The evil villain, the torturous arduous ways young people die, and the absolute stupidity of the leading characters.  The opening war scene of the film (the best scene of  the film I might add) had Tom Hanks running into the field of battle with  officer stripes on his helmet.  Didn't anyone tell the director that only  soon to be dead officers wore their officer helmets with big white stripes  into battle.  Why don't you paint a bull's eye on your chest.  This movie  was filled with the most contrived scenes I've ever seen on film.  Only if  they had done one smart thing, they would have lived to tell the tale.  I  would have to rate this as one on the most obviously manipulated  disappointing films of all time.  Case in point, at the beginning of the  film you see a picture of all four Ryan boys in uniform.  Later Private  Ryan tells the story of the last time the four of them were together.  He  wasn't even in the Army at that point.  How did he take a picture with his  brother while all were in uniform. Also, in one torturous death scene.  Probably the most imbecilic of many (but you can take your pick there are  so many)  a man died in a way that is almost physically impossible to be  stabbed.  Yet we had to watch this horror scene in practically slow  motion.  I love war films, especially good ones, but this was neither.  It  was a horror film in sheep's clothing.  If Spielberg wanted to make a film  on the horrors of war, he could have done it very easily without the  contrived, implausible death scenes.  Yes people die horribly in war, but  this movie was a dishonest depiction of that horror.  I give this film  three stars.  Five for the first twenty minutes, probably the closest as a  moviegoer I've ever felt towards having been in battle.  And one star for  the last two hours.  All in all, it averages a three.	3.0	Ahoror Film without the Teenage girls.	1999-12-18	17	7	10
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ANEZJYKUDNJYQ	Jack Rice	Until I saw &quot;Private Ryan&quot; I thought the best film about World War II was John Ford and Robert Montgomery's &quot;They were Expendable&quot;.  Now I can say that what &quot;Expendable&quot; is to the  Pacific War, &quot;Private Ryan&quot; is to the European War.I think  both these films try to convey the same thought:  sometimes wars must be  fought, and we must never forget those who never come back.  To paraphrase  Tom Hanks' last lines, &quot;We must make ourselves worthy of their  sacrifice.&quot;Despite the advances in filmmaking technology that  make &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; a more intense experience than  &quot;They were Expendable,&quot; both are magnificent films that  compliment each other.  Both have been given splendid DVD transfers, and  it is fascinating to watch them back-to-back to compare how similar events  are portrayed in the idioms of two different eras.  Spielberg has the  advantage of being in an era without the constraints suffered by Ford.  Unlike Ford, Spielberg can add, &quot;And lest we forget, to bring home the  meaning of sacrifice, here's a look at what really happened to those who  didn't come back.&quot;	5.0	Compare this to &quot;They were Expendable&quot;	1999-12-04	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2KQASSE63OM7V	Jacob A. Boxer	This is my favorite movie ever, for a good reason.  It is like real war.  I can't say this from experience, because I haven't been in a war, but my grandfather has and some other grownups I know have, and they say this is EXACTLY what it is like.Other war movies are all glamorous, and usually predictable.  Two sides fight each other, some people on the main character's side die.  The main character says &quot;Ok, NOW I'm mad...&quot; (or something like it) and is suddenly amazingly skilled and kills everyone.  That's not what this movie is like at all, and it's obvious from the beginning.  When they are storming the beach, the front of a boat opens up, and immediately every single person (like 12 people) get shot.  No one has time to hide, they just die.  This is constantly repeated throughout the movie, about how everyone is equally touchable.  There is no glamour.  They have to crawl through the mud, taking loaded weapons off of dead colleagues to save ammo.Even if you took out all the war, this would be a good movie (although not amazing).  The story is set in World War II.  One mother has four sons, three of which are killed in a battle.  Tom Hanks' character, in command of other soldiers, are sent to find the mother's fourth son so the army won't have to tell the mother that all four of her children were killed at once.  The simple moral questions of this movie are intriguing enough; is it right to send 8 men to save one, no matter how sad his mother will be?This story is carried out amazingly, making you feel sad, angry, and even making you laugh (you'll know it when you see it.)  Combine this amazing story with the fantastic war scenes, and you have the best war movie ever (according to the majority of critics... Stanley Kubrick may disagree, but I dont).One other thing.  I hate war movies.  I have seen a few (Full Metal Jacket comes to mind, as well as some others), and they bored me.  So when a war movie can be my favorite, considering I hate most of the other ones, it says something.	5.0	My favorite movie ever	2001-10-30	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3VY1QHFJF0Y7H	"J. Adams ""History buff"""	"When I first saw this film, I was impressed with how the landing scene on Normandy captured the extraordinary bravery of those young men who looked death in the face and spit in its eye. I also thought the premise of the film in sending a group of soldiers to wander around looking for ""Private Ryan"" was a disappointment because it cheapened the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands who died liberating Europe from the forces of darkness. It also had the usual lapse of Hollywood history in asking ""where are the French?"" in liberating their own country. Having been to the cemeteries all over Europe, and the one at Colleville-sur Mer at Normandy where nearly 10,000 American dead are buried, I am always numb when I walk among the graves. The same is true at the British cemetery south of Bayeux, or the Douaumont Ossuaire near Verdun, the resting place of the remains of over 130,000 soldiers from all sides during WW I. This summer I went to the 60th anniversary ceremonies and talked to one of the French caretakers there about ""Saving Private Ryan."" My French is pretty good, but I thought I might have misunderstood him in his opinion about the film.  He was reluctant to talk, but finally said that he hated the film because the opening shot of the movie was really a defilement of the cemetery. When I asked him what he meant, he told me that Spielberg had moved massive amounts of equipment all over many graves unnecessarily because he wanted the shot to show two Stars of David monuments in the scene, and there is only one place that occurs among the over 9,300 crosses and a handful of other monuments identifying the faiths of those buried in the cemetery. I was stunned that Spielberg would do such a thing, but I guess he wanted to create some subliminal message in a very moving scene. I now cannot look at the movie without noticing this and thinking of what the caretaker said.This movie is good for showing just what an incredible event the invasion of Normandy represented in the history of warfare, but the rest of it really does not properly represent why so many brave men gave their lives to save the world from a monster and his goons, when 80,000,000 died after Chamberlain delivered ""peace in our time"" in 1938."	2.0	A very mixed bag	2004-10-03	13	8	5

This film is without a doubt the best movie ever made about World War II. Spielberg topped himself with this film, raising the bar for all war films to come. Tom Hanks and a stellar cast do exceptional work.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3RIIMSG5HB0J8	"""jake_l"""	Internationally acclaimed by critics and audiences alike, Steven Speilberg's World War II masterpeice, Saving Private Ryan, is an unforgettable film acheivment that has had profound and lasting impact throughout the world. The Winner of five Acamedy Awards incuding Best Director, the film also captured the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound, and Sound Effects Editing. It was robbed of the Best Picture Oscar in the single biggest act of ignorance from the Acamedy in history. More than 70 critics (including those at Time Magazine, USA Today, The New York Times, and Etertainment Weekly) and critics' groups in New York, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, and Great Britain named the film Best Picture of the Year, while Los Angeles, Toronto, and Boradcast Film Critics honored it with both Best Picture and Best Director Awards. In addition, Speilberg recieved his third Directors Guild of America Award, the American Legion &quot;The Spirit of Normandy&quot; Award, which is a USO Merit Award. It is the highest award a civilian can recieve from the Dept. of the Army. Selected for more than 160 top ten lists, Saving Private Ryan's other awards include Best Picture from the Golden Globes, and the top-grossing movie of 1998.If you have not seen this movie yet, expect to see through the eys of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's most infamous battle, the historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders all throughout the film. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one man? Surrounded by the brutal reality of war, each man seaches for his own answer-and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor and courage.My answer is that Saving Private Ryan is the best war film ever. It is very moving, to the point that WWII veterns broke out into tears in the theaters. If you are an American, and can sit through this film without feeling a sense of pride for what those boys did sixty years ago, there's something wrong. Any time you can walk away from a movie with feelings of pride, depression, hapiness, and fear all at the same time you have an outstanding movie. I believe there is a violence and language lock on the DVD so small children can watch this important film. Everyone should see this movie and you already have, you know what I am talking about. Saving Private Ryan is a film not to be missed by anyone.	5.0	On D-Day,The Greatest Danger for Eight Men Was Saving One	2002-08-08	4	2	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A4Y233WXK7DQ3	James D. Eret	There are no doubts in my mind that &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is a genuine masterpiece, redefining and refreshing the war movie genre with a harrowing realism that is unmatched by any previous war movie. This is a  movie that will suffer on a small screen. When I saw it on a large screen,  the power of the battle scenes were overwhelming, brutal, bloody,  confusing, loud, up close and in your face. When the tanks rumbled in the  film's bookend final battle the entire theater was rocking and shaking like  never before and I was looking for a place to hide. The characters  stereotypes? Hardly. Tom Hanks has been so good for so long,we take his  great acting skills for granted. His Captain Miller is wise, tough,  compassionate, complex, with his uncontrollable shaking hand, and at times  his actions and facial expressions heartbreaking. Tom Sizemore is a  powerhouse as the sergeant, saying &quot;we're in business,&quot; when  there is a chance to make a move through the carnage. But notice the more  subtle things, like when he takes small steel cans and puts the soil in  them from each country he has fought and survived in. The rest of the squad  are excellent and I want to single out Jeremy Davies as the  &quot;coward&quot; and French/German translator. Spielberg has said that  this character is the one most identify with, and if we are in danger  really, most of us don't want to fight,kill or be killed. To label him a  &quot;coward&quot; would render useless your understanding of the film's  themes. The techinical merits of this film are high,making you feel very  uncomfortable. Shooting with  mostly hand-held cameras just adds to the  realism and terror. The sound in miraculous; I'll never forget those  thousands of pinging sounds on the beach steel obstacles. The color is even  toned down, as when we see the American flag devoid of red, that some our  finest people's blood had drained the ragged flag. By all means purchase  this movie, for Spieberg has created yet another masterpiece of action. Put  it on you screen, relax for a moment, when John William's sad trumpet wails  for the lost, who gave their lives for the living. And when the landing  craft ramps go down in the bloody surf, duck and cover. The movie  transcends its genre with its gut-wrentching action and close ups of  suffering beyond anything anyone would want to imagine. Saving Private Ryan  is one of the top films of all time regardless of genre.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan: Death and Action All So Real	2000-06-08	7	4	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A21AWXE9C5IO1Y	James D. ODell	"Effective graphic art draws us in, appealing to the imagination, inviting us to participate in a viewing event.  Whatever the eye of the artist has envisioned,the eye of the beholder brings to practical focus.  The work has to communicate sufficiently for us to relate to it.  Similarly, video portraits lose audienceswhen they leave little to the imagination.  Viewers are left with nothing to dobut sit there, virtually motionless, in contrast to the multiplicity of actions that flow mercilessly across the screen.For people who have never experienced the organized chaos of war, that may come across as a credible representation of reality.  It isn't.  True to life imagesof military experience are impossible to recreate artificially, or as artifice.We know the elemental components in sea water, but the exact formula for makingit in the laboratory escapes us.  The result may taste right to us, but nothingthat actually originated in the sea comes to life in it.  Marine creatures knowthe difference, in a sense that we can only imagine.Leaving little to our imagination, simulated combat in ""Saving Private Ryan"" is testament to Steven Spielberg's.  Fertile as the prairie, it flows effortlessly into everything he does.  Unquestionably, there is no director more earnest and hardworking.  His enthusiasm is positively infectious.As an actor, I would like to work with him, since his appreciation of the craft appears to match his passion for all aspects of production.  As someone remarksin the retrospective on making ""Saving Private Ryan"" that accompanies the D-Day edition, Spielberg ""knows what he wants.""  In the broad sense, he has a vision,and a basic plan.  A formula.  Usually, it works. Sometimes, it doesn't.More telling, here, he has a positive mania for detail and storytelling, with a result that these elements sometimes combine, abruptly, forming manic images onthe screen.  In one scene on the beach, Captain Miller turns his head to resumecontact with a radio operator, only to find that the man's face has been turned into bloody pulp.  His first thought, however, is to check the radio.  From the many veterans that I have interviewed over the years of researching the landingat Normandy, even the most grizzled and combat-weary man would recoil from sucha sight, stunned into temporary immobility, faced with yet one more reminder ofhis own vulnerability.  The obliterated face is shown so briefly, if you blink,you'll miss it.The dizzying succession of images is a distraction.  If Spielberg expects me tothink about what I'm watching, I need time for that.  If his intent is to causeme to feel as disoriented as the soldiers, I think he's succeeded.  Frankly, it looks like he's tried to accomodate too much material.  Ideas stampede, crowded beach, crowded brain.To say that the storyline is carried forward too quickly more than once in this film is an understatement.  In the space of mere seconds, Ranger Miller revealsthat he has command, not only of his faculties, but of the landing, shouting an order to inform the Fleet:  ""We don't hold the beach!""I know that this scene is to show that individual men exercised initiative, butthe compression of time takes the script over the top.Andy Rooney notes in MY WAR that, for the men on the beach in the initial hoursof D-Day, the boundaries of their world were measured in scant yards to left or right.  They saw little beyond that.  Smoke covered the area.  Remarkable, what Miller and his sergeant managed to see of the enemy, using their small mirrors, servicing successful battle plans.In standard war films, chief protagonists are usually outfront, doing important things.  A clear hint that we should continue to watch them closely.  While the  theatrics in this film stray from cliche, for the most part, there are hints ofthe 1990s.  Movies, even thoughtfully crafted ones, are products of their time,and this one is no exception.  It's mostly about personal relationships.I concur with General Colin Powell's perspective on the command decisions taken, leading up to the climactic battle.  The Army has never been a democracy.  In an actual situation, everyone was accountable, and acted accordingly.Jim O'DellMilitary HistorianBuellton, CA"	4.0	"More ""Reel-istic"" than Realistic"	2009-11-24	8	2	6
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2BFIYZYNK54QX	"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale"""	Steven Spielberg is a master of filmmaking. If there was any doubt about that before, just watch the opening sequence of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and there will be no doubt. The storming of Omaha Beach during Operation Overlord was, as one of the veterans who was interviewed in the previous DVD release of this film, the watershed of the 20th Century and more than likely the definitive battle of WWII. If things had turned out differently there, we may be living in a very different world right now. But the Allies were successful at taking Normandy, but at the cost of countless lives. The sequence which details the arrival on the beach to the battle up to Dog Route One is the most harrowing sequence of the horror of war that has ever been committed to film (especially taking into consideration that, according to information I've read, Spielberg actually edited that sequence in camera). In one moment, as Capt. Miller (Hanks) observes the madness and death all around him, he sees a dazed soldier wandering around looking for his own arm. I have no doubt that this is just one example of what those soldiers saw that terrifying day, and there are many more examples throughout the sequence that will be burned into your mind for many many years.If for no other reason, this sequence is perhaps amongst the best filmmaking that Spielberg has ever done, and why this film is a classic. But the film does have its faults as well. Yes, the characters and dialogue are a little stale, and that does have an effect on the film at times. Edward Burns is the weak link of the ensemble that Spielberg put together for Miller's rescue squad. But when you have a film with great performances by Hanks, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg (whose final scene in the film is the most unsettling moment of the film), Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon and particularly Jeremy Davies, the faults of the film can be largely ignored.What Spielberg did with this film is took a very run-of-the-mill brothers-in-arms war story and elevated it above the genre.However, in 1998, there were two major WWII films released: this film and Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE. While I do respect this film immensely, I found that THE THIN RED LINE was a much more effective, profound, and amazingly acted film that, in my opinion, is superior to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, with the only exception being that Spielberg, merely from a technical standpoint, is a superior filmmaker. Again, my opinion.One of the things about the description of the product that bothers me though is that the aspect ratio shown on the page is INCORRECT. This is an anamorphic widescreen 1:85:1 and not a scope 2:35:1.	5.0	Almost perfect film. 4.5 out of 5 stars. But wrong aspect ratio...	2010-05-03	11	7	4

I have never had a movie change my life, but when I watched Saving Private Ryan, my life changed.  Not only did Memorial Day have a new outlook on my life, but the entire military gained a lot more respect from me.  People just do not realize what life was like back in WW2.  Steven Spielberg brought this to our attention.  The first half hour of this movie is the most intense filming you will ever see on the big screen.  It was just amazing.  I remember sitting in the theatre watching it and seeing grown men shedding tears from their eyes.  And when the movie was over there was just a feeling in the theatre like I have never experienced before.  To this day, I hold a grudge against the academy for not making this the best picture 1999.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2OU415LB9I5J6	Jason C. Wilkerson	"After the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach, Ranger Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is tasked to put together a platoon of his choosing and find a paratrooper from the 101st Airbourne named Private James Ryan. With the platoon of his choosing (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies) sets off in treachorous wartime France to find Private Ryan amongst a field of full of enemies and a split up 101st Airbourne.World War I is often considering ""The Great War"" or ""The War to End All Wars,"" but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the American, and the world, consciousness the way that World War II has. For the first time during a war, films were made about the war as early as 1939. Some of the greatest war films and TV series have been based on World War 2 from The Sands of Iwo Jima to Flags of Fathers to Band of Brothers. At the end of the 20th century, with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt, Steven Spielberg took another turn at the war film (following 1979's 1941) with Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is arguably the greatest war film ever made. The opening thirty minutes of the D-Day invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid. But it's not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great, it's the character building, the camaraderie between the soldiers, the devotion to duty, and the bravery of these men in combat. This movie truly depicts why World War 2 soldiers were possibly the greatest soldiers in US history.One of the great things about the casting in Saving Private Ryan is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes, and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing. Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as Capt. John Miller. Vin Diesel hasn't been this good since, and Barry Pepper as is sensational as religious sniper Pvt. Daniel Jackson. Even Jeremy Davies as the green Cpl. Upham makes you feel for his character despite his very obvious flaws as a soldier.The one thing that drags this movie down though is Spielberg's slavish devotion to sentimentality. The bookends to the film are completely unneeded and drags down what is otherwise an utterly great movie. Don't get me wrong, a former soldier's sentimentality for the one's who died to save him has it's place, I just feel as though that should have been more reserved for the former soldiers watching this movie remembering those who died with and for them then on the screen in this movie. Rather, the movie should have just been devoted to remembering the bravery and camaraderie of the men who fought in the war.Overall, though, in the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw that I have with this movie, it is definitely still the greatest movie in my mind dedicated to the men who have served our country. I don't just recommend this movie, if you haven't seen this you need to watch it, and now that it's out on Blu-Ray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it, or to watch it again.4.5/5"	4.0	Saving Private Ryan	2010-05-13	7	5	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AOQ84V0SPVGGE	Jason_Els	Many of my fellow reviewers here have commented about the violence of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; being gratuitous or unrealistic. Tragically, it is not. Having read of the Omaha landing and interviewed  people people who were there this film cannot begin to describe the horror  that our soliders faced. We see a mere 15 minutes of what lasted an entire  day to say nothing of the weeks and months and years of horrors experienced  on both ends of the earth by billions of men and women.Yet all this  harsh and brutal violence is vindicated by the ideals which shamelessly but  solemnly justify the enactment of unspeakable violence. Private Ryan is  Spielberg saying that the cost of any precious freedom does merit war and  its attendant death and maiming. However, not only do we need to be mindful  that freedom is a price above anything material but that it is paid for in  the agonizing death of the young, noble words, and stately tributes such as  monuments like this film.As an American living 50+years after D-day I  can see Spielberg's point. We are innundated by gratuitous violence that  only serves to make us believe all violence is unnecessary and terrible. We  see films and news reports everday to the point that we become inured. To  make his point, Spielberg had to up the ante and show us what a real hell  on earth war is otherwise we might dismiss Private Ryan and, perhaps more  importantly, the conecpt that war-for-freedoms can be conducted for ideals  that (should) mean more to us as a society then the comforts of home or  even our own lives. If you don't get this, Spielberg is hitting you over  the head with it in General Marshall's reading of Abraham Lincoln's letter  to Mrs. Bixby.This is not the sanitized technowar of CNN or pentagon  spokespeople. This is war forced upon us as payment for something ineffable  and precious that a handful of men dreamed of back in 1776. Perhaps America  is too jaded to wave a flag or visit the graves on Memorial Day (a US  national holiday of remembrance). &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is a call  to Americans and those of other freedom-loving nations to remember and  honor, in unmistakably stark and prideful righteousness, just what ghastly  price liberty demands.	5.0	&quot;The Solemn Pride that Must Be Yours&quot; or Why the Violence?	2000-05-29	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A6N5SXNCSY0HS	Jason	"From Director Steven Spielberg (Schindlers List; Band of Brothers) comes the most talked about film of 1998 Saving Private Ryan! With A Star Studded Cast, This Film Delievers, In More Ways Than One! In the last great invasion of the last great war, the greatest danger for eight men...was saving one. Internationally acclaimed by critics and audiences alike; Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is an unforgettable film achievement that has profound and lasting impact around the world. Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Director (Steven Spielberg), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing. More than 70 critics (including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Time, Roger Ebert and Entertainment Weekly) and critics' groups in New York, Chicago, FT Worth-Texas and Great Britain named it Best Film of the Year, with the Los Angeles, Toronto and Broadcasting Film Critics honored it with Best Picture and Best Director. In Addition, Steven Spielberg recieved the third Directors Guild of America Award, the American Legion ""The Spirit of Normandy"" Award, a USO Merit Award from the USO of Metropolitan Washington, as well as the highest civilian public service award from the Department of the Army.  Selected for more than 160 Top Ten List's, Saving Private Ryan's other honors include Golden Globes for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director, the Producers Guild of America Award and ten nominations from the British Academy Film Awards. Saving Private Ryan was also the highest grossing picture of 1998. Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, this story begins with WWII's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beaches as the men embark on a dangerous mission. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his squad made up of a battle hardened Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore),  relegious sniper (Barry Pepper), a Jewish soldier (Adam Goldber), a cocky Yankee (Edward Burns), a big hearted medic (Giovanni Ribisi) and a ""rookie"" to battle (Jeremy Davies), to find a Private James Ryan who lost his other three brothers in combat. Faced with the impossible each man starts to question orders. Whats the sense in risking eight men just to save one? Surrounded by the brutalities of war, each man must search for his own answer and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, deceny and courage. One thing that did bug me when I was watching the Academy Awards of 1998 was the fact that this was beat out by American Beauty (also won Best Actor Kevin Spacey, which was a fluke). American Beauty was an absolute delight of a film, but it didnt measure up to the emotional power of Saving Private Ryan. When I bought a DVD Player, this was the first DVD I bought and it was worth every cent, times 1,000. For one of the best war pictures ever, don't miss Saving Private Ryan, its a life altering experience!"	5.0	"""Saving Private Ryan"" Delievers! The Years #1 Movie!"	2002-06-26	11	7	4

In real life you obviously don't always have the greatest endings but, please give me a little bit of a happier ending if I'm going to pay 15 bucks for a dvd. Well, Great performance by Tom Hanks.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2FLGETO9FL3UX	"Jason Michael O'Brien ""justjason"""	Critically acclaimed, Saving Private Ryan has turned out to be one of the most important films, along with Schindler's List in the last century.  Beautifully and realistically filmed, Spielberg does an exquisite job in capturing the horror of World War II.  Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays Captain John Miller, leading his men behind enemy lines in search of Private James Ryan.Sadly the special features are few and far between, but with a nearly 3-hour movie it would be difficult to fit it all on one DVD.  Hopefully in the future there will be a more loaded version complete with feature length commentaries.  This in no way detracts from the overall experience of the movie.Overall, it is imperative that you pick this DVD up.  With the incredible transfer, sound and theme it is a must own and see by everyone.	4.0	Saving Private Ryan Review	2001-01-18	3	1	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1XFECN3V80CFS	JASSIM	Saving Private Ryan or Saving the remaining of our exsisting principle for this life. A life which it lost its features, value, the actual meaning of our existence on this beatiful earth.When I saw this film the first  time,I thought of only two things. Did gud gave us this earth to destroy it  or to live on it, and the Saving of Private Ryan was one decent example for  the mankind that taought us that we should love each other and even to  sucrify our lives for the love ones. The story of the film did brought back  to me the hope which I have lost. The hope of having decent freinds and  colleagues which they are there when you need them and they are ready to  give you anything for nothing. To appreciate the value of the brotherhood,  freindship and partnership. I feel that this film did convyed the massage  that life is still full of &quot;good guys&quot;, it is only a matter of  how good those guys are! and I feel that was the crack of the matter in  this film. I've seen the film  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for more  than 31 times! and I don't mine to watch it for another 31 times more...and  this is a fact which some of my colleagues can not beleive it!One last  thing if I may add. As I am one of loyal admirer and fan of Tom Hanks and  Steven Spielberg, I think that this film would never succeeded without  them. Of course with my great admiration to the other casts, directors and  whoever participated in the succseed of this great film.	5.0	A film which I will never forget...!	2000-05-15	4	2	2

I'll make it quick:  Im wondering if the same actor played  the role of the captured soldier, (in the scene when T/4 Medic Wade,  Giovanni Ribisi, died), and the role of the soldier who killed Private  Mellish, Adam Goldberg.  Were those two parts played by one actor or two?  If anyone can respond with the actors' names that'd be SO great, or at  least a yes or no.  In any event, I thank you all very much for your time!

I love war movies. This one is moving, riveting as the pro movie reviewing big wig dorks say, touching, of course exciting because its war. Tom Hanks does once again blow us away with an amazing protagonist performance. What is there to say? If you are into the genre and haven't seen it you must have been living on another planet for the past 14 years. Even after 14 years this film is amazing. For $5 I knew this was a steal. I can watch Saving Private Ryan on my laptop anytime? YES!Bottom line. Best war movie ever in my opinion.	5.0	I love this movie.	2013-01-02	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AISKF2I1CC5BY	"J. Capuano ""Joe Capuano (Avid Writer)"""	As a reviewer, I like to consider myself cynical, but tough and fair.  That is exactly why there are some moments in this movie where I rolled my eyes.  In fact, there were a lot of moments where I rolled my eyes.  Although I give credit where credit is due, and the action scenes in this film go above and beyond to draw the viewer into the heat of battle.The intent of this film wasn't so much to entertain as it was to educate.  Everyone had a pretty good idea of how bad the war was, but they never got to see what the combat was like and this film gives them that opportunity.  In that element, it succeeds.  The acting in this is also very good.  You really can't go wrong with Tom Hanks.  If Tom Hanks were in My Bosses' Daughter, he'd make it good.  So it's really no surprise.I try to find something wrong with every movie just to balance off all of the good and I had a field day with this one.  Whoever told Robert Rodat that he's a good writer should be flipping burgers right now.  The fact that this film got a Screenplay Oscar nomination just goes to show how bad the competition was that year.  The dialogue in this film is so weak, cheesy, patriotic, and unrealistic that it makes me wish that it was just a 30-minute short film with the opening battle scene.I got the point of this film after I saw the man with his intestines hanging out and him screaming to the sky for his mother.  It is a brutal opening scene that is very unsettling, incredibly realistic, and masterfully done by Stevey Spielberg.  Saving Private Ryan wanted to show how bad war really is, so there really was no need to drag it out for another two hours after that.  I give the four stars to the first thirty minutes and am pretending the rest of the film doesn't exist.Rated R.  In case you've been living under a rock for the past five years, you know how violent this movie is even if you've never seen it.  I have no idea why you'd be looking to buy the VHS anyway.  I'm really just updating an old review.  You know that there's more blood and guts than in most normal movies.  It's an effective film that's brutally real.  There's also swearing in it, but I doubt that'll be a big worry for you.	4.0	The most realistic depiction of war ever	2000-02-05	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A37U1LDQI2G7WP	"J. Case ""lostenroute"""	"Yes, it's gung-ho American.  True, the premise is shakey (risk 8 to save 1 private)--but they explain this quite eloquently in the movie, reading the Lincoln letter:  tear-rendering.  But in every other way this is a taut, visually stunning film that everyone will acknowledge as in whole or at least in part(s) is the definitive war epic against which all subsequent will be compared.  However. . .  Just as he did in Schindler's List, Spielberg insists on bracketing the film with a kitschy feel-good mise-en-scene.  In Schindler, it's the former Listees paying tribute to Schindler by placing stones on his memorial.  Pure schmaltz, but marginally acceptable.  The whole adult-Private-Ryan ""*Am* I a good man, I ask you, my dear wife?"" bracketing (visiting the graves in Normandy)--was a total waste.  And why does the old Ryan have bright blue eyes--much like Tom Hanks but unlike, however, the younger Ryan (Matt Damon)?  Spielberg could have done everything better and saved 20 minutes by just having an old man standing observing the Normandy gravesites and SAYING NOTHING."	4.0	Fabulous film, except for fatal flaw.	2002-01-26	4	2	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	APZC5PRJVM0PY	JD	"What people think of when they hear ""Saving Private Ryan"" is usually two things:  The opening assault on Omaha and the realism.  I agree that right out of the gate this movie is strong but the Omaha landings have a rushed ""one man army"" feel that soon takes over and then we get into the rest of the film.  From here on the movie (in my opinion) starts to fall apart.  More and more the realism is eroded until by the ending battle the movie is everything you would expect from a Hollywood blockbuster and the awe from the opening sequence has faded into memory.Don't get me wrong, this is still a fine war movie with many great qualities but it doesn't quite live up to the opening sequence and for all the emphasis on realism it is the lack of it that I feel is the movies downfall."	3.0	Starts strong but loses its way	2011-12-26	4	1	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"As an ode to the sacrifice of American heroes on D-Day and beyond, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a masterpiece. As a sublime example of the art of ensemble performance, it is superb. As a depiction of the brutality and confusion of warfare, it is extraordinary, with a number of notable exceptions. The famous first 20 minutes, depicting the Allied landing at Omaha Beach are Steven Spielberg at his best. It's loud, confusing and lethal, with the clank of metal on metal and the sound of bullets seeming to zing past your ears.The Hollywood touches just about sank this movie. The mawkish scenes at the beginning and end, showing an elderly soldier visiting the grave of Captain Miller, were emotionally out of character with the steely strength and determination of the characters in the rest of the film. And some of the walk-ons were just silly -- a blond Ted Dansen? Spielberg jammed this film full of typical war clich&eacute;s -- guys on fire falling out of pillboxes, snipers in church towers, too many guys getting shot square in the forehead and soldiers navigating perfectly through a strange countryside using crappy maps. Mercifully, Spielberg makes up for these demerits with better scenes showing foolish assaults and improvised attacks.But the star of the show was Tom Hanks. Setting aside his often comic personae, Hanks portrays a war-weary infantry officer doing a dubious duty as best he can. He keeps his men together (in company as well as in spirit), dreaming only of earning his way home with one noble act. It's a performance worthy of an armful of Oscars.The ""making of"" feature was pretty interesting, showing at length how the incredible beach scenes were shot. Guys on fire again, but interesting to see what actors put themslves through for a couple seconds of screen time."	4.0	A Spielberg/Hanks almost-masterpiece	2004-09-28	5	3	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2K9IVPCTJUQHN	Jeff Cordell	I have no pretension of thinking I can say anything new about this film. It is powerful, emotional, raw, and yes even flawed. But Saving Private Ryan is a movie. Many consider filmaking to be an art ( though very  commercial ) and like all art it isn't intended to be an absolute slice of  life - it is intended to be one person's viewpoint. It's a stylisation -  not a document. There are technical flaws, anyone who has served in the  infantry or with an infantry unit for any time at all will catch them  immediately. Yet a painting isn't expected to be a photograph - why expect  such a thing from a movie? To attack the choice of portraying Omaha Beach  and the American experience in Normandy strikes me as rather petulant as  well. This is an American film, written by Americans, made by Americans. A  British filmaker might choose day one of the 1916 Somme offensive as his  horrific beginning, a German -  Stalingrad, a Frenchman - Verdun, and a  Canadian perhaps Cambrai or Paschendale. Granted the movie  does play with  historical facts , but it dosen't affect the movie's power any less. Some  reviewers feel that the violence in the film was excessive, but I must  disagree here as well. In the medium of film exaggeration is often  necessary to carry across the full impact of the human experience. With  only one notable exception ( footage of the Marines on Tarawa Island 1943 )  all the combat footage I've ever seen is actually rather dull and  anti-climactic. The violence and death that the soldiers in the newsreel  footage feel smothered by  just dosen't carry across to the viewer who is  removed, safe. In Saving Private Ryan Spielberg gives to the audience  member the sense of how random death is on the battlefield. Unpredictable  and arbitrary. Art and exaggeration are cousins, be it poetry, filmaking,  sculpture. Saving Private Ryan conveys the physical discomfort of the  soldier in the field and the boredom. Often a soldier's day to day  exsistence ,even in combat, seems to consist of endless patrolling, long  hours of inactivity, and endless gripe sessions. No Saving Private Ryan is  not a documentary about the American soldier in WW2. It isn't about the  differences between the &quot;average&quot; infantryman who was drafted and  the hard charging Airborne/elite soldier. It's about conveying to those who  have never experience combat - and god willing never will - the sense of  what it is like. And even if the movie only brings across a third of that  reality then it's a great movie. In passing I feel like it should be  pointed out that many WW2 combat veterans who saw that movie found it  horrifying. I personally talked to one old Marine who survived three island  campaigns with the 1st Marine Division and he felt llke that movie  portrayed the life of a combat soldier more effectively then anything else  he had ever seen. I don't see how anyone can refute that gentlemen's  opinion.	4.0	Not a documentary	2000-06-12	8	6	2

It smells like war, tastes like war, feels like war, and anyone who has particapated in a war can blatantly testify to this. War is hell, and this is probably the closest many viewers will get to either.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"Tom Hanks turns in perhaps his best performance as the simple yet brave and caring Captain Miller in this World War II epic.  Hanks should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal as Miller.  The film begins with Miller and his squad as they are approaching Omaha Beach on D-Day.  The first 20 or so minutes of this film should go down in movie history as perhaps the most realistic re-creation of an actual event.  Although extremely graphic, Spielberg, who did win an Oscar for Best Director, does an unbelieveable job of re-creating the events of the landing, right down to Hanks' uncontrollable shaking hands.  The main plot of the movie is for Hanks and his squad to find Private James Ryan, whose 3 brothers were killed in combat.  The squad sets off on its strange mission and encounters some major obstacles along the way.  A pillbox manages to keep the squad pinned down, but it is finally silenced.  However, one of the German soldiers survives.  The squad members want to shoot him, but instead Miller blindfolds him and tells him to count to 1000 and walk away.  The other squad members are infuriated that Miller would let the man go, but he quiets the uprising by telling his life story before the war, explaining that he was a teacher back home and that he had no real desire to fight and he just longs to be back home with his wife lying in his hammock.  Finally, the group finds Ryan and delivers the terrible news, but Ryan has no intention of leaving his fellow soldiers.  In the ensuing battle that follows, Miller is mortally wounded, but before he dies, he utters the most moving line of the movie to Ryan: ""Earn This"".  The movie then switches back to the present day and shows an elder Ryan kneeling over Miller's grave at Normandy paying his respects to the man that saved his life.  All history or World War II enthusiasts should view this excellent movie, as it rates with such classics as ""Patton"" and ""The Longest Day""."	5.0	One of the Greatest War Films Ever	2002-07-03	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A31B1K8NEJRG74	jenne461@hotmail.com	I have seen Saving Private Ryan once, which is very unusual for me.  If I like a film, I will watch it innumerable times.  However, something has  stopped me watching this since I first saw it in the summer.  I had heard  all about it, watched the &quot;making of&quot; programme, and even knew  the ending, but nothing prepared me for what I saw.  Many people have  criticised the film for its shallow characters etc, but that is not what  the film is about.  If you want complex characters, find a movie.  This is  not a movie, but I don't know what it is.  Spielberg made this so that  people of today can understand what was done for us, and be grateful.  The  opening scene is particularly horrific because of the parody of &quot;The  Longest Day&quot; - it is not funny, but there are scenes which share the  exact screenplay with TLD, but in a completely new light (eg. the pipe  bombs).The characters in this film are all there for a purpose, and  the final touch of inspiration is the fact that you don't know who the  veteran is at the beginning - it could be Ryan or Miller.Overall, thi  film has been waiting to be made since 1945, and hopefully it will do as  intended, and help prevent the same thing happening again	5.0	This film should be reqiured viewing for every schoolchild	1999-10-28	1	1	0

The battles were more bloody, the language more course, and the emotions much more vivid than anything which had been presented on screen before hand. Yet, the film itself could not avoid the inherent melodramatic ploy which Spielberg utilizes in most of his films. The good guys are still there, and the Nazis are a pretty decent focal point of evil. Unfortunately, this is the ultimate feeling of the film, which is not at all new or innovative. ""Ryan"" is thus an old fashion film with new story telling techniques attached to it in order to give the film a more visceral impact on the audience.The film is not bad, not in the least. Yet, it seems to owe a little bit to Spielberg's past works of cinema, such as ""E.T."" and, what I think is his best film, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". When it all comes down to it, Mr. Spielberg is a very talented American director-- which means that his ability to tell a story is based on the entertainment value of the subject. Not all films must excite us, and certain not do all of the thinking for us, as this film tends to do."	4.0	A decent film, but not a great war film.	2010-04-30	17	3	14

The picture quality is amazing and the sound is beautiful, making the battles come to life.  After you see it the first time you'll still want to see it again.  Buy this movie.  And what is wrong with Bengamin Pascall, (a reviewer) The landing in the movie took place on OMAHA, a beach where the americans landed, the british and canadians landed at different beaches.  I mean come on, Britain is great but why would that persuade you to give the greatest war movie of all time down.  Buy this movie you won't regret it.	5.0	absolutley amazing	2002-03-20	1	1	0

Ordered it and will advise against those that already have the regular DVD from ordering the blu ray if they are expecting better quality.  In fact, at the start, I thought my DVD had better quality, I guess because I was expecting a bit more crispness.  With the way that SPR is shot, with the grain, I guess there really isn't anything they could do to it.I'm glad to have the blu ray, just to have it, but if you expect quality over the DVD, you will be severely disappointed.	5.0	Amazing, but don't buy BR expecting anything different..	2011-01-07	6	5	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ADQ6PI9FVUM4C	"J. Hoerth ""optiondelta"""	Many people have seen this film and had different reactions. Most good some not. The story begins with the D-Day Invasion at Omaha beach. Capt John Miller (Tom Hanks) along with Sgt. Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore) lead a squad of Rangers onto the beach of Omaha at Normandy. The next 20-25 mintues are the most intense and realistic I have ever seen. The battle never slows down and does not cover up any realism. Blood, guts, shooting, explosions, men praying and calling out. It is all shown and should be. Some people may quesion why would anyone want to see this. Those of us that have served in the military want those who have not to see what it is like to serve in the military. Not for people to feel sorry for those who have, but to understand a different way of life. After the invasion, Miller is given an order that he and his squad must go behind German lines locate and bring back a Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon) from Iowa. It is no secret that his three brothers are now KIA! Some people complained that the characters where not real enough, or stereotypes. Isn't everyone given this? Before you meet them or after? Each platoon or squad in the military is like this, some nice men, others not! Plain and simple. Along for this mission is a new man to the group Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies) a interpreter. Men that had landed with Miller are the backbone of the film. Pvt. Reiben (Ed Burns) who likes black humor and has a quick temper, Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel) a large well hearted man. Many viewers have to look twice to realize that this is Diesel in an early role. His acting abilites are strongest in this film. A man deeply religious Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper) and Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg) a Jew who toys with German prisoners about his religion. In the rear is Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) a medic who is caught in the wind of the war without a rifle. His job is simple yet could be anything but-save lifes.As they go with this mission they begin to argue why are they trying to find one man when there are so many of them. What is so special about Pvt. Ryan? They have mothers too.When they finally find him Ryan refuses to go since all his brothers are dead. He will not leave the ones he has left. Capt. Miller who has kept the squad together the best he can runs into a road block, stay and help defend the bridge or take Pvt. Ryan against his will and go. The final battle is no less brutal. It takes your breath away and won't let you go. It makes you appricitate freedom. People around the world need to understand that this is a film about Americans in WWII. Were not saying we won the war ourself. We didn't. That a squad would not walk so close in the open and talk. Used to keep the movie going, thats it. Battle scene's too brutal. People also need to see what it is like for those who serve there country in the military so they may live free! Winner of 5 Academy Awards. Best Director Spielberg, also won for cinematography, editing, sound and sound effects editing. Best film and most important one I have ever seen.Grade:A+	5.0	&quot;This time the mission is a Man!&quot;	2004-06-06	4	3	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2F4NY67MAJB4J	"jignbobber ""steelhead"""	Th battlescenes are breathtaking.  But that's it.  the movie lacksrealism.  Germany had mostly second rate and foreign conscripts guarding the walls of Normandy.  By 1944, the Wehrmacht had been bled white.  The US and British troops had an incredible numerical superiority.  the movie shows the german troops as these wel equiped soldier where in fact most units were a ragtag of blended units with a few veterans left in hemAlso the last battle turns the movie into Rambo.  If indeed they had been faced with tanks.  The germans would have never let the tanks advance into ruins and be easy prey to close up ambushes.  the tiger's 88mm main gun would have obliterated the defenders fron long range.Finally, that charge on the machine gun nest where Giovanni Ribisi dies is a bit laughable.  The whole platoon would have probably died during a head on charge in a real settings.  The germans had in a place a fearsome MG-42 with an over 2000 rounds/minute rate of fire.  they would have been cut to pieces in no time.In terms of &quot;spectacle and entertainment&quot;, I give the movie an A.  In terms of realism it's a D.	3.0	Lack realism	2001-03-15	15	7	8
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1VZ3Z8GP156F2	Jill R Handel	Saving Private Ryan is the definitive film regarding Operation Overlord. For once an un dramatized view of war is offered in this film. This film is so effective, because it forces the audience to abdon their innocence just like those young men who fought in the Second World War did repectively. Tom Hanks gives a great acting performance, but he feels out of place in a war movie.The best performance of the movie is that of Matt Damon as Private Ryan. In this role, he plays a wide-eyed young man who is thrust into a fight for his life and for freedom. In this he symbolizes so many like him in the era. Anyway, this movie along with The Thin Red Line are the best contemporary films on the Second World War, and I would recommend either to anyone wanting to be sobered by the true, unromanticized nature of war.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan	2003-02-22	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2RWDGTILUSSEN	Jimbo	"Probably the best American war movie.  It will be a classic, played on network TV for years to come.  Spielberg & Hanks delivered a real treat.  I still can't believe that it lost ""Best Picture"" to 'Shakespeare in Love.'  The movie speaks to those who have served unlike any other movie.It leads the viewer to a glimpse of the horror of war and to an admiration of those who have sacrificed so much to fight for what they believe.  Hanks' performance also shows how free soldiers face into the terror and Charlie Mike (continue mission).This is a move everyone should see.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2NJU6KZVSWU1X	Jimmy Juice	SPR is the greatest war movie ever. Okay, maybe films like From Here to Eternity might have been a tad bit better, but there is no doubt: in the long run, SPR will be 20 times more respected than it is now, and it  already has war vets crying. The battles are amazing, like none ever put on  film, and the drama reaches beyond the other war films and tips your eye,  causing them to leak with one half happiness and one half sadness. Hanks'  death helps separate this from most war films, and all performances are  good, especially the newcomers. Much better than the emulating Thin Red  Line. See it tonight, remember it forever.	5.0	Amazing War Epic	1999-12-05	4	1	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1T49SQP0YD716	JImmy K.	Quite simply the greatest war film ever. Anyone who believes that the characters are stereotypes spend too much time reading reviews from fat, cynical critics. Though cliched, every member of the squad comes across as  nothing else but real human beings; men who break down after battle. The  battle scenes are incomparable, not only the gut-wrenching opening scenes  but the last fight as well. The part where the German soldier slowly sinks  his knife into and American while the American is asking what he's saying  is so unique and horrifying that it is unlikely to ever be replicated.  Should be mandatory viewing for anyone who has ever wondered why the pledge  of allegiance is said at school.	5.0	best war film ever	2000-04-19	5	4	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3RB6NQOLOBXYD	"Jimmy Lee ""James"""	Saving PRivate Ryan was an excellent movie based on WWII. Stephen Speilberg made this movie tragic, scary, violent, and very realistic. Stephen speilberg showed what war really lookes like in Saving Private Ryan. The movie itself had an excellent plot, which was finding private Ryan, (Matt Damon) telling him he was the only brother alive out of the other three.Tom Hanks also did a magnificent job in playng the captain. All these actors played very great roles. the acting was also very well done. I don't think any war movie comes close or compares to this.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A4O1A5AZGX2FN	"""jimvic7"""	A few comments below mine a gentleman from Rhode Island (I believe) points out a flaw in the SPR DVD during chapter 12. He mentions the screen pauses briefly before the movie continues. This is not so much a flaw but an  annoying trait of dual layer DVD's (meaning the whole movie is crammed on  one side rather than distributed across both sides) This layer transition  also causes problems with certain brands of DVD players.In fact, the  first copy of SPR I bought had tons of digital noise and interference at  the layer change. I returned it and received a copy that works correctly,  meaning it pauses briefly during the layer transition. The main problem I  have with dual layer disks is the quality seems to suffer. SPR is NOT  brilliantly rendered in DVD. It sounds great, but the look is not as crisp  as other non-dual layer movies I have, which you have to flip, like  Goodfellas and Stargate.My advice is to skip this title until  Dreamworks gets a little more experience in the DVD game and reissues it  one day, which I'm sure they will after the limited edition version runs  its course.Not, one of my favorite DVD titles. Not even close.	2.0	Flaw at the radar station?	1999-11-24	7	3	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1X1CEGHTHMBL1	jjceo	A man and his family walk into a military cemetery in France along the beaches of Normandy.  He falls to his knees as he remembers his actions during the war and the deaths of his comrades.  The movie flashes to the past and he sees the landing of amphibious carriers heading to the Normandy shoreline.  The Germans have fortified the beach to be impregnable from invasion.  The slaughter is horrendous and the ocean beach is red with blood.The government finds out that 3 of the 4 Ryan brothers are killed within a few days of each other.  They send in a special unit lead by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) to find and bring back the fourth brother, Private James Francis Ryan to be sent home. The team goes into the war with a mission to find him but along the way they encounter the war in its worst and the story is about their experiences....This is an excellent movie and it brings the horrors of war to the front of your mind.  You see what our troops had to sacrifice during the war.  It is a good story based in the most horrific background of a deadly war.  This movie is one of the most intense movies I have ever watched and its realism is what makes the story so powerful.I recommend this movie to you as a first class movie and it should be in your collection.  I have to tell you that this movie is violent and shocking.  Just be prepared to see the horrors of war.

I'm no tech-buff, so I can't say if the DVD is the perfect translation from the movie, but I can't find much to complain about. The sound is great, and I found myself lost amidst the big battles and gunfights. As for the plot, it goes through all the ups and downs of a war, people getting torn apart between values and priorities, finally succumbing to the impossibility of it all and doing things that border on the fantastic. It's very riveting, you will be too busy being angry and sad with the people in the movie to nitpick about some inconsistencies.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AB82TJ90A0O6Z	Joey	Saving Private Ryan is a great movie. Its kind of gory though. Theres a lot of scenes with people blowing up and arms and legs getting blown off. But most of it is during the first half hour when it shows D-Day. Its about 8 soldiers go looking for James Ryan because all 3 of his brothers were K.I.A and he is the last one and they want him to go home. The ending is not what you expect. Its a great movie but its sad and its not funny at all. If you want a happy movie about barney or something dont watch this. If you like war movies you should try watching this.	5.0	Great Movie	2004-08-03	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3DVYM6TVI369Q	John E. Erdman IV	I found Saving Private Ryan to be a lot less enjoyable than I hoped it would be.  It was, of course, extremely impressive in its scope, remarkable in terms of its humanity and most stunning in visual and audio effects.But the writing and much of the acting was rather poorly done.  I really enjoy dialogue and the interaction of characters and while some of the key roles in the movie had interesting things to say, they always managed to say it in a way that made me less interested than I should have been.  This prevented me from getting absorbed into the story.It could have been a great movie, but it fell short.	3.0	Good, but not Great	2004-03-04	9	4	5
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"A virtuosic, hard-hitting war film by Hollywood icon Spielberg, ""Ryan"" opens with an intensely violent 24-minute battle sequence that many claim is the most realistic ever committed to celluloid. (It's certainly powerful--reportedly, a number of WWII veterans experienced post-traumatic shock watching it.) But the film's true achievement, apart from its Oscar-winning editing and visual effects, is its charged storyline and debate over the merits of bloodshed. Aided by a first-rate cast including Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, and Giovanni Ribisi, ""Ryan"" honors the sacrifice of soldiers while acknowledging that war truly is hell-on-earth."	5.0	Saving Private Ryan	2007-07-13	3	1	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2D0IBZ3ZTC4KP	John Jesensky	This was the first movie I ever bought on DVD, and finally just replaced it on Bluray.  This is, without a doubt, my favorite Spielberg film.  This film manages to paint a very vivid world out of the most tattered Europe brought to film.  On top of that, it manages to send so many powerful messages about mankind and war.  On top of that, it brings forth the best performances I've seen out of every single actor in it.  On top of THAT, it manages to entertain the hell out of you.It's a hard watch...moments can be tough to stomach.  This isn't a horror movie where bright red caro syrup shoots out at the camera with giddy delight.  This is realistic battle, and you feel every single bullet wound, punch, defeat, and victory.  You WILL be emotionally exhausted after this film.  And yet, you will want to watch it again, and again.Most say that Schindler's List was Spielberg's masterpiece.  I certainly agree that it was massively important, and a work of art.  However, in terms of pure cinema storytelling...this is where the man reached his pinnacle in my opinion.	5.0	The Perfect War Movie	2014-02-21	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW	John K. Reed	The first 30 minutes are far and away the best combat scenes ever filmed in peace time.  Savagery, chaos and incomparable courage.  No words can adequately describe them except to say that they should not be viewed by  the faint of heart.Our WWII veterans are long overdue in terms of the  appreciation or lack thereof given by the public at large.  Unfortunately,  this film only touches on the most elemental truths about war and the many  diverse warriors who participate.  The film certainly makes a statement  just not necessarily the strongest statement.  For that you need to check  out the monumental masterpiece 'The Thin Red Line' and the so often  overlooked 'When Trumpets Fade'.It's a story that deserves to be told I  just think that there are better vehicles to pay homage (in their entirety)  to our veterans than this one.	3.0	Superb combat scenes but little else.	2000-02-17	5	3	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A126JVOAOOR42V	John McConnell	"This film is indisputably classic.Having scanned dozens of amazon customer reviews, reviews much better than mine would be, it seems interesting instead to focus tightly on a few criticisms of others' by way of review. So here goes my ""review of the reviews"".1. The beach. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) reaches the beach sopping wet but his clothes are dry when the bangalores clear a path through the minefield. There was a several hours delay from hitting to taking Omaha Beach. Spielberg compresses hours into minutes.2. Air cover. Significant air cover usually stops at a beach. It's too close to risk kills from friendly fire.3. The machine gun nest. Why did Miller bother, why was the nest frontally assaulted rather than flanked, and how could a mere half-squad of Rangers even survive such an assault?In a word, surprise. It takes a few crucial seconds to collect your wits, grab your helmet, chamber your rounds, and start delivering return fire in any ambush. Meantime grenades are heaving in at you - if you're still alive. As the Rangers assault the nest, the Brooklyner Reiben has a thirty-caliber Browning assault rifle and been ordered to set up a ""base of fire"". If you've never been fired at by a thirty-caliber machine gun set on automatic at close range, you may just not realize how really distracting something like that can be. Even *behind* sand bags.Next, mines and patrols. Machine gun nests are unhappy places. They're typically surrounded by anti-personnel mines. Flanking a machine gun nest is unhealthy. Moreoever, enemy patrols will periodically stroll around, so waiting around to ambush the bad guys, or waiting for night to fall, is a judgment call.The math goes thus: Seven guys, one (basically) a noncombatant and another a medic, leaves five guys. The platoon sergeant sits out the ambush (so whatever happens there will be one good fighter left to keep looking for Private Ryan) leaving four guys. Now we have one guy set up a base of fire, and that leaves three guys to ambush the machine gun nest - Miller, Mellish, and Jackson their sniper. Not enough. So the medic gets called in for moving target duty and dies horribly.Miller's reasons for assaulting the nest made sense. He got lucky to be unspotted. The next US patrol very likely would not be so lucky. Bad guys with nasty weapons were all over northern France in those days, and the essence of being a squad leader in that scenario is hit and run before you're pinned down and pounded. What did not make sense to me in Miller's assault was neglecting to use his sniper Jackson to pick off the German machine gun crew once they started opening fire. Nor did not opening up with long-range grenade throws make sense to me.4. Final small unit action at Ramelle. You're the commander of a heavily armored recon element sent to take a vital bridge. You've got no air cover and no time. Your predecessors have had their pants thrashed by a small arms unit that was there, a unit that to your knowledge has not been reinforced - just some shell-shocked guys low on ammo who basically are cut off.My first guarantee is you are unlikely to play it safe and send in your infantry to get chewed up piecemeal. Remember, this is your unit. These are your men. You're very likely understrength without reinforcements as every other unit commander is screaming for them. Street fighting is as bad as it gets, as the German Sixth Army discovered in Stalingrad when they were losing 20,000 men a week (yes, that's right, an entire division) in this same kind of fighting.My second guarantee is you're confident of crushing a cut-off small arms unit. So what's your best approach with four tanks, a 20 mm cannon, several halftracks, and your infantry company that's likely been forced-marching? You know the enemy can't take out your two Tiger tanks with direct fire so you give orders to your infantry to stay close to the tanks to protect them. Then you simply take your chances. One street or the other is what it boils down to. The sooner you get the bridge the better. Go go go. If you're the commander on the spot, what other options do you have?5. Give your orders.6. Pray.7. Watch your set-piece battle vanish.Again, this film is an absolute classic.Ps, If anyone knows what the SS soldier says to Mellish as he knifes him through the heart, please comment, and thanks."	5.0	Scoping in	2001-04-19	13	7	6
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2CIOPJD8GYL8	"John M.

Ryan segment is told however times and many events are true surrounding that story.It is a masterpiece of films, technical advisors were actual soldiers that took part in that event in the 1940's and survived it, that is why all was done realistically and it wasn't a ""Hollywood Special Effects"" contest from scene to scene or over any films to that date, it was as it was in the days of the war, nothing more and nothing less.It was symbolic of the ""Greatest Generation"" That Ever Lived and hats off to Stephen Spielberg for his masterpiece without comparison.As for the delivery, price and condition of the DVD, it was perfect, on time, exactly as stated by the vendor."	5.0	A more realistic war film you won't find anywhere.	2010-12-30	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2K257CW86M2AM	john myung lee	The documentary style cinematography, the absence of hollywood-style bravado, and the graphic content of this film make for a chilling experience that makes for many redundancies in the reviews.  It is an  awesome movie and deserves all the credit it receives.  It may, however, be  too disturbing to watch many times.  As for the format of this  masterpiece, DVD shows much promise from its transfer of its  documentary-like hues and tones (although being color blind hinders  accuracy); however, the sound through a Denon DTS/Dolby receiver wasn't as  earth shaking as the Laser Disc version (yes I still have one of those  clunkers).	5.0	dvd sound not as good as laser disc format	1999-12-23	1	0	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A23VGBG17K5NJ3	John Nolley II	The sheer emotional power of this film makes it one of the greatest tributes ever to the soldiers who fought and often died to make our world what it is today.  Saving Private Ryan is on many levels an outstanding film--from the excellent performances of a star-level cast to the brilliant special effects to the cinematic capture of the essence of the horrors of war.The story itself may be rather secondary to the imagistic power of the film.  The first forty-five minutes or so focus on the Allied landing and invasion of Normandy, where one cannot help but imagine and feel the forces of chaos roiling around each and every soldier.  Even the hardest viewer likely will shed a tear at the horror of combat or the bravery and valor of the soldiers called to fight.  The long combat sequence may even overwhelm some viewers but is perhaps one of the truest pictures of war that any non-veteran is likely to experience.Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing for anyone advocating the use of military force to solve our problems, a primer in the dirtier aspects of combat most of us would rather ignore.  So should it be required of anyone who has disparaged the honor of our armed forces, for even those reluctant to fight deserve our utmost respect when called to do so, and this film offers renewed appreciation of those soldiers who have defended our freedom through time.Overall, it is difficult to see how Saving Private Ryan did not win Best Picture--it is simply that good.	5.0	Powerful Tale of Courage and Terrible Nature of War	2003-03-13	3	3	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A332MW6OA1LYDF	John Noodles	This may well be one of the best--and most gruesome--war movies ever made. It remains a cut below Platoon, however, because--yet again--Spielberg just COULDN'T avoid weepy sentimentality.  The framing device he uses--the old man whining at the head stone, adds nothing to the movie, and takes away much.  As a final image, it needs to resonate with the rest of the movie, to emphasize what has come before it.  Watching the old guy wimper to his wife about his having lived a good life is an utterly unearned emotion. The quality of his life, his character, after the period of the movie's narrative is never shown, so ALL we know about it is what he and his wife tell us.  We are shown nothing, in other words, and so what is meant to be a moving moment remains flat...unearned emotion.  We are being told how we ought to feel about this, without being given any detail to make that feeling genuine.It's a very brief moment in an otherwise excellent movie, but that it is the final image taints the experience of the whole movie--it is, after all, the final impression we are left with.This movie contains some of the most graphic, brutally honest battle scenes ever filmed, I think.  Young men (and women) should watch this before enlisting!  It might give them pause.This is Spielberg's best work since Jaws (which, in my opinion, is still his best movie).	4.0	A Great, But Flawed, War Movie	2000-10-17	10	4	6

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3H42LMDM2M7J4	Johnny448	Saving Private Ryan is a great film. Out of all of the war films I have seen, this would probably rank as my favorite. The war scenes are spectacularly choreographed. It'll make you feel like you are in Normandy during World War II. The directing is top notch. Stephen Speilberg richly deserved the Directing Oscar that he received for this film. The real stars of this film are the sound, cinematography and editing. Out of all of the films that I have seen that were made in the 90's, this has to be best of those three. The camera work is awesome. They used a type of camera that made the images look more documentary-like which enhanced the feel of the movie. The sound is earth shattering. It sounds just like the battle is happening right in your living room. And last, but not least, the editing is magnificent. The scenes, cuts and different camera angles make you feel like you are actually witnessing all that is happening. Get this film!!!	5.0	One of the Greatest War Films of All Time	2004-08-26	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2KW8K3Q5PAO2F	John Peter O'connor	The Vietnam experience changed war films forever. Not so much the war or its outcome but the fact that we had all seen war live on TV news broadcasts. No more would film makers depict war as an opportunity for John Wayne types to be heroes in an environment where blood was never seen and death was quick, non graphic and usually off camera.With Saving Private Ryan, director Spielberg sets out to take the depiction of the horrors of war to new heights. The opening section showing the first bloody minutes of the Normandy landings in 1945 must be the most blood drippingly violent sequence in mainstream cinema. It is also, by repute, the most accurate depiction of the landings ever on the screen.The explicit violence and special effects are wrapped around a plot that would have done John Wayne proud in the pre Vietnam era. Three brothers, serving in different parts of the world are coincidentally killed at the same time. The fourth brother, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is lost somewhere behind enemy lines in France in the immediate aftermath of the Normandy landings. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks)  is sent, with a small group of men to find Ryan and bring him out of France so that he may be sent home.Don't expect the plot to bring you any surprises or any real suspense. Don't expect to be moved by memorable acting. It's not that kind of film. The cast are competent and the script is slick but the film really stands on its special effects, action and pace. These are all spot on, it was these aspects of the film that won Oscars and they combine to produce a film that is well worth watching.It's not for the squeamish and its concentration on effects and action mean that the character building necessary to carry any real message just does not happen. However, those factors do not detract from the film's ability to keep an audience's attention for three hours and you will carry the images of the film with you for a long time afterwards.	4.0	Not perfect but a great film	2000-11-21	7	5	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A12U6YJLMBLJ86	John Wayne	Spielberg's overarching message in Saving Private Ryan is that after 54 years, the Allied myths about World War Two continue to hold true--Studs Terkel's pivotal reference point--&quot;The Good War&quot;--is confirmed.  There are good wars, by golly, and WWII was it. Hip, hip,  hooray!Spielberg chose to advance his agenda by transparent means. One  of these is the suggestion that the Wehrmacht--mostly conscripts, if we  recall our history--are practically war criminals just for fighting the  Americans.Moreover, Spielberg the &quot;humanitarian&quot; telegraphs an  unambiguous message about the necessity of shooting unarmed German POWs and  how foolish it is not to shoot them.One of the most compelling  principals in the film is the Sgt. York character-- a Protestant  fundamentalist from the South who's a diehard German-hater. When a POW  speaks to him in German, he erupts in a rage, saying, &quot;Shut that  filthy pig Latin!&quot;&quot;Pig Latin&quot;? German being the language  of philosophy and rocketry, among other stellar Teutonic achievements,  Spielberg would seem to be both applauding and mocking the anti-German  bigotry of this &quot;hick,&quot; who mutters a psalm every time he blasts  any German who gets in his sniper rifle's sights.How the Germans ever  conquered Europe and North Africa and fought the Red Army to the gates of  Moscow is certainly a mystery if one credits their portrayal in  &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; They fight with basic soldierly resolve  only as long as they have the advantage--a fortified pill box, a machine  gun nest or a Tiger tank. But as soon as the tide turns, the German  soldiers toss their arms into the air and jabber in hysterical fear and  pleading.They fight with the same wooden stupidity as did the extras on  the set of the old 60s TV series &quot;Combat&quot;--as soon as they are in  American sights they get hit and drop, whereas American troops can run in  front of a legion of Wehrmacht rifles and machine guns while dodging  bullets with miraculous invulnerability.The Germans are mere ciphers.  Never does Spielberg take us to their campfire to hear their songs and  stories. We almost never glimpse their humanity. No German words are ever  translated into sub-titles. German becomes an unintelligible clamor--a  &quot;pig Latin.&quot; We are glad whenever the German boys die and  Roosevelt's troops prevail.To sum it up, pure propaganda and a complete  falsification of History would better describe this germanophobic  movie.John	1.0	Saving Steven Spielberg	2000-07-16	123	51	72
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26B5KOZU5CPS3	John White	The best part of this movie is the realistic battle scenes. There are two of them lasting nearly a half hour each. The gritty fighting scenes (and, yes the gore and suffering depicted) do homage to the brave US soldiers who fought at D-Day and beyond.The unrealistic parts were that the leader, the Captain played by Tom Hanks, allowed his elite soldiers to walk through enemy territory bunched close together, talking, and not paying attention to their surroundings. Further, he even asked for volunteers for a dangerous mission rather than ordering certain soldiers to go.	4.0	Great Battle Scenes	2014-02-20	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3DAF0C699RTQ3	"John W. ""motoko_uk"""	Spielberg is a director that has always used big openings to kick off his films and get the audiences attention. Witness the nightclub fight in Temple of Doom or the initial shark attack from Jaws to get a good idea of  what I'm talking about. But this is easily his best shock tactic opener  since a boulder starting chasing Indy in Raiders of the Lost Ark.The  first twenty minutes of this film will have you ripping your teeth out as  you bite harder on your knuckles in the sheer frenzy at Omaha Beach. It's a  terrifying vision of battle that thrusts the viewer right into the heart of  combat and shows you what bullets do to a person. They do not punch nice,  neat, Hollywood holes. They maul, shred and crush their targets and the  results aren't pretty. After the opening the film settles down while  Spielberg tries to get you to care for the characters for 90 minutes before  throwing them into battle again. He succeeds but we never learn as much  about them as we really should. Hanks' Miller is a fully developed  character that will appeal to all but the others seem like shadows. He  never get to know them as much as we should and our opinions of them are  usually bulked out by what we know of similar characters from other films.  By the final hour however such details become unnecessary as Millers troops  are eventually whittled down and then topped up again by a second platoon  who we never get to meet at all. I spent a lot of the final sequence trying  to work out how many of them there were as they numbers seemed to keep  fluctuating all the time.A lot of critics have pointed at the rather  polarised view of the war that SPR takes and they do have a point. The  Americans are shown as scared young men that are bravely putting themselves  in the way of a bullet for the cause of freedom. The Germans get treated  much less kindly and while they never stoop to the &quot;Evil Master  Race&quot; cliche often employed they're usually shown as cowardly,  snivelling, backstabbing turds. The Thin Red Line achieved better  characterisations of soldiers at war by showing the bad side of 'Good' and  the noble side of 'Evil.' For such a self claimed 'Honest' portrayal it's  very choosy about which truths it tells you. But if the characters are  stereotypes they're well written, well acted stereotypes and when Spielberg  does get around to showing the frailties of his troops he does so with  tremendous pathos. It's just a shame that he shoots himself in the foot  with his ending. After showing war as a pointless mindgrinder at the start  he then implies that a few good men can make the difference. It confuses  the theme but of course a low key ending would mess up the conventions of  war films.SPR is better as a reminder of who we owe our freedom to  rather than a gripping cinematic vision. Don't delude yourself that your're  crying (and you will cry) for the characters on screen. You're crying for  God-knows how many thousands that died running up Omaha 60 years ago. It's  great but it's not the best. Das Boot, a GERMAN war film, holds that crown  and will continue to do so for a very long.	4.0	It's great but it's not the best.	2000-02-04	4	4	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2TNW09AXC2V0K	"Jordan Fletcher ""Jordan Fletcher"""	This movie is pretty deep.  I have never seen a movie as realistic and &#34;war-time realistic&#34; as this one.  I shouldn't have been suprised when I read that Steven Spielberg was the one who directed the movie.  I will tell you though, that there are quite a few gory parts.  But it is extremely realistic, which is why I am warning you; not like modern movies (&#34;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#34;), like when a grenade explodes underneith their feet, the soldiers in this movie don't go flying forward with zero obvious physical injuries.  No no no, they loose limbs in such a realistic way it is nearly petrifying.  After watching that movie on Memorial Day, I had a whole new level of respect of those who served and who are serving in the US military, especially the ones who didn't make it back.  In other words, I totally recommend it to anyone who won't panic (or anything worse) at the sight of a soldier slowlying dying as he looks at his intestines sprawled out on the beach next him...if you can take it, watch this movie!  The story line, characters, EVERYTHING in this movie is amazing.  Totally recommend it and that is why I give it five stars.	5.0	Outstanding Movie	2014-05-27	0	0	0

Under my opinion technically almost perfetc. Excellent fotography, marvellous sound... but the history is a remake from other picture from the 40's.I  believe we all are enough intelligents to understand the overall situation  without the two flashbacks. In the begining of the action on the beach, I  don't understand where the people hides when the camera looks from the  german machine gun point of view, from this point all the script is  excellent and fresh until the meddle of the movie, it looks almost  documental.  But when the command arrives to the german machine gun nest...  from this point to the end of the movie the tone of the history changes and  follow the way of others greats war and adventures movies. We can see if we  forget the flashbacks.	4.0	Don't need flashback to understand movies	1999-09-29	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A37IU061LVKF4Y	Joseph Guindi	"This is a pretty good movie from the production standpoint. The scenes are vivid, bloody, gory, disgusting, and in some parts surreal -- which many veterans say appropriately depicts how war feels. While I thankfully will probably never know what D-Day was like, this film gets us closer to knowing how it was than without it.It needs to be gory. As one veteran put it in the 25 minute documentary (paraphrasing from memory), ""It's good to know the horrors of war. That way, we think twice about engaging in it."" Politics aside, that certainly has special meaning today. There are lots of additional points about the reality of day-to-day war, in all its unpleasantness.However, I did not enjoy this movie. I'm a WW2 enthusiast. In fact, I recently came back from a trip to Normandy. I'm not going to go on about pointy factual historical inaccuracies, that exists in any film.However, I found it truly offensive that the story involves only American soldiers, enemy German soldiers, and feeble French civilians. I've no problem with the point of view from an American unit, but in the story all the units get mixed up, intermingle with others, etc. But they don't seem to mix with British and Canadian troops for some reason. They never meet any members of the French Resistance, which numbered in the hundreds of thousands and were crucial to the Battle's success. Ditto for the Free French Forces, Polish forces, all of whom were also involved. In fact, the only mention of other Allied troops is through the nickname ""Monty"" referring to the British, that they called ""overrated"". They were not overrated. It's okay if one character says that, but it's insulting if it's the only mention of other countries' troops.This is not only insulting to other veterans who also died in the war, but is a continuation of the propaganda that only America liberated France. Of the five Normandy beaches, only two were American, two more were British, and one was Canadian. We were all in this.Responsible for this is the historical consultant, ""historian"" Ambrose. In the documentary recalling the context of D-Day, he doesn't even mention that its purpose was creating a 2nd front, to the Russian front, in fact he nor anyone else doesn't mention the Russians participation, and went so far as to say that without D-Day that Nazis would still be there today. Such blatant nationalist arrogance from a historian is simply not acceptable.For decent retelling of D-Day, watch ""The Longest Day"", filmed on location, telling multiple sides of the story; it's not as well-made as Saving Private Ryan from a production standpoint, and the characters feel thin, but it's accurate. Also check out ""A Bridge Too Far"". Sadly, no recent film manages to adequately capture WW2; they're either biased, glorifying of war, touchy-feely, or generally demonising of German soldiers. If you're really serious about D-Day, go to Normandy, at Caen, Bayeux, Pointe-du-Hoc, Colleville-sur-mer, and the tons of museums there, especially the Caen Memorial."	3.0	Well-made film, but poorly written	2003-10-27	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2KAZ9WPPT6LSY	"Joshua Charles Copeland ""biblio caretaker"""	"SPOILERS ALERT:Okay, great action movie. Great performances. Great cinematography. But...the film moralizes that it does not pay to be ""decent"" in war, and that it DOES pay to break the rules of war. Captain Miller and crew capture a Wehrmacht soldier. The Law of Land Warfare and 3rd and 4th Geneva Conventions state it would be a war crime to kill him. Captian Miller lets him go. Reiben derides this as ""the decent"" thing to do. Upham argues that killing the soldier would be ""against the rules."" The Wehrmacht soldier, most likely, kills Captian Miller in the finale stand off at the bridge. So the movie maintains that Upham and Miller were wrong to let the soldier live, that it was wrong to be ""decent"" and follow the rules. Both Upham and Miller are a bit nerdy, well educated, and quasi-intellectual, so the movie also makes the point that educated individuals have no place in war. An F Off to many war protesters. (Upham is a map maker, another sign of his inability to get down and dirty and fight, to hold tightly to his objectivity and to his inability to have what it takes to be a real soldier) (Incidentally, in Brian DePalma's Redacted, the soldiers that don't go along with the rape and murder of the Iraqi citizens are educated. So De Palma seems to disagree with Speilberg and Ryan scriptwriter, Robert Rodat, on this point, though i do know Spielberg and De Palma are great friends).There's a reason this movie was shown unedited on television when the war with Ahafganistan (sp?) started (a necessary war): to disseminate its ethics out to the US populace. It paves the way to Guantanamo and Abu Grahib, and other situations where the US disregarded the Geneva Conventions. Well, there are Japanese soldiers today still unrepentent for the way they mistreated US POW's during the war. On a history channel documentary, one explains to the interviewer, as to why Japan did this, that ""This is war."" Now I am NOT saying the US infractions are nearly as bad as that of WWII Japan's. Japan's were 10,000 times worse. But this is the reductio as absurdum that the ideology of Ryan lead to. That said, i've watched the climax about 1000 times, and it  ranks as my 2nd favorite war film (Platoon's my favorite)."	3.0	guantanamo propaganda (but still good movie)	2009-07-06	23	2	21

Both movies should be viewed to understand D-Day.  The Longest  Day used, as advisors, actual participants during D-Day to accurately  portray the landing and subsequent activity.  Saving Private Ryan adds to  actual participants, the more than able assistance of historian Stephen  Ambrose to add accuracy to the film.  This is an important film both  historically and socially.

"...and that is saying alot in consideration of many memorable and excellent films that have been produced in this genre.There is no doubt that this movie is violent - but unlike some other producers that are interested in putting some sort of liberalized ""softball"" flick out there, Spielberg is a genius.  He gives it to you exactly as it was and as it should be portrayed.War is not pretty, and this film is not pretty.  That isn't the point or the thrust of the film.  War can be and is hell, but what type of men and women are these that put on the uniform and are willing to make the sacrifices that so many Americans don't have the guts for?  What type of Americans did we have during that crucial time in world history?  These are the Americans that Tom Brokaw outlined in his excellent book, ""The Greatest Generation.""  No intelligent person would disagree that this was America's greatest generation - our grandpas and grandmothers that silently go about their business now, and the same people who had to endure and WIN one of our planets greatest struggles.After seeing this film, you will not think about your WWII veteran grandparents the same way.  I read some reviews criticizing this films overtly American perspective.  Sorry, but you all desperately need to buy a clue... this is an American film made by a patriotic and very American director about American soldiers.  If you can't get with the program, ""Das Boot,"" ""Mein Kampf"" and Marx's ""Communist Manifesto"" is waiting for you.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1Q6XQYEPIZ8MZ	journeyman	I am a Vietnam vet, a 35-year reservist on active duty in Saudi Arabia, and a college professor who teaches a course on the theory and practice of war. The film blew me away when I saw it on a Saturday afternoon with my  wife. We didn't talk for awhile afterwards, just held hands very tightly. I  will show the first part of the film to my class on war, after they have  read Fussell's excerpts from his WARTIME in the Atlantic Monthly. Then they  will reflect on military ethics under such circumstances--Can we expect  people act &quot;morally&quot; in such conditions and hold them accountable  if they don't?My dad and uncle fought in the Pacific in WWII.  Their  stories and my own brief encounters with combat conditions confirm the  basic realism of the scenes Spielberg shot.Are there inaccuracies in  this film?  Yes.  Is it  PC (no blacks, German stereotyping, where were the  Brits, etc., etc.) No.  But the majority of people I have read here making  such comments are twits.  The horror of war eats up all its participants.  The individual stories of most participants caught up in real wars are  tragically mundane and pathetically &quot;undeveloped.&quot; (Trying to  make an &quot;interesting&quot; story out all the ordinary persons caught  up in this sort of thing is a travesty).So Spielberg tells a simple story  about ordinary lives smashed at random (or saved at random).  What he  ultimately accomplishes is to force us into alot of soul searching (at  least those of us morally awake) about when and why we should continue to  make war, about who we are and what we owe to our parents and grandparents,  about whether we are willing to put ourselves or others through this, and  if we have anything worth calling up such sacrifice to save.I guarantee  that neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iranian ayotollahs want their people  watching this and asking these sorts of questions. . .As to why this did  not win BEST PICTURE? Because the Hollywood liberals did not want to raise  questions about those who ran from sacrifice in recent history or to  encourage pandering to patriotism? Who knows. Why not skip serious  questions and award the title to a &quot;really interesting story&quot;  about Shakespeare in adulterous love.	5.0	Sobering reflection on War	1999-11-23	59	46	13
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1SWLMVKYOL09I	"""joycean2"""	"Excellent war movies depend on the taut requirements of realism.  Often a tool of that realism is a license for psychological theatrics: because war is chaos, the characters carry the chaos and destroy themselves.  Vietnam movies are the natural examples.  We have the sweltering, sinister jungle and a phantom enemy: we get the ruminating dialogue of the insane.  Sometimes this is realism.  Other times, though, I feel a director is using war as a forum for existential exercise.Spielberg, I think, rightly goes the other way.  The first violent scene is more ""visual"" than psychological.  And the men storming the beach are not immediately converted into a preaching symbol.  We do not bring up the words ""madness"" or ""hell"" or explain.  The brave implication is this: there is a kind of better comprehension in looking."	5.0	Straight Mirror (Edited Review)	1999-11-06	1	1	0

Then, a few moments later (same  scene) he dosen't.  Then, later on, as he is running toward the seawall, he  has it again.  When, where did he drop/pick-up his or another Thompson?  More examples of lack of contunity is when the squad arrives in the town  were Jackson takes out the sniper (great scene) Ophiem has no rifle and is  so scared that he is to be a part of Sgt. Mike's underwear. The next scene  has Ophiem with a rifle asking where the Captain is from, and showing very  little fear for a non-combatant soldier.  This scene seemed to be out of  sequence from the scenes before and after it.  There's more, but I will  jump ahead to the bridge battle. What struck me strange the most about this  battle was when Sgt. Mike grabbed Ophiem from the stair and said &quot;Time  to go to the Alamo&quot;.  The next scens shows Sgt. Mike telling Tom Hanks  to give him the Bazooka and get going to the Alamo.  Next, you see Ophiem  in a artillery crater.  What happen here?  Did Ophiem jump, fall, trip or  what to end up in this crater?  Where was Sgt. Mike when this happen?  How,  what, why did they get seperated?  Don't get me wrong I love this movie and  have a copy of it to show I do, but come on now!  If Steven needs a  Continuity director to help him with scene and equipment specifications  from cut to cut or scene to scene I will be more than happy to lend a  helping hand.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1LP6O85Z894GT	"J. Remington ""John Remington"""	"What follows is the review originally written for the local newspaper in 1998. On DVD the film still holds a great and lasting power.War is a wasteful, hungry, evil, immoral and  all consuming machine driven by young men who simply want to finish their job and get home. It is not something to be glamorized (The GI JOE dolls), trivialized (the plastic M16's and Tommy Guns at Wal-Mart) celebrated (any number of combat potboilers) or forgotten (a few ignorant highschoolers  refusing  to stand during the  national anthem).Although I never served in the armed forces or experienced combat, I hold the utmost respect and honor for the men and women who fought and paid the price for my freedom. I write that because it would sound most arrogant and self centered for me to say that because I have watched this film and read several World War II history books that I have experienced and therefore understand combat. I don't and pray I never will (or anyone else).In a film filled with haunting and searing images, one particular stands out. In the present day, an aged veteran, staring at the white gravestones, crumples in tears at Normandy Memorial Cemetery. Spielberg allows us to rediscover that these pillars of marble were once breathing young men filled with hopes, aspirations, talents, flaws and fears. All lost in an instant.Behind the veteran stand his children and grandchildren. The sacrifice he and his fellow soldiers made allowed his family to gain. His life is their (and our) legacy. Spielberg's purpose then as a film maker becomes clear. He will attempt to show the lives of the men now laying beneath the ground. It is an image I will not soon forget.Like all good art, and this film is a very fine example, Saving Private Ryan evolves into something other than mere entertainment. It grabs the viewer by the heart and refuses to let go. It forces one to feel, contemplate, experience and remember. As it unfolds on the screen, the story becomes not only a cultural event but also a lesson in the grand extremes of human character.  Spielberg shows us the best and the worst man has to offer.The story focuses on a small outfit led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) that is sent into the ravaged countryside to find the only surviving Ryan boy (three others have been killed). If they find the young man alive, he will get to return to his Iowa farm.War corespondent Morley Safer has said that he defines courage as ""not what we do for ourselves but rather what we do for others."" That description well serves the actions of Captain Miller and his men as well as those of PVT. James Ryan. They place their job and their ultimate task (winning the war) as their goal. Many times in the film they are faced with choices that could easily allow them escape, and almost always they defer to the ""bigger picture"". These men depend on each other for survival. If they  focus  only  on self, they  will  all lose. Yes, they do a number of unsavory  things  (the  incident with the  German  POW just one example), but they are all too real as I've  heard  many such instances  from my grandfathers.Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski compose the film like a Robert Capa photograph: violent, immediate and personal. With it's washed out colors and hand held shots, the film  has the feel of a combat news reel.Spielberg shows maturity as a filmmaker by muting John Williams' score. The characteristic fanfares and swelling marches are noticeably absent. The explosions, screams and ever-present rain serve as fitting soundtrack enough.Unlike the cartoonish Lethal Weapon series, the slick James Bond films, the muscle-headed Rambo-fests, the Bruckheimer noise-assaults, Saving Private Ryan's violence is hap-hazard, clumsy, and ugly. There is nothing clean about combat. Bodies are ripped open, faces shot off and appendages torn. Frequently one looks his enemy in the eye as he kills him. Quite often, violence in films is used as a vehicle to stimulate the adrenaline glands enough to make an audience cheer and applaud. This film's battle scenes inspired me to hide and avert my eyes.  The auditorium watched in a tense and tearful silence.Because of the battle scenes, Spielberg himself has forbidden his children from watching it. I agree.  In a great paradox, everyone should see this film, but it isn't for everyone.  Recent articles have hinted that the film almost received an NC-17 rating. I can't imagine a decent war film without such a rating.The American every man cast is centered around the near perfect performance of Tom Hanks. Like the men in my family who fought, he (and his fellow actors) are not movie star perfect with Adonis-like bodies performing superhuman tasks. Hanks is slightly paunchy, handsomely homely,  haggard, shaking with a  fearful  palsy and often near tears. And yet despite all these all too human traits, he bravely leads his men.This is simply not a film to be missed. It certainly is the best film of the year as well as one of the finest films ever made. It is a film to be remembered and celebrated.In a way I suppose it is sad that it takes a piece of popular entertainment to force us into remembering history.  As if the stories of the relatives, the pledge of allegiance and the national cemeteries weren't enough. This film proves it isn't the format that counts, it's the remembrance and respect.Shame on us if we forget the terrible sacrifice made on those few days of June 1944, shame on us if we forget why that sacrifice was made, and shame on us if we allow it all to happen again."	5.0	A work of art.	2003-07-16	5	3	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A37H60O85IF8OP	J. Stevens	"Mr. Spielberg clearly does not know what he is talking about. He acts as if he does, and the result is disastrous. The Normandy beach landings in the movie were historically inaccurate. The American shooting of prisoners are lauded as heroic and justified, and the German atrocities are given an evil tone. The script is hilariously bad, the actors can't act, and the result is a movie that is visually appealing to the uninformed- the people Spielberg likes to manipulate. It's is full of American flag-waving patriotic garbage, and it's not a coincidence that Spielberg (a Jew) is very anti-German. I'm not saying what the Nazis did was wrong, but Spielberg should not let personal feelings get in the way of making a historical movie.The most obvious mistake is that during the last battle scene, the Germans rarely, if ever, shoot back. According to Captain Miller, these were men of the 2nd SS Panzer Division ""Das Reich"", which were some of the most skilled soldiers of WWII. They would definitely shoot back. The Americans also killed at least 200 of the Germans, not the 50 reported by the sniper.Other than that, the movie is one of the goriest I have ever seen. Most of it is gratuitous and unneccessary, but, as Americans, we tend to like that kind of stuff."	2.0	Fake	2003-07-07	10	5	5

Today it's all about action movies and it's easy to get caught up in the shoot em' up action flick and forget that wars and death happened and still do today.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1IXYJ7MR4ORQH	"J. Urban ""urbanbooks"""	"This is a mediocre war movie at best. Yes, it has excellent special effects and I admit it set a new standard for Hollywood when it comes to ""combat cinematography"" - these same special effects techniques were used in Band of Brothers and Pearl Harbor and they are the best I've seen to date in a Hollywood movie.However, that is all this film has going for it.  When it premiered people were in ""shock and awe"" of the graphic depiction of warfare.  Yes, warfare is ugly, brutal, and shocking.  But simply splattering soldiers' guts across the scene doesn't make a great movie.  Great movies require good plots, great writing, and believable characters and situation.  This movie has none of these.I would first like to briefly state that this film actually does an injustice to the men who fought at Omaha by making their advance seem easier than it was.  Yes, the film depicts many men dying horrible deaths on the beach.  However, the real battle for Omaha was a day long ordeal.  This film makes it appear that the men landed, blew a hole in some wire, shot a few men manning machine guns, then moved off the beach and cleared the cliffs beyond.  Yes, it showed a lot of men dying in the process, but the process feels as though it took minutes, not all day.  The film The Longest Day did a much better job of creating the illusion of expansion of time despite being made nearly 60 years before this film. This film simply sought to shock its audience with a lot of gore like a horror movie, not portray the prolonged and brutal struggle endured by the men on that beach that day.Furthermore, the plot is simply ludicrous.  The US Army would not blindly send six men plus a Captain traipsing though hundreds of miles of enemy held territory just in the off-chance that they might come across one man in particular.  In war, such ""luxuries"" don't exist.As a Captain, Tom Hanks' character would be a company commander, responsible for at least two platoons and far too busy to be assigned to such a capricious task with only five other men.Speaking of the men, how these motley soldiers ever make it through boot camp?  They're constantly bickering with their Captain - clearly a superior officer who would NOT be taking any guff from a private - especially in the field in a combat situation.  This begs the question how the ""school teacher"" ever reached the rank of Captain in the first place.  Never in this film does he show any effective leadership skills nor does he demonstrate conviction of his decisions.  In one scene he has to be rescued by his sergeant as his men are all at each others throats, yelling at each other, and causing much panic and chaos.  No officer, let alone a Captain, would ever let a situation deteriorate to the point that it does in this film.Regarding the German prisoner they released that many claim to have returned at the end.  The solider released after the combat at the radar site was regular army - Deutsche Wehrmacht.  Those solders fighting in the town at the end are SS.  While lay people may not know the difference, there is a major difference.  Some say he was ""pressed into service"" by the SS.  Even if that were so, they certainly wouldn't have issued him a new uniform in the day or two that elapsed between his release and the town battle.  One does not have the luxury of getting a fresh change of clothes in the middle of an ongoing battle.  These were two different men.Oh, and about the battle at the end, the fiction employed for the sake of Hollywood is laughable.  During this battle some men are bashing mortar shells on the ground and then throwing them like grenades. Mortar shells are not armed by simply jarring them.  If that were true it would be impossible to transport them safely.  They are armed by an arming pin at the base of the mortar tube into which they are dropped.  It's the same mechanism that causes the powder charge to explode that propels the shell out of the tube.  The pin fits up the center of the base of the mortar round  - a rock won't do it.  Even if we say it could, the act of hitting the round on the ground would then cause the propellant charge to ignite, forcing the round out of the hand of the person ""whacking"" it.  This entire concept of this as depicted in this film is preposterous.There are so many other issues with this film that there isn't room to cover them all - from poorly written dialog, to technical inaccuracies, to forgettable characters and implausible situations.  Those already presented give a good idea of the flaws in this film.If you just want to watch a movie to be ""shocked and awed"" by eye candy, I can see this film being entertaining.  But if you're looking for an enduring, believable war story with memorable characters you need to look elsewhere. Those who enjoy this film will probably enjoy U-571 as well."	2.0	Great Special Effects But Unrealistic With A Poor Plot	2005-01-11	78	38	40

I saw this movie to kill some time before I could go to a party. I cried so much at the end that I used up all the tissue. I think about the solders every day  now that I have seen this movie. My friends know me as the war freak. No  offense to modern teenagers, but most of them couldn't give a great big  sh#* about the sacrificing of the veterns in this war. This movie is a  great movie to show teenagers what war is like. The first thirty minutes is  hell. The plot-line fits right into it. The character development is great.  The F/X are the best I have seen in all my life. If you want a great war  movie to show you what war was like, I strongly suggest this masterpiece of  Speilberg's adding to his hundreds of other masterpieces. Worth every  dollar.

I love this movie and when tell people that they  seem to think that all I like it for is the blood and gore.  But this movie  is about all the pain and suffering that people and families had to endure  for our freedom.  Another reason that I love this movie is because it  really shows how hard war is on people and soldiers especially.  Also I'm a  kid and so I've spent a fair amount of time playing guns and war but this  film really made me think.  Bottom line this movie is great.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan	2000-05-20	4	3	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A11EVU318FTW32	J. Weese	Interestingly enough, the reviews that dock this movie stars are written by men and women who have never served in battle complaining about bad plot development, or one-sided story telling, or just another fuzzy Speilberg  film.  Funny however, is the fact that I have heard no World War II  veterans or even war veterans in general complain about this film's  realism, that is because this film does an excellent job of depicting what  war was like for the average soldier. Saving Private Ryan put to motion  many of the bloody accounts I have been reading since I was a 7th grader  about World War II. Reading or hearing about a shell landing several feet  away and blasting a soldier with his buddy's brains is one thing, but  actually seeing it makes one realize just exactly how bad war is. The story  was good too and touched me so much that I thanked a Korean vet for his  service to our country. After a minute or two of silence to choke back  tears, he thanked me and told me Saving Private Ryan was so real that when  the first shots were fired in the movie, he wanted to duck for fear that  the North Koreans were once again firing on him. He then told me about his  experiences during the Korean War which was enlightening and something I  will remember for a long time. This is an excellent movie and instead  complaining about its inadequaces people should go to their local veterans  center and thank those men who reside there for their willingness to die so  that we may be free. Or, are we too busy  complaining about so-called bad  movies?	5.0	What it was like.	2000-01-10	8	4	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3IRIDKJ9LNJRG	J. Wong	This is a fine WWII movie that shows the bravery of American soldiers in the face of so much horror, chaos, and hardship of war. World War II was hell, but it was a necessary hell in which decent people were forced to give up some part of their humanity in order to stop an enemy that was really determined to wipe out the free world. This film is about showing respect to those who risk their lives in order to make this a better and more peaceful world.The middle part of the movie is a little bit weak and overlong; I do believe the director and screenwriters could have done a better job with that part of the movie.The movie does show how unpredictable, chaotic, and dangerous warfare is, and how the GREATEST award for any soldier is trying to survive all of that. For those people who criticize that this movie is not always 100% accurate, please keep in mind this is a fictional WWII movie; it is NOT suppose to be a documentary about D-DAY or how soldiers fight in a war.P.S.For those who still doubt the plausibility of some of the movie's events, you may want to look at Stephen Ambrose's books BAND OF BROTHERS (US 101st Airborne Unit), D-DAY JUNE 6, 1944 (interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans of D-DAY) and his other books. Some of the movie's events were taken from these books.And for those who believe the movie's ending is implausible, you can read the book  STEEL INFERNO (written by Michael Reynolds, a retired British officer who is an expert on German panzer tactics) on pages 130-131, Chapter 11, it tells about an incident that took place at Villers-Bocage, France (6/13/1944) that is ALMOST similar to what see in the movie ending.	4.0	A great tribute and monument to American WWII veterans	2002-09-28	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3LORBC2O008CY	"J. Youmans ""4Jays"""	I am not one who normally sees the same movie over and over.  However, I am not ashamed to admit I have seen SPR more than 15 times, including 3 times at the theater.  This movie affected me partly because my dad served  in WW2 and both my parents were the same age as those who served our  country during that time.  Indeed, many of my parents' high school friends  went to war and never returned.  This movie doesn't pull any punches and it  is better for it.  I recently made a significant upgrade to my home theater  setup including a multi-channel Klipsch speaker system with powered  subwoofer, etc.  I spent the extra money for the much-touted DVD/DTS  version of this movie, even though I already have it on VHS.  I was not  prepared for the astounding difference in sound quality, even between dolby  digital surround and DTS.  The DTS version literally recreates the movie  theater experience (with the right equipment).  Your DVD player and  receiver/amp must have a built-in DTS decoder (I recommend you look at the  Toshiba 3109 DVD player) to play back in this format.  I was able to watch  the movie yet again as if it were for the first time because the auditory  experience was so intense.  If you are DTS-ready do not even think of  buying any other version of DVDs.  I found you can find all the DTS DVDs at  amazon.com simply by entering DTS in the search window.

It shows you that to be a ""hero"" you must brutally murder others who are in the same awful position as you.  I know that this view is unpopular, but I couldn't care less.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3BO9FLATQULV5	K. A. Jones	"I picked up the Sapphire BR SPR a month ago and finally got around to watching & hearing it. First I still have the DVD DTS version so I was currious as to the upgrade in the video but also how the two audio tracks compared; DTS vs DTS-HD.The video transfer is an excellent upgrade over the DVD though it still retains some of that so-called documentry grainess in some areas as it was intended. The colors are as they should be in the pallete of War....greens, browns, greys, blacks and yes red. It's going to make you say...Wow in the sense like seeing Monsters,Inc or Avatar. But the details throughout in uniforms, buildings, people, weapons brings the realism of war closer than ever. Probably too close especially in the famous ""Beach Scene"" where the reality of what rel war probably was with body parts flying and exposed.The audio portion didn't disappoint and frankly will rock your house and senses. There are many forums and topics that are always asking,""What Blu-ray to show off your HT"" and about every poll and answer will have Saving Private Ryan on that list.Even when it came out on DVD with the DTS format it was considered one of if not the best sounding movie to make use of you HT sound. The new DTS-HD track does deliver a more fuller and open sound than the normal DTS track which is no slouch itself. To me it was like comparing D.D 5.1 to DTS 7.1. I felt I could detect just more sounds in the lower and higher fequencies with just better details. The first 20-25 minutes of the movie is a must for audio fans.The movie itself is flat out good but it's no typical war movie like Patton, Battle of the Buldge, Tora-Tora-Tora or Midway. While those were of historical happenings they didn't deal with the real brutality and emotions of what War can bring. In Saving Private Ryan you see and feel it and it hits you squarely between the eyes. If no-one comes away with some gut check, heart wrentching, or a slight tear in the first 25 minutes of this movie they're either dead or comatose.Tom Hanks as Capt. John Miller, is given orders to go deep and locate one Private Ryan and bring him back when it's learned three of his brothers were all killed in one week. During their mission they encounter others caught up with war itself, the uncertainity and just trying to survive. They lose a few of their own while seeing the effects on both soldiers and cilvans. While the Beach Scene is as emotional as you can see the one with Wade the medic getting shot is just gut wrentching. Laying bleeding from several bullets the entire groupsitting around Wade, is scrabbling to plug the holes and stop the blood flow while asking Wade for directions on what to do. You can sense their hope fading and helplessness as their friend crys out for his Moma and doesn't want to die for several minutes which seems longer.They finally find someone who knows Ryan and about where he is. After locating Ryan and giving him the news they expect he'll follow but Ryan refuses saying he has orders to protect one of two bridges left and his current platton buddies are now ""his only brothers"". Facing lack of ammo, soldiers and against all odds, Miller (Hanks) takes control and decides on protecting the bridge. The ensuing Last Stand of the Alamo type battle in the town is close and brutal with several losing their lives in the process. Miller, always keeping Ryan out of harms way is shot while trying to retrive the detonator for the bridge. At the last minute everyone is saved by a pair of P-51's along with reinforcements. Hanks wound is fatal but not before telling Ryan,""earn this...Earn It"". As the film returns as it did in the beginning the older Ryan asks his wife has he led a good life and been a good man while standing in front of Capt. Millers tombstone.It's hard to imagine those saying anything bad about this movie are calling it ""over-rated"". They probably have a negative outlook on anything military and war itself as it's a waste of money first and lives second. While it was a movie veterans praised the film as the most realastic depiction of war especially the Normandy landing. Truely they were America's Best Generation but so sad todays doesn't appreciate them or their sacrifice."	5.0	A must for anyones collection...	2012-05-18	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: One of the greatest war films ever made finally has a little justice on DVD. Steven Spielberg loves WWII, he is really fascinated with it. Saving Private Ryan is the true story of a group of men risking their lives for one. Really people see this movie being about the horrors of war but in truth its about finding decency within this war. The movie really spends most of its time focusing on the character of Captain Miller and his journey to find himself. Spielberg even mentions this in the ""making of"". What this movie has done really well are the editing and the camera work. When combined we have a very genuine feel to the movie and not something churned out by Hollywood such as Windtalkers. The movie also deals with the issues of teamwork and brotherhoods. War is a very unique in that soldiers go into it wanting to fire big guns but in the midst of it they realize more about themselves then ever before, and this movie demonstrates that very well. The opening D-Day scene is intense and probably one of the best edited scenes of all time. Not only will Saving Private Ryan show you the horrors of war like any other war film could, but it will show you how men learn about themselves and human nature within it.VIDEO: Excellent transfer with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The picture is very sharp and very clear as it should be.AUDIO: No DTS, but a top of the line Dolby 5.1. Excellent sound for a movie that won one of its Oscars for sound.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I love the packaging of this set. It is modeled after an ammo cartridge box used in the war. It's made of very hard cardboard and is very sturdy. The case opens like a box, not like a book. One disc sits in the door of the box and the other is sitting in the bed of it. Very unique. As for extras, there is just enough to make you buy this set, but nothing to go crazy over. The first release was almost stripped bare except for trailers and an interview with Spielberg, but at least here we have a decent look into the movie. The featurettes are very basic actually, just focusing on how Spielberg came to direct the film, the history of the war, the characters, the D-Day scene, a boot camp featurette, sound, and a few others. I'm glad that this set just didn't talk about history and stuff like that and actually looked into the making of the film itself. At least it was better than Schindler's List in terms of extras. I wish they had the trailers on the set though so if I want to watch them I don't have to get out my old set. Overall they just put enough to get the grade, nothing above and beyond.Movie Score: (5 Stars / 5 Stars)DVD Score: (8 / 10)"	5.0	A Better DVD Release For An Excellent Film	2004-05-26	4	3	1

Not because of the action, but because of the glorification of such a horrible subject. But of course, win or lose, war is a terrible thing. Saving Private Ryan, although shown mainly from the americans perspective, does not glamorize war, yet still manages to come through as one of the greatest war movies of all time. The thing that I found really good about this movie was that the characters were realistically patriotic, not suicidal. If you are very knowledgable about WWII, then you may notice slightly inexact components such as the war planes at at the end of the movie. But overall, it is an excellently directed and produced war film with good character depth and a great plot.	5.0	Spielberg at his best	2001-08-24	2	2	0

It begins with the D-Day battle of Omarha beach. This is a brilliant opening scene which lasts for around half an hour. The Americans are all in boats and have to make their way up a beach which is protected by a German machine gun. The allies just get slautered. I don't want to give too much away coz it's a great scene.Anyway a special mission ensues to save Private Ryan - I can't give anything else away coz it will spoil the film.Just trust me, I have it on video and it is amazing - it's more than amazing.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AI4JWVX2MXKL6	"Kelly S. Larue ""Kelly"""	&#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; brings the war home to you like few films do.  It doesn't seem to be in Spielberg's DNA to produce a clunker (We don't discuss 1941 in polite company) and he has delivered another winner.  Tom Hanks is, as always, completely believable in whatever role he takes on and he is in this one too.  This little Band of Brothers become your band of brothers and you hope they succeed in their quest with all your heart.  After a little black comedy it looks like everything is going to work out until a monkey wrench is thrown into the works.  Some people criticized the film's beginning as overly sentimental and I see their point but the film as a whole is breathtaking.  One lesson in the movie, there is no place for mercy in a war.  Watch for the proof of this statement.	5.0	War really is Hell	2013-12-18	1	0	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3P8BT2RUTWVF	Kelvin Wee	Well I've heard it all, how the movie was over-rated and how it was hyped up more than it deserved.  And how the plot and story was too dismal and didn't really come together all that well.  But the movie has to be appreciated for what it was.........a 'masterpiece' and would undoubtedly set a standard that other war movies have to match!  We're already seeing the homage to SPR........Enemy at the Gates, Pearl Harbour, The Thin Red Line and I'm sure more to come!  SPR was unbelievably real!  The sound effects of richocheting bullets off metal, bricks and rock doesn't get to be anymore realistic!  I was sitting next to a war veteran at the movies and the sound just took him right back to his war!  He relived his experience again!  That takes skill and vision!!  The action scenes were authentic and graphic like never before!!  I'll always remember how the German soldiers fell after being shot, they fell as they would if they were really shot!  The horrifying scenes on the Normandy beaches of soldiers praying and the fear they exhibited.  All in all, it gave us an extremely realistic look at WW2.  It doesn't get any better than that, except on a documentary with live footage!  If the plot isn't up to some standards, well its Hollywood!!  Everything's been covered at least once by now.  SPR should be aclaimed for its realism, not the plot which was marginal at worst!  Otherwise the film held together very well!!	4.0	As close to WW2 as you're gonna get!!	2001-07-01	2	2	0

I didn't think they were serious, so I went to go see it.  I'll have to say that I was blown away.  It didn't really give you alot of time to settle in.  One minute you're seeing an old man reminiscing, next minute you're on Omaha Beach.Anyways, the camera work during the Omaha Beach segment gave the impression of actually being there.  Especially with the jittery motion and the bits of breathing that you hear in the background.The DVD was a very good transfer although I wish I had gotten the DTS version instead.

There is s lot of truth in this movie, not only about Doomsday but the Niland family(almost same story of the Ryan's) and the Sullivan brothers(the reason for the sole survivor rule). A great piece of history. A great story told about the Sole Survivor Rule of the military, that allows the last of a generation to be protected.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AKA58N330RL70	"Kenneth J. Handley ""book lover"""	If it was possible to rate this movie a 10 it would still not do it justice. This Spielberg masterpiece takes the filmgoer on a journey that the ordinary man in the street, if he is fortunate, never gets to experience. It vividly shows both through the brilliant cinematograhy and the equally briliant acting the brutality of war and the great price paid by many both directly and indirectly involved. War ultimately has no winners only survivors and this movie demonstrates that in spades. It shows warfare in its most basic and brutal form something man was not created to witness but foisted on many for reasons beyond their control.Hanks is at his best in this movie and gives a tradesmanlike performance which we have become accustomed to seeing from this actor. Sizemore gives us another look at his considerable talent and is a good foil to Hanks throughout the film. I personally feel it is the directing that this film will chiefly be remembered for and the powerful message it conveys rather than the acting which is not to downplay the acting in any way. I doubt we will see better from Spielberg although this directors ability to surprise is well documented. Small wonder that many veterans of the Normandy landings broke down when viewing the opening scenes of this movie such was the realism portrayed. I myself had been in the cemetary overlooking Omaha beach 6 months after the filming of the opening scenes so the movie has a very special personal meaning for me. When one looks over the hundreds of white headstones the overwhelming feeling of debt engulfs one. Many of the soldiers who gave thier lives in the landings were mere teenagers. Its hard to accept but they and thousands of others saved what was then the free world. The movie captures this aspect brilliantly. There are not sufficient superlatives to accord this masterpiece.	5.0	The ultimate war movie in every respect.	2005-06-25	4	3	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2FLOSAEOE6Z8G	Kenneth P. Harvey	One of the best American films of the past few years (the embarassment of the film community when the puerile &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; won best picture last year was palpable) this movie reminds us all that a hero  is simply an ordinary person in an extradinary situation--and that it is to  these Average Joes that we owe everything.So much has been said about  this great movie that I won't go into much more detail, except to point out  that the previous reviewer makes a couple of mistakes.  First, the movie  makes it clear that most of Captian Miller's men DON'T make it off the  beach...the ones who go on the patrol with him are simply some of the  survivors. Miller even says 'is this all that have made it?' at one point  during the landing sequence.  Second, regarding Ryan's children as looking  too young, the 'modern' private Ryan is obviously about 75 years old (i.e.,  he would have been about 21 in 1944) and his children look to be in their  forties...the youngsters referred to in the review are certainly Ryan's  grandchildren.  The 'typical' WWII vet made the most of his opportunities,  went to college on the GI bill, and probably wouldn't have started a family  until his 30s.  The numbers work for me.	5.0	A great film with a great message	2000-05-22	8	4	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3OQV8OX2SQ08H	"Kent Beuchert ""thebike"""	Those who have studied the Neptune landings at Omaha Beachwill feel cheated and insulted by Spielberg's portrayal ofthe Omaha landings. No one leaving the theater after seeing this film will be any the smarter about the event. Although the scenes of Miller and his small Ranger company (68 men), as aportrayal of companies A &amp; B at Dog Green may pass a lax musteras accurate, the general image of their experiences as typicalfor those at Omaha during the first 90 minutes (0630-0800) arecompletely false. The casualty rate for the period (by far theworst that day at Omaha) were approx 11 1/2 percent, far fewerthan one one asume from watching Pvt Ryan. In fact, the entire 5th Ranger Battalion (under Col Schneider) landed but a 100-150yards east of Miller's group and took but 1 percent woundedmoving to the shingle and to the top of the cliffs. The troops at Omaha , except for Miller's group (who moved west) WALKEDup the slopes to the bluffs - cliffs were only present at the extremeties of the 4.5 mile long landing area, and were not scheduled for assault.  The remainder of the movie has a totallyillogical plot, whereby troops (Miller) from Omaha beach are sent to move thru German lines to contact a kid inthe 101st.Aside from the unliklihood of such a strategy actually working,the fact was that the 4th Division at Utah Beach was in contact with the 101st from day 1. Historically, this film is a totaldistortion of the Omaha Beach landings and introduces an unintentionally hilarius crackpot scheme to get Miller into more heroic action. Totally transparent. Totally nonsensical.	1.0	Bad history, unintentially hilarious plot	2003-11-25	48	14	34
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ADTNEA3LH0KXJ	Ken Zowal	I've read hundreds of movie reviews over the years, but I just read the best of the best: Doug Thomas' short, direct essay on Saving Private Ryan.  Here's why: First, he helped me finally understand why Spielberg started the movie with the graveyard-at-Normandy scene.  Knowing about the director's first home movie reveals to me something of the director as a human being.Second, the word kinetic says so much about why the characters acted as they did, some would say stereotypically -- because there are rare times when events hurl YOU in directions you never wanted, or even dreamed you'd go, in your fiercest nightmare. There, trying to be yourself is a dangerous and very painful exercise.  Witness the future of the interpreter after his performance in the field.Third, this film so eloquently demonstrated what a thousand Memorial Day speeches could never say: that as a nation of individuals, we, individually, owe so very much to both those who fought and those who died, to help slay the most hideous monster that threatened our collective existence in a hundred generations.  And Doug said it so simply -- how we SHOULD feel about the past and this event.When one reads the complete history of that war, one wishes that a film like Saving Private Ryan could be made about a people who overwhelmingly suffered the most casualties, killed the most Germans, and pushed the monster back 2,200 miles into its hell hole and killed it -- the Russians.  When that film is made I think we will truly understand how we should feel about that unfortunate, misunderstood nation.  If the Russians seem they feel unappreciated by Americans, it is because they are.  When I left the theater after viewing this film, it took me several days to work through all the emotions of fear, pain, loss, disgust, and especially helplessness in the face of overwhelming disaster and imminent death, that no other film before or since has stirred inside me.  Because of this, I feel Saving Private Ryan, as a cinematic work of art, is in a class by itself.I've wanted to say this for a very long time.  I finally found the right place to say it.	5.0	Best Review: Doug's	2001-03-28	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3CB3UJ7NHTQAQ	Kevin Bush (kjb3477@aol.com)	There are those who look at a film with the upmost scrutiny (much like someone at this site) and tear it apart if it doesn't match history with perfection.  True, there are elements that Spielburg didn't replicate  exactly, but the film still one of the greatest ever made.  What was  replicated perfectly were the important elements of heroism, sacrifice,  compassion, and the enduring human spirit.  You can't view this movie from  the approach that everything has to be identical to history.  This movie  was an attempt to put into perspective the sacrifices others have made for  the United States so future generations could have the right to make movies  on whatever they choose to, and so others could criticize it without fear  of reprisal from their government.  I think that Steven Spielburg  succeeded.	5.0	Simply brilliant	1999-10-20	1	1	0

How wrong I was, how wrong I was......The opening  twenty minutes of this film has finally done what so many people have tried  to do in the past, be it your parents or grandparents.  It has made me  finally realise what these ordinary people did.  What they gave up just so  I could sit here now and type about it.Here we go I hear you say.  Another one that's going to break into a long winded essay on how it  changed their life.  Well I'm not.  I'm gonna keep it short.This film  needed to be made.  It needs to be watched by everyone who wasn't there and  never had to experience those horrific things.  Why?Because I now put  a name to people I just regarded as soldiers.  I realise now that these  were people just like me and you and they didn't want to be there, but they  were and they did all this for us.This film needs to be watched by  ALL!	5.0	Thank You!	2000-04-30	5	4	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1RP5OZAAG7S3B	Kevin Pickett	This movie really gives you a sense of what WWII was like. The opening scene was brilliant, same as the shell shock scene at the end. However, it would have been much better without the arguments between the soldiers, i think that if they had created a better topic of dialogue, this movie would easily be a 5 star film. However, i do not want to trash the dialogue fully. The conversation between the captain and the sergeant while the rest of their squad is sleeping inside is really great. I felt as if what they were talking about was the most important thing in the world, and i was hooked on every word. I also did not like vin diesel.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	The US government orders a group of soldiers to venture into enemy territory to find a lost comrade.  No, APOCALYPSE NOW it isn't.  The movie is less an anti-war statement than a rather banal testimonial of US war efforts, complete with sentimental speeches and a hackneyed, feel-good ending.  The movie does show the usual Spielberg technical prowess that is evident in the superb battle scenes, especially a stunning re-creation of the landing at Omaha beach.The movie is sold in 2 DVD editions: Dolby Digital, and DTS.  The Dolby Digital edition contains a making-of featurette that mentions a real-life WWII story in which 4 brothers fought and died in the war; the story obviously inspired the movie.  The featurette also shows wonderful, rarely-seen clips of films Spielberg made as a child.  The DTS edition does not include this featurette.	4.0	Typically Spielbergian	2001-04-17	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1KT1GWCW8F80	K. Gittins	&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is Director Steven Spielberg's acclaimed movie about finding the last surviving brother (one of four) who was part of the Normandy invasion of World War II. Steeped in sentimentallty as Spielberg movies often are, you do feel a genuine sympathy for the characters. There is no getting around the fact that it is a sad movie - as the designated mission accomplishes its goal at great cost.Perhaps most-notable for its intensely graphic 20-minute opening scene of ther assault of the beach, the movie raises some points about sacrificing for a cause and the standing up for your principles. The movie boasts an impressive cast including Tom Hanks as the captain leading Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, and Vin Diesel, among others, to find Matt Damon. For some of the members, it is just an assignment, for others it is a waste of time, for others it it a noble cause.The central third of the movie drags a bit, and I had a problem with one of the wimpy characters who almost screws up the mission. His character was a huge, obvious cliche.The DVD has good a good picture and sound. The extras include a short &quot;A special message from Steven Spielberg&quot; which is mostly an ad for the D-Day museum, and &quot;Into the Breach&quot;, a good behind the scenes featurette. Also included are cast/crew detail and a couple trailers.	4.0	&quot;We are going to get him the hell...out of there.&quot;	2004-05-31	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3SG59KJLAQOPG	K. Good	There's been so much hype and commentary generated about this film, most  pro and con commentary has been mentioned, so just some brief comments  here:The Omaha Beach scene, filled with mind-numbing violence, and  realistic disorientation, earns the film the credit I have given it.  One  may quibble about whether Capt. Miller would really have deliberately  exposed himself to a German MG just to draw fire... and there's no doubt  that the real WW2 trivia buffs would pick the entire film apart.But  really, my objection is that the rest of the story is too much of a  lengthy, schmaltzy cliche about &quot;the few sacrificing for the  one.&quot;  It tries way too hard to be (ultimately one-dimensionally)  inspirational, based solely on that single theme.  &quot;The Thin Red Line,  &quot; a somewhat flawed but better film, gives one much more philosophical  meat to chew on.Perhaps as a compensatory conceit, SPR does tend to  tone down the sophomoric morality a bit by slathering over the scenes with  slick and flashy violence.  And in the lately fashionable trend of sniping  at the Brits, they just couldn't resist the temptation to perpetuate the  anti-Monty myths with a toss-away derisive comment.Unlike many true  classics, this film gets more boring as you view it numerous times.  Nothing new is appreciated, but the triteness and pretension of the story  line become more pronounced.  In short, it looks a lot more impressive when  first viewed than when repeatedly examined.	2.0	Overrated, overlong	2000-09-06	14	8	6

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2BDJOIXPR2AYU	King of Controversy	I've heard it said Spielberg lacks subtlety but to me a Spielberg movie is an experience, as is Saving Private Ryan. It's never just about the drama and this one isn't just about war. I haven't seen half of the films Spielberg has directed, so I must have something to look forward to. I did watch his first film, Duel, on TV as a young adult, probably in it's debut. Perhaps that simple film, Duel, Was just about the action on screen. It was a good film. At least I, and a teenage buddy who was also watching the film, at his house, both liked the movie.A friend claims if you ever want a book made into a movie, Steven Spielberg will tell the exact tale written on paper. Perhaps capturing the spirit as well. He did a wonderful tribute to Stanley Kubrick in Artificial Intelligence. I wonder if we see more of Spielberg here in Saving Private Ryan?The most memorable scene to me is when an American GI is about to be stabbed to death by a German soldier. Alone in a hand to hand struggle with a German soldier, the American GI begins asking the German questions. It stood out to be because I recognized this, probably from my own childhood. The GI was asking questions, like children do, at least like I did, to try and delay the oncoming punishment, in this case, death. The German soldier himself seems to recognize this and talks to him in English like a child, however, when the German puts him to sleep he really puts him to sleep. To me, anyway, this drama was making a statement. When you punish a child, in a sense you are killing them. What better place to 'enlighten' us than a war movie? The lesson taught by war is that sacrifices must be made, even the ultimate sacrifice. War is hell. By comparison, the duty of work is expected to be relatively easy.When the scene is over, the German soldier walks out, away, and he's faced with another chance to kill American soldiers. Whether having proven himself or sorry for the murder he had to commit, he simply walks away. The killing is done for the day, and perhaps, hopefully, done. This scene kind of reminded me of a science fiction story I had read many years ago. In the SciFi story, after battles take place in space, the surviving ships, scavenging the ships they had just destroyed, wouldn't fire on the enemy survivors, not wanting to 'jeopardize their survivor status'. The story was named 'Boomer Boys on New Alabama'. Whether the story influenced this scene in Saving Private Ryan is questionable, although I think it likely Steven Spielberg has read this story.This film was just an experience from beginning to end. In my opinion it is a war movie you would want to watch.	5.0	An experience.	2013-01-19	0	0	0

As they travel through a German occupied area you reach out and feel the character of each individual person.

No film prior to this has ever more realistically and poignantly showed the true costs of war, without glorifying those costs.The premise:Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a Ranger Company Commander whose company is part of the D-Day invasion!  A major portion of his company is wiped out during the invasion on Omaha beach and a follow on action in which they had to take out a pair of German 88's.  He is then given the mission to find Private Ryan, who's three brothers who were all recently KIA (killed in action).  His company is effectively taken away from him, to be used to shore up losses in another company.  He takes seven of his best Rangers and sets off on the quest to find Private Ryan who jumped in with 101st Parachute Infantry Regiment the night before D-Day and bring him home safely.Special Features:An exclusive message from Steven Spielberg - which gives Academy Award winning Best Director an opportunity to display his admiration for America's ""Greatest Generation.""Saving Private Ryan - Into the Breach - which is a wonderful tribute to the men who fought the war and, in part, to those who brought this film to the silver screen.  {ssintrepid}"	5.0	Saving Private Ryan - &quot;Freedom is not free!&quot;	2003-01-01	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	APAX65NX3YDN7	"""laeric"""	If you like war movies, this movie is for YOU. It's one of the most realistic movie of war, that i've ever seen. The horrors and thrills of war are on your grasp, you can almost feel it. But beware, it's not for the  faint of heart. The DVD version comes with superb picture quality as  always, it shows that this dvd has really gotten some love in the making.  The sound is mixed in DD 5.1 and DD 2.0. The DD 5.1 track makes you're  neighbours very nervous, but that's the whole point. You can almost feel  the bullets swinging by you, the grenades exploding behind you and so  forth. If you don't have this movie yet, consider buying it. CONSIDER  REALLY HARD, BECAUSE IT'S WORTH BUYING.	5.0	To Normandy and back......	2000-06-07	5	3	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AP28EU980272X	Lakan Kildap	"If this doesn't convince them DVD is the state of the art, nothing will.  Get it in DTS and rent the Dolby version for the one extra supplement material that is missing on the DTS version.The movie itself isn't bad, it was the frontrunner in the Oscars until ""Shakespeare in Love"" came late riding on a wave of favorable reviews.  Strangely, ""Ryan"" still won every other Best Picture trophy to be given that year. (Kind of reminds me how Michelle Pffeiffer won almost every Best Actress award for ""Fabulous Baker Boys"" except the Oscar.)  It is one of the most realistic depictions of combat in movie history.  Perhaps only the Band of Brothers series, which came much later (HDTV and now DVD) can rival this movie when it comes to realism.The movie, IMO is about irony.  Forget the special effects for a while and concentrate on Edward Burns' line as he ponders the math: ""What's the use of risking the lives of eight of us for just one guy?""  The mission was FUBAR to begin with, a public relations job, as Dennis Farina says.  One bad decision, but so well executed by skilled professionals, no major foul-ups, so far, so good.  Then Tom Hanks decides to commit his entire squad against a machinegun nest he could have easily bypassed, or taken out with his sniper (who was extremely talented).  He loses his medic, of all people, a non-combatant.  He frees a surrenderee (the decent thing) and pays dearly for the kind deed.  He then impossibly allows himself to be talked by mission objective himself, Private Ryan, into making a desperate, predictably disastrous defense of a bridge against German armor.  You know the rest: when a handful of men without big guns take on a few tanks plus 50 enemy infantry, the results could only be disastrous, even if the said men were elite Rangers and 101st Airborne.I was so emotionally spent after watching this movie, I was inspired (if it can be called that) to imagine, many days later, a different ending for this movie.  At the risk of being called a spoiler (IMO, a lot of people have seen this anyway), here it is:  They extract Ryan indeed, and most of them make it back to the American lines.  OK?  Then, as they arrive at dusk, a nervous sentry mistakenly shoots Ryan dead.  Mission failed.  See if that doesn't break your heart.  Don't laugh, something like this happened in Band of Brothers, which is based on true stories of 101st Airborne men.  (OK the man shot didn't die.)OK, my 15 minutes is up.  Summary:  great movie, great DVD.  If you really must watch that extra supplement in the Dolby version, either rent that version (which I did) or buy it too.  But don't leave this DTS version out of your collection."	5.0	watch this with a buddy who has yet to upgrade to DVD/DTS	2003-02-15	4	3	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A19HY5RQMRCSEO	Lala Lucy	I think this was an overall great war movie. It is up there with &quot;The Longest day&quot; and &quot;Patton.&quot; The way the beginning is shown (sort of jumpy, from the eyes of a soldier) is great. It really makes you feel like you were there. The sound effects, sets, etc. were all really really good as well.The story/plot was good, and interesting. There wasn't a part of the movie where I was bored; even the parts of the movie where nothing was really happening had me sitting on the edge of my seat.The characters are all believable, and the acting is very good. The cast was well chosen.But I don't know whether or not it is completely accurate. Obviously there are no major flaws, but if it was COMPLETELY accurate is hard to say (I'm not an expert).If you haven't seen this movie, you better soon!	5.0	A great movie, and here's why:	2000-11-27	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3D39LXP3KQIP8	Lasse	The perspective of this movie was wonderful=) the American solders' experience on D-Day looked like footage I've seen of the actual beach it took place on several documentaries. And it all felt very realistic!  Spielberg did an amasing job of bringing the war to the big screen! I read  some reviews others had writen on this film and a lot of different  oppinions=) I don't really know what to think of this movie if I'd try to  really compare with how the actual D-Day felt, you have to have been there!  I really hate the whole idea of war! And I guess I saw this movie as a  great tribute to those who fought and died in the WW2! I think the choice  of this particular perspective of a small group of solders asked to save  one man was perfect in showing viewers the questions solders actually  constantly obsessed about during the war! it really gives us an inkling of  how difficult it is to understand meaning of war, what you had to  sacrifice! I mean the awful choices that had to be made! trying desperatly  to believe what they're doing is right?

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1YVPBDG2OFMD2	Leif Sheppard	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is, by all accounts, an American masterpiece and one of the premier World War II films. Its release on Blu-Ray has been highly anticipated and, for the most part, it doesn't disappoint. First of all, the transfer is every bit as astonishingly sharp as expected. I am by no means a videophile, but there didn't appear to be a single moment of artificial enhancement of the film. The print is appropriately accompanied by a slight sheen of grain whilst still retaining a high level of detail. As far as I'm concerned this is an easy five star transfer. The film runs 2:49:28 and features audio and subtitles in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Prior to the menu loading are two easily skippped trailers for the ""Minority Report"" Blu-Ray and the long overdue home video release of ""The African Queen"".There are no features on the first disc, not even a commentary track (Spielberg is well known for his dislike of commentary tracks). The special features are included on the second disc and all are presented in standard definition with the exception of the two film trailers. This is disappointing but not surprising, as it's something of an industry trend. There were no new features produced for this release, which is especially surprising considering the wealth of new high definition features that were produced for the""Minority Report""Blu-Ray. The positive side is that it pulls the features from all previous DVD editions. So even if it is all in standard definition, at least the consumer is presented with the complete special features collection. Most of the titles are rather self-explanatory, but here's a complete rundown of the features:1) ""Introduction"" (2:35) - Director Steven Spielberg discusses what attracted him to this project. This would've made more sense if it was included on the first disc with the film, as most will only put the second disc in after watching the film, thus making this more of an epilogue!2) ""Looking Into the Past"" (4:40) - This functions as a sort of extension of the introduction, as Spielberg discusses the influences that ultimately led him to creating this film.3) ""Miller and His Platoon"" (8:23) - This feature discusses the different personalities of the principle characters with particular focus on Tom Hank's character. Spielberg and Hanks also speak candidly about their interest in World War II in general. There's some interesting on-set footage included as well.4) ""Boot Camp"" (7:37) - This features the great Captain Dale Dye discussing how he helped train the actors for their roles, as well as the unique boot camp the actors participated in during production.5) ""Making Saving Private Ryan"" (22:05) - A strong making-of feature which highlights Spielberg's directing style relative to the film with some outstanding behind the scenes footage. This is far better than the typical promotional fluff studios place on video releases with a ""making of"" label attached.6) ""Re-Creating Omaha Beach"" (17:58) - An interesting feature discussing how the crew mounted the most impressive battle scene of the film.7) ""Music and Sound"" (15:59) - Composer John Williams discusses how he went about scoring the film.8) ""Parting Thoughts"" (3:43) - A nice bookend feature that contains bits of interview footage with Hanks and Spielberg.9) ""Into the Breach: Saving Private Ryan"" (25:01) - A standard behind-the-scenes feature covering production of the film. This feels like a promotional piece that was bumpered between films on television during its theatrical run. This feature was ported over from the original DVD release of the film and is in rather poor quality (even for standard definiton). I'm definitely glad they included this, but the ""Making Saving Private Ryan"" feature is far superior.10) ""Shooting War"" (1:28:05) - Tom Hanks (in full beard, as this was filmed while ""Cast Away"" was under production) hosts this feature focusing on the men who filmed and photographed World War II. This is perhaps the strongest feature here, bolstered by plenty of amazing war footage and anecdotes from veterans.11) Theatrical Trailer in High Definition (2:16)12) Re-Release Trailer in High Definition (2:05)To be fair, all the features truly do look quite excellent with the notable exception of the ""Into the Breach"" feature. I've been spoiled on the clarity of Blu-Ray, however, so it's still something of a disappointment. Aside from that, this is by far the best release of the film yet. The print is fantastic, it's a huge upgrade over the DVD, and the features are expansive and plentiful. Highly recommended!UPDATE 05/11/10: Apparently this Blu-Ray has been recalled because of an audio sync problem that occurs after Chapter 15 (about two hours into the film). I was aware of the claims on its release date, but even after watching my copy twice I never encountered any issues. Still, for the company to take this sort of action proves the problem is indeed legitimate, so hopefully Paramount's response will be swift and painless for those who have already purchased this product.FOLLOW-UP 05/26/10: The Blu-Ray issue has been resolved, Amazon only offers the corrected copies for sale and all other retailers should have them on the shelves now. If buying locally, the easiest way to tell the difference is to check the backside of the Blu-Ray for a yellow UPC sticker. Also, whereas the original defective discs were grey, the new corrected copies are blue discs."	5.0	"""Saving Private Ryan"" Blu-Ray Review"	2010-05-04	288	274	14

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3IUXRGEZYHHBY	Leo Stamps	Saving private ryan has to be the most acurate and realistic war movie ever made. The first twenty minutes shock the audiance and show in depth the horrors of the American landing on Omaha beach on june the 6th 1944.  Speilberg is the first director to give audiances a glimpse of the brutal  realitys of war without making the film a gratuatist shoot em up action.  The film set around the d-day landings is about a squad of men sent behind  enemy lines to find a private James Ryan (Matt Damon)who has lost all 3 of  his brothers who have been killed in combat. But during the search the  squad struggle to find decency during the confusion of war, they come  accross such hard decisions to make as whether to kill a POW,whether to  take out a german emplacement,and whether to take Ryan home or whther to  help him defend a bridge.A tremendous performance from Tom Hanks who stars  as Captain John Miller the leader of the squad and his men ,Sergeant  Horvath (Tom Sizemore),Private Reiben (Edward Burns)Private Jackson (Barry  Pepper) and a few more. Spedded up footage, juddering images,faded colour  so the film looks old and hand held camera use all contribute to making the  film nervous to look at. All together the film is a cinimatic masterpiece  and will make you feel nervous,sad and shocked.Saving private ryan is a  landmark mark in film industry everyone over 17 should watch and be stunned  by this mindblowing film.	5.0	Saving private ryan	2000-03-25	4	2	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AGP23PI7ODHPL	"""levi12"""	The opening sequence in this film grips the viewer like a soldier grips a yet-to-be-thrown grenade.  It takes your breath away and make non-veterans think, &quot;Is war REALLY like that?&quot;  The performances are solid  with Tom Sizemore--not Hanks--possibly turning in the best of all.  (Don't  think that Hanks wasn't good though.  He was as always.)  The only problem  with this movie is its surprisingly thin plot.  About halfway through the  film, it slows to the point of allowing the viewer to finally realize that  this movie is quite long.  With a careful shaving of unneeded scenes, this  could've been a much better film.  The power that bolts off the screens at  the bookends of the film is definitely worth the time though.	3.0	Grabs you by the neck. . .and then. . .lets go. . .	1999-11-30	7	5	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AGAR2DLEA4FF5	"Lisa Ebeling ""laa-laa"""	With every war movie I see I thank God, first that I'm a woman and that I've never had to face combat, second, that I've never lost an immediate family member to warfare, and, third, that no battles on the scale depicted  in this film have been fought on American soil in my lifetime.  There is  nothing glamorous or glorious about war, and &quot;Saving Private  Ryan&quot; drives this point home quite effectively.  I'm a woman.  I don't  know what it would be like to march straight into the jaws of death with a  piece of cold steel in my hands.  I'm a young woman.  I've never had to  kiss my father, brother, son, or fiance for perhaps the last time and sent  him off to face the horrors of ever-present fear, killing, and the constant  loss of friends and comrades.Could anyone return from battle  unchanged?  Could any individual remain intact body, mind and soul?  It's a  testament to the bravery, skill and intelligence (and sometimes cowardice)  of soldiers that anyone can survive war. My great-uncles and my Dad served  in the armed services before I was born.  I didn't know my second-cousins  before they returned from Viet Nam.  My brother-in-law commanded tanks  during Desert Storm.  I've been lucky; I haven't been called upon to make  the incredible sacrifice of the life of someone I dearly love in order to  ensure the freedoms I enjoy as an American.  Other individuals, other  families, have paid that price for me.  To them I am tremendously  grateful.&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; offers as close a look at real  combat as one could get without picking up a gun oneself.  The movie has  some terrific special effects and is well-paced and tells a gripping story  of courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty.  The film merits its  &quot;R&quot; rating.  It is not a movie that should be seen by children at  all.  The battle scenes are simply too graphic and too bloody.  No words  can explain to a child why a man would pick up a weapon and kill another  man whom he's never met.  Children cannot understand war--and neither can  many adults.The characters in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; are  true-to-life, completely believable, and the dialogue in keeping with the  WWII era.  This is a very well-made movie and every actor in it turns in a  superior performance.  There is not a half-hearted effort on the part of a  single actor (or actress) in the cast.Watching this film, I had to  think:  as our technology has improved, have the results of warfare changed  or improved?  Gaping holes are still blown through the bodies of strong,  brave young men, whether the weapons employed are muskets, cannons, rifles,  or machine guns.  I pray that our servicemen continue to demonstrate the  bravery and loyalty that led previous generations to fight our battles with  honor--and that our leaders, political and spiritual, have the wisdom and  integrity to carefully choose those battles which are truly worth the  sacrifice of the precious lives of those who fall on the battlefield.	5.0	Incredibly powerful.	2000-05-01	14	11	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"This review is about Saving Private Ryan in the context of its inclusion on the revised AFI Top 100 Film listing. It was not eligible for the first listing, which finalized in 1996. But as soon as the AFI redid their 10th anniversary ranking, Saving Private Ryan faulted into the #71 spot, right in there with many beloved classics such as Casablanca and Citizen Kane. It was just that powerful.On the first AFI listing, classics such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Patton gave us our view of war. Yes, War is Hell. Yes, there are good and not-so-good actions going on on both sides of the dividing line. But Saving Private Ryan brought this story to an entirely new level of cinematography. We weren't just watching a stage performance of how hard war can be. We were there, viscerally, in the deep of things, watching the world shake into pieces around us. We were shell-shocked from the sound, overwhelmed with the carnage, and watched as step by step our views on morality were eaten away.It is stunning just how many amazing actors are in here. Even small parts are played by actors who in other movies would take the leading role. Ted Danson. Nathan Fillion. Vin Diesel. They are everywhere. Every character has grounding and reality and personality.And these aren't all ""super-beings"" either. They have faults and weaknesses. They make mistakes. They trip up. Part of the joy of watching (and rewatching) the film is connecting with their humanity.I do have to point out that it seems as if there are only two brief appearances by women in the entire, long movie. The mom who crumples wordlessly to the ground when she realizes how her world has just been changed. The transcriber who realizes that three men in the same family have just been slain. And that's it. I suppose Ryan's wife at the end makes a brief comment. Certainly I know this is a movie about war - but people complained about Patton having no speaking women at all. Here we are, decades later, and our progress is that a woman or two are allowed to say a few words each. I'm not quite sure if that's progress. Other war movies show how critical women were to the war effort and to how intertwined they were in what was going on. Here, we barely know they exist.Still, if we're going to complain about that, we'll have to complain about so many movies that fall into this same trap. I think the only speaking woman in Platoon was a Vietnamese woman who said a few lines in Vietnamese. Clearly we have a long way to go.So, that all being said, Saving Private Ryan is an incredible movie, and well worth watching."	5.0	A Modern Classic	2012-09-21	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2ZZWRXXDOSEYS	lisa wrenn	I only wish that the captain's last words to Ryan were &quot;Godspeed&quot;, instead of &quot;Earn this.&quot;  They had all earned the right to go home, so what else could this poor guy do?  Nothing.  He could never do anything that would justify to himself that he had  earned the right to come home alive, expecially when other men died just to  get him their.  So I just don't agree with his last request to Ryan.  It  could have also been &quot;Get home alive.&quot;, and that would have been  hard enough.  Other than that, it was a 5 star movie and I've watched it  twice and will probably continue watching it anytime I get the chance.  You  can never get enough of how real it was for all those men to die for our  freedom, because freedom isn't free.	5.0	REAL!	2000-01-15	1	0	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2441CXD8TXS0R	Lloyd A. Conway	SPR may be the best war movie ever made, in terms of realism(if reports of WW II vets having flashbacks are to be believed).  Itis also, intentionally, a testament to the now-passing GI generation. As such, it is of a piece with Tom Brokaw's &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; and the shelf of Stephen Ambrose-authored books. SPR is a big-screen movie; it dosen't come across as impressively on a TV screen.  That said, it is still better than any other war movie that I've ever seen.  The beginning, when an old and ailing vet seeks out a cross marking the grave of his benefactor in a Norman cemetary for American war dead, limmed in clear sunlight, is moving.  The rest of the movie, ending excepted, is a flashback, as the camera focuses on his eye, entering it to reveal his memories.  This is not a complete flashback, as the portion of the movie leading up to the meeting of Cpt. Miller (Hanks) and Pvt. Ryan (Damon) would not have been a memory, although perhaps related to him by the surviving member of Miller's patrol afterward.  While there has been some criticism that this writer has read, from a German veteran, alleging flaws in the appearance and equippage of the German soldiers, virtually no average moviegoer will see anything that dosen't seem authentic, down to the tiniest detail.  (&quot;Patton&quot; and &quot;Midway,&quot; by way of contrast, used modern tanks and ships in scenes that were not actual war footage - these were easily identifiable as anacronisms.) Aside from technical excellence and utterly realistic combat footage (not for the squeamish, but not unnecessarily gory), the movie's most memorable trait is the aura of goodness that it cloaks America in. The idealism behind an American 5 star General personally intervening to save a mother's last living son, when they were common folk, is plausible in an American, but unthinkable in any other country.  Can you imagine a British, German or Japanese general acting in the same way?  Yet, it is believable to the audience that an American would. (In their defense, foreginers could point out that the mission was described by Miller's patrol as &quot;FUBAR.&quot; They had their own lives to lose, and mothers, too.)  The nostalgia for a 'good war,' as Studs Terkel called it, with America on the moral high ground, permeates the story.  Gen.  Marshall's reading from Lincoln's actual letter to a Civil War mother who lost all her sons in battle, itself highly idealistic in tone, embodies the theme of the movie, which has to do with the goodness of the American ideal.  That said, the movie does not stoop to flag-waving; the grimmness of Omaha Beach is unmixed with syrupieness and jingoism.  This is a sobering film; like any realisytic war movie must be, it is also anti-war.  I wish that every high schooler, and every Member of Congress would watch it. -Lloyd A.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A10F2OC6Q0P3HY	lorien@maitreya.demon.co.uk	Saving Private Ryan is a very good film - its just not a great one. As it has one fatal flaw - the middle of the film.The opening 40 minutes is perhaps the greatest war sequence put on film showing the full horror of the D-Day landings. Similarly the end sequence where they defend the bridge is horrifically realistic. There can be no doubt about their power. Many people will no doubt give the films 5* on this basis. If the film had consisted purely of these two parts I would have no doubt given it 5* as well.However, the film has a very weak middle containing very little of note except some deeply stereotyped characters wandering about looking for Ryan. Consider Tom Sizemores loyal Sergeant, Adam Goldberg's token Jew, Barry Pepper's bible thumping sniper, Giovanni Ribisi's gushing one dimensional medic not to mention the rest.I'm also annoyed that Spielberg also returns to his vision of pantomimesque Nazis - one dimensional, inscrutably evil with no vestiges of humanity and completely lacking in even basic human qualities. What made Schindlers List such a deeply moving film for me was that for once Speilberg portrayed the Nazi's for what they were - men - men with weaknesses just like you or I who did unspeakable things - it is this which truly relays the real horrors of what they did - that they were men, just like us, not pantomimesque villains. And that made it powerful. Witness Ralph Fiennes ' Camp Commandant taking the young boy in and letting him tend his house only to later callously shoot him for sport.I prefer The Thin Red Line which was released around the same time as SPR - anyone buying this DVD should definitely buy it as they will find much in common but a far greater emotional experience. It is a superior film albeit lacking in the shock value of the D-Day landing sequence in SPR.The good news is that the overall package of extras on this DVD is excellent and should keep enthusiasts of commentaries etc happy.Overall a good film, just not a great one.	4.0	Excellent WWII film but no Thin Red Line	2001-03-07	5	4	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A20IOTRKF4YRM7	LuKus McAll	Sure, the beginning of Steven Spielberg's film is captivatingly realistic. Blood and gore is set on a fearful stage of death, and gunfire. Bodies are blown all over the place. But the very story that follows that beginning weakens what could be a spectacular docu-drama of D-Day.The writer, later making a big mistake with &quot;The Patiot&quot; creates some very good character development in the platoon, lead by Tom Hanks. But certain trite mishaps in dialogue create questions of authenticity.Overall, by the end, we have the effect Spielberg was searching in his masterful directing. We have to look on the soldiers during WWII as being courageous, heroic and very human. They saved the west, the east and created a new world for us. Sacrifices had to be made, unfortunately.It's a marvel in visuals, directing, and story structure. Just not perfect.	5.0	A great one, but NOT THE BEST	2001-08-07	4	2	2

This movie shows, to those who were blessed enough to not have to serve in war, the brutal and gaustly image of World War II. Tom Hank was everything that a military man should be. Private Ryan was the patriot that we expect every American soldier to be.There is a very good moral lesson taught in this movie. Somewhere along the course of our lives, someone made a sacrifice so that you could be where you are now. Earn it. Earn that sacrifice that they made, and don't let it have been made in vain. I think this is a lesson we could all learn from.	4.0	Very chilling and horribly true movie.	2001-11-26	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1XX37HBK45UG8	L. Wallach	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those films that even if you haven't seen it, you've undoubtedly heard about it.  You have probably heard about the first 10 minutes being some of the most brutally realistic of all the movie footage attempting to show war.  Both this reputation and the rave reviews that the movie has received are completely justified in this reviewer's opinion.  The movie in general emphasizes the brutality of war, how people ""just like us"" had to go through hell, and how a lot of it was completely random and nonsensical.  For those of us lucky enough to not have to face warfare, this movie opens your eyes to the incredible fear and uncertainty that these men faced and how lucky we are that we did not happen to be born in the mid 1920's or earlier, or that we currently do not reside in countries that are undergoing such warfare.  It also makes you understand how lucky you are that these men were willing to give the ultimate sacrifice so that we can enjoy the life we do today.The movie, as you probably know, starts out with the D-day invasion of Normandy, where thousands of American soldiers were pushed shipped to the shore of ""Omaha beach"" to face a seeming wall of bullets that cut through most of them killing them on the spot.  Spielberg's footage of this scene approximates to whatever degree possible, what a an American soldier would have seen as he tried desperately to wade through the dead bodies in the water to seek some limited shelter on the dunes.  There is no sense to the action that we see, only little clips of men being torn apart by metal in a very unglamorous way.  One soldier speaking to another one second would face a dead, mangled corpse the next.  There was no time for crying or thinking, one had to simply keep going despite whatever agony these men must have been feeling - the fear must have overridden this completely.We follow Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), as he makes his way to the dunes and somehow miraculously is able to breach the German machine guns mowing down Americans at a ridiculous rate.  Afterwards we see how the devastation that these men had to go through finally comes out in the uncontrollable crying after the fear has finally subsided.Miller soon gets a special assignment that he questions and makes the viewer question, despite our initial acceptance.  A mother has lost three of her four sons in the war within the last week.  She will soon get three telegrams. ....  Despite the protestations from some of those around him, he decides to send a small squadron of men to go find the fourth son, and ferret him to safety so that his mother would not lose her last son to the war.  Her son being Private Ryan, and the Squadron chosen being Miller's.  Though initially we feel for the mother, through Miller's protestations and later those of his men, and eventually even Ryan himself, we come to the realization that this mission is more political or a personal issue for the general rather than something that coincides with the rest of the war effort. ....The squadron is made up of a number of men who do not really stand out very much.  They come from different backgrounds, one Italian, one Jewish.  They have their own issues to deal with, such as the medic (Giovanni Ribisi)...  But for the most part they are fairly normal men with normal backgrounds.  The one character that stands out is that of Corporal Timothy E. Upham (Jeremy Davies), a translator plucked from the beach after all the reinforcements arrived.  Upham seems like he could have been a modern-day college student thrown back in time.  He has only touched a gun in a brief basic training and is so fearful about the possibility of actually seeing combat that he is almost useless.  Because of this, we can identify with him more than with any of the other soldiers who have been through the hell of Omaha Beach.The DVD has an excellent 5.1 DD soundtrack that really puts you on the battlefield with lots of subwoofer and rear-channel usage.  The picture is similarly good, though you can tell that there's an intentional graininess to provoke a sort of newsreel quality to the film.  There are some special features, including cast and crew bios, trailers, production notes, a short speech by Steven Spielberg, and a making-of featurette.  The featurette is very good, including clips from the film, interviews with cast and crew, as well as historians like Stephan Ambrose.  Through these interviews, and especially through Ambrose, who's eloquent and moving oratory matches his literary talent, it really sinks in how amazing it was that men like those around us today, who had never held a gun before, suddenly were thrust into such inconceivable violence and chaos and did this willingly for the good of the country and the cause.  This is really something that jars you from the  cynicism inherent in our society today."	5.0	An amazing wake up call.	2000-12-14	7	5	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A16Y94MO3GL0W6	Lyn Tobin	I admired this movie immensely.  I think that Steven Spielberg knows how to get to our heart better than anyone.  (I think he took lessons from Disney.)He makes us feel for the characters right from the start and  then we get carried along his roller-coaster ride to reveal who survives at  the end.The realism and humanity he reveals to us in this truly  exceptional movie encompasses all that is TRUE about war.  Nobody was ready  for the landing at Omaha Beach, except maybe the Germans.  It reveals how  these brave men, knowing that most of them will be injured or killed,  stormed the beaches anyway, and they did it for ALL OF US.Then the story  takes a turn when the eight men, led by Capt. John Miller, are sent to  rescue a James Francis Ryan, whose three brothers have already been killed,  and return him home to his mother.  The eight soldiers aren't too unhappy  about the mission until one of them dies.  Now the question is asked,  &quot;Is this man's life worth dying for?&quot;Tom Hanks is as usual  brilliant as Capt. Miller, as is Tom Sizemore, who I thought should have  been nominated for Best Supporting Actor, instead of Matt Damon.Jeremy  Davies is very convincing as Upham - the translator, who tries at the very  beginning to tell Capt. Miller that he has never experienced combat before.  This fact becomes very clear to us in a tense moment in the  movie.Spielberg also shows us the wonderful role the Medics had in  War-time.  In the movie the soft-hearted and caring medic Wade not only has  to experience all the action of a soldier but also has to try and help save  or ease the pain of the injured and dying.This is a wonderful,  heart-warming movie.  I recommend it to anyone.  We should never forget the  sacrifices these men gave to make us what we are today.  It doesn't matter  what country you are from, the men who took part in World War II did so for  HUMANITY.  LEST WE FORGET.PS  Did anyone see the mistake in the movie.  Just after Caparzo dies, when the seven men have left the airmen at the  crashed plane site, you see eight men walking through the green grass to  again look for Pvt. Ryan.  What can I say, I'm a counter.	5.0	A Magnificent Portrayal Of The Sacrifices Of War	1999-12-11	4	2	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A173LLYL9EUW0O	L. Young	Saving Private Ryan is by far the most amazingly spectacular film I have ever seen. In addition to delivering an important anti-war message, it also delivers an important series of facts of what the Second World War was like  for the average American foot soldier. D-Day has often been described as a  100% successful operation, basically a breeze for our troops and the  British. In truth, however, over 8,000 Allied troops lost their lives that  day, compared with only 5,000 Germans. 2,000 men alone died on Omaha Beach.  While the D-Day objective for the troops landing on Omaha was to drive five  miles inland, they were stopped after about about a half a mile. The  Germans were not the incompetent poor soldiers as portrayed in some WW2  movies, they were a savagely effective fighting force. The film, does an  excellent job of removing these misconceptions. I remember walking out of  the theater after the film's conclusion and seeing several veterans  weeping, being comforted by their families. Sights such as these  immediately helped my understanding of how powerful this movie truly is. A  sight like that is powerful for anyone to see, much less an 18 year old  like me. I believe that this movie is a story that needs to be told. It is  to World War II what All Quiet on the Western Front is to World War I, and  Platoon to Vietnam. This is not a movie you should see, it is a movie you  MUST see.	5.0	a film to remember	2000-01-12	54	42	12

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A17NVM7IAPF2NS	Maek	I'm not a firm advocate of war and neither is this film--as it should be.However, America's involvement in this war is one of the reasons that I am alive.  My mother is American and my father is Belgian and they would never have met if Germany still occupied Belgium today.  There are still some regions in Belgium today (especially the Ardennes) where people are so grateful for being freed from Germany's occupation that they can't help themselves in expressing it.  In fact, once, I recall that my family and I were overheard speaking English and it was quickly found out by the owner that we were American.  Our meal was free as a result despite our protestation.My point?  It is often amazing that some people treat World War II as an event in history as opposed to great sacrifices made to prevent evil.  Willing or not, for those who fought, I send my deepest respect to the utter, living hell they must have gone through.  There is only one place that film could not have possibly have entered...and that is the minds of those individuals...and it's the only fault that a film could not possibly overcome as it has exceeded in all other areas.  And by no means am I belittling any war that has occurred in the past, but despite the selfishness of it, this one means more to me because I am alive to write about it.When I was very young, I participated in a memorial service on the beaches of Normandy.  I was chosen because it seemed fitting to those holding the memorial that someone of Belgian and American blood deliver the wreath to the front.  I barely remember it, but my parents remember it quite vividly.Do yourself a favor and visit Normandy one day...the graves are sobering, and the concrete bunkers are chilling.  Some of us build buildings for offices; those bunkers were built to bring death down below.Let's remember the distinction that we should build life now and cherish it.  Let's remember the horrors that may occur if we do not do so.My only regret is that my words are only a pitiful shadow of what I wish to express.  Please watch the movie and understand that we can't look at someone and call them brave or cowardly.  We should look at them and say, &quot;These are human beings.&quot;  And no human being deserves that treatment...ever.	5.0	Owing my life...	2001-05-15	2	2	0

It was so good up to that point.  I still give it 4 stars, but I  feel that the movie was unduly cheapend by most of the scenes near the  end.This movie has many very good, rich scenes... Probably the most  highly vaunted is the initial scene of the beach landing... yet there were  several scenes that I found more powerful and more substantive.However,  ultimately this movie is reduced to the normal action flick formula wherein  the enemy is personified in an individual and revenge is the ultimate  vindicator.

The depiction of the landing on Normandy Beach is one the most  intense battle scenes I have ever seen.Spielberg has not only paid a  deserving tribute to the veterans of World War II, he has also produced an  excellent anti-war film that shows the true horror of  warfare.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1D2AXVN20OQZD	Marc A. Coignard	I can understand why some people wouldn't like this movie (SOME people...the &quot;profatable propagana&quot; review confused me...).  Some have said that, other than the extreme violence, the movie's dialouge and  characters are cliche.  I'll agree to some extent with that.  Others have  said that other than the battle scenes the movie is lacking in plot.  Well,  I don't agree, but I can understand why someone would think that.  But this  movie tells a truth rarely seen in War films. It's brutally honest, in  fact.  Although the Privates and Copl. Upham are rather cliche, that  meaning that you can see types like them in almost every war movie made,  the Cpt. Miller and Sgt. Horovath represent the more human and less  &quot;John Wayneish&quot; war hero of the past.  They are common men sent  to fight in a war.  It may seem questionable to some why Spielberg chose  WWII as the war for this picture.  It was a just war that needed to be  fought, yet this movie almost seems to show us that war is bad because of  how devestating it is.  If anything, Tom Hanks' Cpt. Miller's final line in  this movie sums up the whole point of the moive: &quot;Earn This.&quot;  He  isn't simply telling Pvt. Ryan to earn his trip home and his men's  sacrifice to save him.  I think that line is going out to all of us in the  world.  These men went through hell and saved the world for our freedome.  It's time to earn it, and its time to say thank you.  Saving Private Ryan  is an excellent War movie.	5.0	The Best War Movie Ever Made	1999-11-25	18	14	4

A ground breaking film, it explores the psychological aspect of solders in war; what  makes them kill, what makes them fight on, and the horror expierianced on  both sides of the gun. It also explores the solder's relation to it's  country, in that you are bound to wonder after all is said and done, did  the U.S. have the right to decide if which man's life was important enough  to send a small troop after him? In smaller terms, who got to live, and who  got to die. Watch it. It's brilliant.

Saving Private Ryan is the cream of the crop, when it comes to war movies.  Everything Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg touch is gold.  The cinematography is wonderful and the action scenes are very realistic.  Spielberg takes great care to develop some meaningful characters.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2LD30KWC5UEF7	Maria Herrera	One of the most significant reasons to see this film, is that it is good story telling. All too often, message based movies bring up cynicism in it's viewers and, in an effort to appear as a savvy consumer, the audience  misses the point. Like a lot of people, I nearly had to get up and leave  during the now infamous 30 minute sequence of uninterrupted violence in the  early half of the film. But, I am glad I stayed. Saving Private Ryan  delivers interesting characters that you can easily identify with and  emotionally invest in. I won't get sidetracked into discussing it's social  implications. If Spielberg can resist the urge to preach, than so can I.  But, I will say that as our vetrans slip out of our midst, maybe the time  has come that this sort of film-making (and viewing) has become essential,  rather than optional. Afterall, there is a reason that history repeats  itself, and a reason that on Memorial Day we say: Lest We Forget.	5.0	Important  Film-Making!	1999-11-24	4	3	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AEXBEDCCR42W2	Mark Burnsworth	The first time I saw this movie at the theater, I had more emotional reactions to it that any other movie before or since....At the beginning I was stunned, and shocked, I knew of Omaha Beach, but I never felt or lived through it. Wow....Then scenes like the General reading the Lincoln letter, emotional. What got me the most, and may not get others, is when the older Ryan is kneeling in front of the the grave stone and turns and asks his wife if he has been a good man? I lost my brother, and that feeling resides within me to go on....and seeing that on screen had deep meaning for me. Great movie, so many other good things to say, except I would never allow children to see it. Its too graphic and realistic in the war scenes.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A13WK0568LZNL0	"Mark Coffey ""austindeadhead"""	I have seen Saving Private Ryan 6 or 7 times and I never fail to be amazed at the technical wizardry that is the Normandy Beach scene.  There has probably never been a great moment in history so closely realized for those of us fortunate enough not to be there.  I see many people on here with one-star reviews, some taking Speilberg to task for exploiting D-Day, somehow, by showing what happened.  Listen to the veterans, folks, before it's too late to hear their voices...they say this is exactly how it was.I don't believe there could ever be another event like the second World War, and I don't believe there has ever been a more faithful attempt to capture it.  Yes, the surrounding story is sometimes hokey, but the four set pieces (D-Day, the Sniper and the French Villagers, the Machine-Gun Nest at the Radar Station, and the Last Stand at the Bridge) are magnificent.  A truly historic film, in both senses of the word.	5.0	Spielberg's Most Ambitious Directing	2004-10-16	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A11A8GWG0IXBZH	"Mark Hills ""Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!"""	To be granted such an intimate and horrific look at one of the most pivotal moments in the history of this world, the D-Day invasion of the beaches at Normandy, provides us with a stark and brutal look at one of the  last campaigns of World War II. It deconstructs the myths associated with  how we look at WWII, that there is no glory in killing or being killed, but  instead a horrible failure of ourselves as human beings. At the same time,  however, there was a need, a dire need to remove Hitler and fascist tyranny  that he and the Nazis threatened to spread across Europe and possibly the  world. It was a battle of ideologies and it was a conflict of good vs.  evil.Saving Private Ryan is fictional, up to an after the events of  June 6th, 1944, but at the same time, the fact it isn't an adaptation or  the retelling of an actual event is irrelevant. From the beginning of an  elderly James Ryan on his knees before the crosses and Stars and David at  Normandy, we see the war as if it were real and in color. Speilberg's use  of lens used by photographers at the time gives the film a decidedly  gritty, almost primitive look that only enhances the assault to the senses.  The violence, however accurate, takes on surreal form all its own. The  explosions that removes limbs or destroys the body completely only  accentuates the fact that the human body was not meant for conflict of this  scale. This isn't some 1950's or 60's John Wayne war movie where the hero  takes a bullet and can keep going, more likely the hero gets shot goes into  shock and probably dies. The horror of war is as real as the film makers  could have made it. You feel for the characters and when they die, you  share the loss.The story is simple and unbelievable, but like so  many things in World War II, stranger things have happened. Captain John  Miller (Tom Hanks) of the 2nd Rangers is asked to go deep into France in  order to recover Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), the last of four brothers  in the war and the last one still alive. Ryan, a part of the 101st Airborne  Regiment and just one of thousands of misdrops and got lost all over  France. Miller leads a small party of eight men-who would really rather not  be doing this. It causes them to question their orders and Captain Miller  who must maintain the order amidst the chaos of the war around. And this is  what is depicted all through out the film- confusion and the fog of war;  where no matter how good your plans are or how well trained your people  are, once the fighting start, those plans go straight to hell.I  think Saving Private Ryan might be the most important film of the 20th  Century-it has no equals, even in Darryl Zanuck's 1962 D-Day epic The  Longest Day. It strips away the Hollywood glory of war and the perceived  notions many of us have. It is a companion piece to Spielberg's Holocaust  epic, Shindler's List. A teacher friend of mine-at the high school level  actually has students who haven't even heard of World War II. School  teachers in the US, Canada and Britain need to show this to their students  on a yearly basis so that they can at least have some idea of what  happened. We need to remember this, the Holocaust, and everything  associated with World War II for a very long time.	5.0	Through the Eyes of History	2000-04-23	6	5	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26BCYY56BM7MB	Mark Snyder	It's the 63rd anniversary of the allied invasion of Normandy today so in honor of the fact, I watched this movie! Although I have seen it countless times and can speak every line from memory, this movie never ceases to amaze me. The only problem that I have is that the landing on Omaha beach, despite having some of the best special effects, still isn't accurate in terms of the gore (not that that matters anyway). You see, I watched this film with my mom's uncle who is a surviving veteran of the same opening scene on Omaha beach. He saw everything shown in the film 63 years ago and said that it does a great justice to the men who fought and died, but Spielberg got it all wrong. He was touched by the movie but told me that if I could only imagine it infinitely worse, the blood, gore, and death on a larger and more horrifying scale; I would barely be able to grasp what he had to go through. Nevertheless, I love this film.	5.0	63rd anniversary	2007-06-06	5	3	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A4UN4NMHZHOUJ	"""marsh3"""	This is an awesome movie!  However, this &quot;widescreen&quot; DVD is not as it would seem.  Most widescreen DVDs display more information on screen than pan &amp; scan DVDs as the widescreen aspect ratio is like the  theater.  On this DVD, the widescreen version actually CUTS information  from the top and bottom of the pan &amp; scan picture.  I learned this  watching the movie on cable, noting that while talking about his shaking  hands in the church, CPT Miller's hands are on screen (and shaking) for  more of the discussion--on the DVD, not so!  Perhaps the  &quot;five-star&quot; video production team should obtain James Cameron's  essay on widescreen v. pan &amp; scan and learn that the selection of  aspect ratio and production should not detract from the finished product.  Again, a great movie, but this edition left me quite disappointed and  wondering how much else was disregarded.	1.0	Special Limited Edition Rip-off	2000-06-05	32	10	22
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AAW58LG72PG7I	"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor"""	All war movies capture a piece of the brutality that is war but only a very few bring forth the full carnage that war is.  In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Steven Spielberg drags the viewer out of his seat and throws him into the sound and fury of modern war.  Critics have noted that with the opening scene of GIs getting machine gunned by Wehrmacht troopers on Omaha Beach on D-Day, Spielberg begins a three hour howl of pain that affects the soul as much as it does the body.  It is impossible to feel nothing even for the Germans who die by the hundreds.Tom Hanks is Captain Miller who has the thankless task of bringing home Private Ryan whose three other brothers have died in battle.  The question of the morality to do this while others are equally deserving a ticket home is announced by Ryan (Matt Damon) himself who refuses to leave while his comrades need him.  It is this subtext of ethics versus pragmatism that imbues the film with the multi-layers of interpretation that result in equally multi-viewings. There are numerous scenes in which a soldier will pause while directly involved in a life and death struggle to detach himself from the fray to consider some basic concepts that mark him as human.  Jeremy Davies plays a GI interpreter who must face the morality of what it means to use his linguistic skills as simply one more element for killing the enemy.  Nearly everyone in Capt. Miller's squad also wonders whether their lives are collectively worth the one whose three brothers were killed.  What makes this insane struggle to quantify the unquantifiable work is the realization that the ability to judge the worth of such a sacrifice cannot be realized until much later when the now elderly Private Ryan pauses in front of the grave of Capt. Miller to pass judgment on an event that for everyone save him is only of historical interest.  To know that he is one who has tried his best to live the Good Life somehow lets him sleep at night.  We in the audience can share this most intimate of moments.	5.0	Tell Me I'm A Good Man	2008-09-07	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2AU3ZCKR9021Y	"""martinezboy"""	The realistic opening battle scene was made all the more riveting for me because my wife's uncle was killed in the D-Day landing at Normandy.  Uniforms, equipment, mannerisms and &quot;soldier speak&quot; seem true to  the period.  My problem is with the &quot;saving Ryan&quot; mission.  I  know there are plenty of other army/marine veterans out there that know how  lame it is to undertake a mission without a plan.  How about the dopey  scenes of ambling through fields in daylight or attacking a well defended  position on high ground (not part of the mission).  As a former Army medic,  I was vicariously P.O.d at this sloppy decision.  But...after all,  Spielberg never served in the military.  His military adviser (I believe a  retired Marine officer) must have really been brow beat to allow this goofy  soldiering to get by.  Other than this comment, a good addition to your  film library.	4.0	&quot;War is all hell.&quot; W.T. Sherman	2000-01-20	3	3	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AG42CYU5P8NVQ	Mathew A. Shember	"For some reason this film annoys me.  The film has a great cast and it has some spectacular parts which are really intense.  For example, the opening invasion was great.  I heard one vet remark.  ""The only thing missing was the smell.""  The knife fight between Mellish and the SS soldier was intense and even bothered some people.  I even liked the interaction between the soldiers during lulls.For me this could have been a better story if it was kept simple with the harsh realities of war.  However, what started to annoy me was the layers of schmaltz that were added in.  The premise sounds neat but I really doubt a veteran ranger unit would be sent to find one guy in the middle of a war zone.  It's a waste of highly trained men.Corpral Upham to me was an infuriating character.  I suspect that it's Spielberg injecting himself into the story as some story tellers sometimes do.  I am finding people either love him or hate him.  He annoyed me to no end and never mind the fact he got a few men killed.  Mellish, the paratrooper that was with him, and Captain Miller.Steamboat Willie.  This character became a blunder due to casting.  Many people think that he and the man who stabbed Mellish are the same.  They are not.  One is SS and Willie I think is Luftwaffe.  It gave the impression the Upham shot him for killing Mellish.Private Ryan.  Now I wish they left Matt Damon off the credits.  The fact I suspected he was Ryan took away from a great scene where the find a Private Ryan, tell him his brothers are dead, and learn it's not him.  It was really sad to hear him cry.  The shock factor was lost since I knew it was not him.One thing I noticed was wrong was the P-51 ""tank busters""  They really didn't do that often.  That was usually the job of the P-47 Thunderbolts.  The P-51 was an areal fighter and was not armored for that kind of duty.  I read somewhere somebody looked up the unit from the insignia of the planes and said they didn't have P-51s at that time.  They were still flying the P-47s.The second DVD is a ""watch it once"" thing.  It's interesting to see how they made the film but it's not something you will return to often.  I thought they could have done more with information about the battle itself.Overall, it's a good film.  But as I said it annoys me due to the premise and the schmaltz factor."	4.0	A decent film but it annoys me	2007-11-14	6	3	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3J7LWIOY7DHPZ	Matt Davis	Who will ever forget seeing SPR? I saw it in the theater when it came out, and I have yet to see it again. I will never forget how we got a glimpse of young teenage boys crying in pain, completely traumatized by the hellish fury of war. But I must say, deciding to write this review made me realize that my feelings towards this film are more mixed than I realized before. The beginning and ending of this film are unforgettable; but what about that long, stagnant middle section? There is so much in between that seems rather forgetable. Also, this movie would have been truly monumental if the story was as gripping as the fighting is. It simply lacks any kind of philisophical or moral inquiry; I walked away speechless, but I also at moments thought, &quot;ok, so what was all of that actually about?&quot; But don't get me wrong; you will understand all the hype once you see the beginning of the storming of Omaha Beach, an indisputable tour de force of cinematic art. But even that, taken by itself, should not earn a film a full five stars.	4.0	an important contribution to the american war genre	2001-10-21	2	1	1

The blood is bloody and the gore is gory, and there is attention given to the tough moral choices that soldiers have to face on the ground. For example, an enemy soldier who is spared comes back to murder a comrade, so I'm not sure if there's a feel good lesson for me to tap into anywhere. The cast and crew do a good job, but for some reason, this film just doesn't stick with me. Maybe I'm only interested in blood and guts if I can enjoy a vicarious thrill, and not if I actually have to think about the consequences of violence.	3.0	Emotionally impacting, but not enjoyable	2005-01-04	7	3	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	Saving Private Ryan has been hailed as the greatest war movie ever made. I personally still favor several others, including The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, and, perhaps a bit perversely, Dr. Strangelove. Still, Saving Private Ryan is a riveting, monumental movie, and it is the greatest film about the American experience in World War II. I don't think any other picture has ever so graphically and so unflinchingly shown what a terrible toll war - any war - exacts on armed forces. This is not a movie for children.Director Steven Spielburg seems to be our reigning movie making expert on W.W.II. In the early 1980s, he made the dreadful 1941, which was about German submarines prowling the West Coast. A few years later, he redeemed himself with the remarkable Empire of the Sun, which dealt with the Japanese occupation of China. In 1993, he gave us Schindler's List. This story of the plight of Jews in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany may be the most honored film ever made.It is no wonder, then, that Saving Private Ryan was made with every attempt at authenticity. I must warn you that this attention to detail includes some of the most violent and gruesome scenes ever put on film. Usually, I make a small attempt to protest excessive violence in movies, and I could argue here that Spielburg could have made his point with less of it here. Or that he has made the ultimate arguement for gun control. I think in this case, however, that, if we are to continue to have wars, then at least the atrocities that are a natural part of them have, for once, been portrayed with complete honesty.The movie begins on June 6, 1941 with the Normandy Invasion. This very long scene is one of the largest and most ambitious ever filmed. We watch as Captain John Miller [Tom Hanks] and his platoon, along with thousands of other soldiers, leave their landing boats and attempt to storm the beach. On the cliffs above are the well fortified German bunkers. Machine gun bullets come whizzing down like a rain from Hell. I won't go into gruesome detail, but one tends to watch this sequence in a sort of frozen horror. It is so lifelike that I have seen audience members flinch and act as though they needed to duck for cover.Back in Washington, a military office discovers that three brothers from Iowa have been killed on the same day in three different fronts. A fourth brother, Private James Francis Ryan [Matt Damon], a member of the 101st Airborne, is missing in action somewhere in France. It is decided that he must be found and brought home to his mother. The movie thankfully implies that this decision is a heartfelt one on the part of the military. Captain Miller's platoon is given the difficult task of finding Private Ryan.I will give you just a bit of history. The Normandy Invasion, while well thought out and most likely necessary, came at a very high price. And it was just the beginning, for the rest of France had to be reclaimed mile after dangerous mile. So, when Miller's platoon sets off to locate Private Ryan, they know they are going into a hornet's nest of German troops. To say this would have been a dangerous assignment is an understatement.The small group of soldiers is none too pleased at the thought of going into such territory to look for one man who may well be dead. Captain Miller, in the tradition of the best leaders, keeps his own opinion of the assignment to himself. He manages to keep his men on track, no matter what their personal feelings are. The search is filled with dreadful encounters, anger, frustration, and all the madness which is part of war's nature.Tom Hanks is such a fine actor with such an enormous range that it's rather difficult to say which one of his many performances is the finest. His Captain John Miller is decidedly near the top of the list. One of the finest elements of this movie is how it reminds us that real heroes are never super human. They are ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Hank's Miller is close to being an Every Man. Before the war, he was a school teacher in Pennsylvania, which is so typical of the men and women who made up the troops in W.W.II. In fact, there is nothing special about any of his man. Private Ryan, in fact, is just a kid from rural Iowa. By emphasizing their ordinariness, Spielburg reminds us that we are all special.Saving Private Ryan's point of view is more or less objective. By not playing too much on easy emotions, it manages to be patriotic, especially in homage to all veterans of W.W.II, without ever glorifying warfare.	5.0	Powerful film about the American experience in WWII	2002-03-23	1	1	0

They even gave a part to Vin Diesel, which he fit into well.

I feel sorry for my cats because they  thought it was the real deal and hid for most of the movie. If you have a  DTS capable DVD player and receiver, by all means, buy this movie.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3BY1S1N2NEIUG	Matt Knuthschen	The first 25 minutes of SPR, as everyone says, are breathtaking and horrifying at the same time. It is sheer perfection.However the problem with this film is Spielberg's storytelling, the cliches in the scenes, the forced romantic pseudo-patriotic air that you breath in each spoken scene. It is not told in a realistic way -a problem that Spielberg has in many of his films, he tends to sentimentalize and simplify- and the film becomes very uneven: perfect on the technical side, hollow, shallow on the dramatic side.Band of Brothers, however, did nail the misfortunes of soldiers in battle; and it felt real.One last thing: Saving Private Ryan did capture battles in a way no other film had, it took war scenes to another level in cinema, and that is a lot more than most war films -not all of them- had achieved in the past.And another one last thing, to people who like really good war films, I recommend: Paths of Glory, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Patton, Tora Tora Tora, Black Hawk Down, and, please, watch Band of Brothers, it is an INCREDIBLE miniseries.Thanks for reading and farewell.	3.0	Excellent war scenes, weak storyline.	2003-06-04	6	4	2

Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, the leader of the squad sent to rescue him.  The film is extremely dramatic, sad, depressing, and graphic.  These are the elements that let you know it's GOOD.  If you're looking for an action movie, this isn't for you.  Although there are action scenes, this isn't an action movie.  It's a war movie, the Best one ever made.  It bugs me as people see this as an action movie and nothing more.This is the only movie i almost cried at.  It was when Arwen Wade, the medic, is shot and bleeds to death.  The saddest part is his last words &quot;i wanna go home, i wanna go home! momma! momma....&quot; When you see this one scene, you will understand why Spielberg won Best Director.  Also, i can't understand how a horrible movie like Titanic can win 11 oscars, and this wins 5!!! what's wrong with the oscars???!!! This movie deserved a lot more oscars, including Best Picture, without a doubt.	5.0	Best Movie ever made	2004-03-10	3	3	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3FWTRMHNABHZ1	Matt Virchow	SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stars Hollywood actors: Tom Hanks (Cast Away), Matt Damon (Dogma), Tom Sizemore (Red Planet, Pearl Harbor), Edward Burns (15 Minutes) and Giovoni Ribisi (Gone in 60 Seconds).  This film is also directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, Jaws).  What makes this film so amazing is how memorable and realistic it really was.  It should have no doubt, hands down, no questions asked; won BEST PICTURE in 1998!!  At least Spielberg shined with the BEST DIRECTOR award!  The opening scene on Omaha Beach really pulls you into the battles or World War II.  There are even times when you almost want to look away!  This film's high flying bullets, explosions, desposed bodies and realism of what WWII was like really sets a standard for other war films to look up to.  THE THIN RED LINE was a poor excuse for a war film.  They took big actors like: Nick Nolte, George Clooney (who was only in the film for maybe a minute), Sean Penn, and Woody Harrelson and rolled into something trying to copy SAVING PRIVATE RYAN- but it couldn't... No way!  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is more realistic and more emotional.  All the performances and filming are fantastic- it's just phenomenal filmaking that all homes should have.  Whether you buy it on DVD or VHS, it still gives you that feeling, where you really start looking back at all the men who risked their lives and died on the battlefields, for us, for freedom.  Imagine all your family being siblings dying in the war, your mother getting all the telegrams saying &quot;your child is dead, we're sorry&quot; in one day!  You were the only one left and eight daring, tired men go across all the battles and all the dangerous situations to rescue- you.  Only you.  What a debt you'd owe them.  This is a true epic that sticks its story, doesn't have holds, and keeps that drama-war action/adventure flowing.  You can never look back at World War II the same way again.  Thank you Steven Spielberg for showing us how much we take for granted, and who we owe so much to.  So the next time you feel like you don't want to go to work, or school because you are too tired- put yourself on the battlefields of WWII and see how it feels for a day.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan so true, so real, such a masterpiece...	2001-03-16	5	2	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2SPR37QY7G2FB	"Max_DTP ""Max_DTP"""	I started reading accounts of what happened in WWII when I was in grade  school. I couldn't stand the anticeptic way Hollywood had portrayed WWII  and felt it diminished the greatness of what our fathers and grandfathers  had done. When I was 14 I saw a cool new movie called &quot;Star Wars&quot;  and asked why they couldn't do a WWII movie with that kind of FX. 20 years  would pass before my wish came true. Anyone who doesn't believe what they  saw in Saving Private Ryan hasn't read about or seen any real combat. Every  gory detail from the sniper being shot through his scope (Stalingrad)to the  armless man carrying his severed limb to the aid station (Cold Harbor, Iwo  Jima) I've read in non-fiction accounts of combat over the last 25 years.  It was the attention to detail and the overall sense of fear and chaos  conveyed throughout the film that was nesessary to understand the enormity  of the invasion and the sacrifice of the average American servicemen. That  Mr. Spielberg was able to give those characters life and make you cheer for  them on top of all this raw emotion is a tribute to his ability as a  director.	5.0	A Great Tribute to the Greatest Generation	2000-06-17	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A35XMSURGM0L1N	M. Buisman	Ok, It's kinda hard for a 25 year old to say if a movie is realistic or not based on other reviews and the movie itself that seems to be the case. The much talked about first half-hour of the movie is indeed gruesome. If you have a weak stomach or can't stand the really horrible war pictures you can skip this, there is no important storyline in it and therefore unimportant for the rest of the movie, it is however a brilliant piece of filming.The movie itself is mostly set in shades of green and grey, making the imagery beautiful and therefore worth seeing. It's again a great Spielberg movie, especially in its realism and if you want to get a good view about how D-Day was see this, maybe together with the great mini-series Band of Brothers.	5.0	One of the most realistic movies ever made	2005-05-12	6	3	3

It was Spielberg's tribute to the genre, but the pacing and gore made it seem a lot more 'realistic' than most war movies.  One moment sticks in my  mind as when I realized this:  After unseen bazooka fire knocks out the  Sd.Kfz. 251, our first glipse of Ryan himself is like a visitation, arising  from the brush looking like a young Apollo. :^) Then again, I may be the  only one who feels this way.	5.0	Good film, but not quite what it may seem.	1999-11-28	3	2	1

The brutality, carnage, ferocity, fear and the sacrifice of selfless heroism is portrayed perhaps as never before in a motion picture.The almost 'real-life' scenes of suffering and terror coupled with hope are heart-rending.Many of the actual combatants of the D-day landings which this film is based around, verify the 'close to reality' nature of some of the scenes.I have watched some of the scenes time and again and my heart goes out to those who suffered and died during the conflict.This is a fitting epitaph to the memory of those who were there.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AMC537PXPF5EQ	Medard G. Ylagan	Captain John Miller is ordered to take his squad behind enemy lines on a dangerous mission to find and retrieve one man, the youngest of the four brothers who have all been killed in action within days of one another, and hw is the last survivor among them.MISSION: SAVING PRIVATE RYANWorld War II was a pivotal event of the 20th century and a defining moment for America and the world. It shifted the borders of the globe. It forever changed those who lived through it, and shaped generations to come. It has been called &quot;the last great war&quot;, hopefully it will be.The jaw-dropping velocity of this shattering piece of filmmaking lodges hard in the mind. One leaves the cinema with a drained, feeble gait as the mind attemps, if not to free the mind of the terror it has just encountered, but just to accept it. As a generation, we have become sadly distanced from these realities which ravaged another generation so brutally. This film is most certainly a wake-up call for all those who mock the old, believing all that their war stories amounted to was a tedious &quot;during the war&quot; monologue on obsolete battle techniques. The first forty minutes of horror, when the camera weaves in and out of the most brutal and gritty a massacre i have ever seen, one does not spectate but partake. Even the camera seems to be flinching as it takes us on a jittery paranoid sweep of the heartbreaking carnage that unfurls before us, as if itself fears the bullet. This documentary style spares the film from Hollywood glamorization and the distinct lack of infuriating wisecracks was fantastically refreshing. This certain breed of heroism is therefore lent an unprecedented credibility-putting pay to the ridiculous Hollywood notion, that while being surrounded by carnage and dodging bullets, you actually care to make inane banter - men are reduced to screaming fetal messes crying for their mothers, that is real terror, the type that makes you want to return to the womb, the stuff of nightmares. It is in this uncompromising harshness that the core of humanity is found. Spielberg grabs history and rips it open to leave the exposed bleeding heart of man. It is on this note that one leaves the stalls, with a grating sense of mortality. Spielberg wished this film to resensitize us to violence, and that it most definitely does, it makes violence actually violent. In comprehending this, we begin again to appreciate our own mortality, to take a look around and re-evaluate our life. Being assaulted by death, life seems all the more alive. It is on Capt. Miller's dying words that we feel weak walking into the air, for after all they sacrificed, look at all the world must earn.As the saying goes, &quot;history repeats itself&quot;, we just all hope and pray, a war as gruesome as this will never happen amidst our time, especially now that the problem on terrorism has been worsening and worsening day by day. We all wish to spend a truly peaceful, Merry Christmas and a new year.	5.0	MISSION: SPR	2001-10-18	1	1	0

(the only exception being &quot;SCHINDLER'S LIST) He is always sentimental, defending the so-called &quot;american way of life&quot;. He's  a false sentimental man. In this movie, the battle sequences are the best  ever made. It showed naive people (because I think few people needed to see  this movie to know that war is hell) how it was, using sheds of blood. But  the plot... it's ridiculous, extremely patriotic (it had to have an  American flag in the end...), but the actor really look like soldiers.

The landing and ground fighting shown in the Normandy invasion literally makes the viewer feel like they were transported in time and are actually experiencing the real thing!Tom Hanks is brilliant as a shell-shocked veteran who is asked to perform a special service.  That is to go through enemy territory and bring back the last surviving son of the Ryan clan.  His other brothers having all recently perished in combat, leaving him the only remaining son.The movie grips you from the start and there are some well scripted scenes with a lot of surprises in Hanks search for the last Ryan.  You go through the movie hoping that Hanks will find him soon and be able to leave the hell of war before his nerves are totally shot.What made this movie even more dramatic is that it is based on a true story!

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	In viewing this incomparable essay on the human spirit and the value of every human life, one can't help but be enthralled with the cinematic genius of Stephen Spielberg, his unbelievable cast, cinematographers, editors, sound men, special effects---truly the consummate cinematic experience.  But at the same time, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN addresses people like me, who haven't fought in any wars, and haven't seriously been affected by the loss of someone we loved in such a war.  Until you see a movie like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, war is merely a term meant to enable us to understand what a sick and violent world we live in.  I am still haunted by the powerful scenes in this movie, that opened my eyes to the terror and frustration, the fear and loneliness, of all these soldiers.  With Spielberg's brutal uncompromised look at what a bullet can do, I have come to respect even more the brave men who have fought for this country, who have died, who have been wounded, lost friends and comrades, and had to understand up close the fear and horror of war.From the devastating opening sequence on the beaches of Normandy to the cataclysmic battle for the bridge, Spielberg helms a movie that is gutwrenching in its honesty, in its portrayal of war, and of the men who fought it.The cast is impeccable.  Tom Hanks is truly magnificent as Capt. John Miller; Hanks never postures the megastar persona one might expect, but instead leads the actors as if they were his soldiers, and his performance overwhelms in its sincerity and humanity.  How can one single out any of the rest of this cast--they are absolutely great:  Edward Burns, Matt Damon, the underappreciated Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi, even Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies, Adam Goldberg, Harve Presnell--intelligent, thoughtful and convincing performances from them all.In 2001, this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  This only substantiates the fact that the Oscars have succumbed to marketing strategies, studios putting tons of money into convincing voters that their movie is the best.  It is a disgrace that a film of the magnitude of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was eclipsed by the far inferior frothy comic antics of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  They even gave Judi Dench an Oscar for 8 minutes of hysterics, and ignored such Oscar worthy performances as Burns, Sizemore or Ribisi.No matter, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not only the best movie of 2001, but one of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood.You owe it to yourself to watch this classic!	5.0	THE BEST WAR FILM OF OUR TIME	2004-08-27	5	0	5

In real life it is a crock fom start to finish but a good film. Paradox? No! It is  entertainment. When a man is shot or is shot dead he drops like a wet sack.  Hanks is too old for the part as is everybody else save a few. The uniforms  are always so neet and tailored I would liike the name of their  quatermaster or tailor. Well shaved, clean boots, not jock itch, no bugs,  well fed, well mannered, well spoken. To the lowest private they all  graduated Harvard and went to the best Dentist that money could buy. My how  they fire their rifles and their shoulders do not move, BB guns? The  machineguns do not get red hot. The barrels are lifted by the steel after  ten clips. My how shells go off and what have you and no true blast and  they can still hear and talk. Lots of Gore, lots of bull and no doubt for  some that were not there lots of fun. The picture is well made but War it  ain't. As War movies go at least you will not vomit from disgust at this  one but to some it is funny....like vets. What do they call it in art,  aethetic distance. People are shot and their crotches are dry, their eyes  closed and the mortician must be following up the company.	1.0	A great War Movie for somebody who wasn't there	1999-11-04	33	10	23
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ALO4K8YRED8M4	Michael Donlon (mickeyd46@aol.com)	One of the worst choices for best-picture Oscar:  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; over &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; Spielberg was visibly stunned when his picture didn't win, and so was I.  This was one of the  best movies I ever saw, and I've been seeing them since 1949.  It easily  makes my top 20, maybe even top 10.  War has never been portrayed the way  it was in this movie, and Spielberg's camera and editing techniques put the  viewer right into the middle of some of the worst fighting of the war.  His  choice of a look-alike location for Omaha Beach, the construction and set  decoration of the French town (actually done on an air base in England),  and the use of very authentic-looking uniforms, weapons, and vehicles made  this movie stand out as the best war movie ever made, and I've seen all the  good ones.  Hanks' acting and the performances of the other men in his  squad were outstanding.  One reviewer called the movie a  &quot;visceral&quot; experience, and that's what it was for me.  Fear,  excitement, triumph, tragedy, and at last some kind of satisfaction, even  if not complete, marked this as a very emotional experience.  This film and  &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; Spielberg's two best, are more like  experiences than movies.  You really feel as if you're living these events  along with the characters instead of just sitting in a theatre watching a  movie. It's interesting that Spielberg's two best films, as well as his  third best (&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;) are the ones that are the most  realistic and rely the least on special effects.  You couldn't ask for a  better movie than this one. See it if you haven't already, and you probably  have.	5.0	PRAISING &quot;PRIVATE RYAN&quot; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	1999-10-21	2	2	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A5HMT6ZOBUAVM	"""michaeleve"""	If you start off with the clear understanding that this movie was meant to be a patriotic tribute to the men, in this specific case, the US soldiers that landed at Omaha Beach, and that Spielberg is going to use his prodiguous talents to make us feel for them - then you won't be disappointed. If you think that you are going to see a documentary and wish to remain emotionally unattached and unaffected by what you're watching - then skip this. The only thing documentary-like about 'Saving Private Ryan' is the realism of the landing scenes. Emotional? If you've ever wondered what battle is like, here's your answer. The violent, graphic scenes showing gore, blood, confusion, immobilizing fear, waste, chaos, heroics and the tremendous sense of relief and uncontrollable shaking from release are there, not because it's a 'War' and  an 'Action' movie, but because it's REAL. Get the picture - this is how war looks and feels. Brrr, chills.Although paying tribute to those men who went ashore in '44, it's also a strong anti-war movie, and it's not surprising that so many vets. have spoken out in praise of the movie, nobody is more anti-war than ex-warriors. The movie does justice to the randomness and suddeness of the violence. Bad luck, Karma, and certainly stupidity are factors. Private Caparzzo, well meaning, trying to help that little French girl, was nevertheless stupid. Most soldiers would sympathize, certainly as he bled to death in the rain, but there would not be much empathy. You do not step out in the open in a fire fight, or even if there is only a hint of the enemy.Enjoy may be too strong a word, but watch this movie just the same and if by chance you know somebody who was there, then simply, thank them.	5.0	Yes it's manipulative, sentimental and patriotic.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AZ1Y2WJPMGY6I	Michael Jacobs	No one doubts Spielberg is a master filmmaker, and few directors are so adept at manipulating the audience's emotions as he.  He's also a master image-builder and storyteller.  These skills he pushes to the limits in SPR  and the result is gripping and entertaining for those who can deal with the  film's often stomach-churning violence.  There is everything here - intense  drama and suspense, heroes overcoming incredible odds, humor, pathos,  internal conflict within the good guy camp, plenty of shooting and  explosions, a main character we identify with and care about.  Viewed as  pure action film this movie has few equals and I would gladly award it five  stars if it billed itself as such.However, Spielberg instead marketed  this film as an almost documentary-style account of Overlord.  He justified  the film's unprecedented level of gore by pointing out that he was making  the first truly &quot;realistic&quot; war movie in history and we needed to  see it like it truly was.  By taking this tack, he surrenders the right to  have his film judged by its story and style alone.Unfortunately, SPR  gets a lot of stuff wrong in the realism department despite having Stephen  Ambrose vouching for it (or perhaps because of it - Ambrose is a  controversial historian to some).  What's worse, many who see the film and  are impressed with its claims of &quot;this is how it really was&quot; will  walk away misinformed but convinced they know the truth.  None of the  historical flaws of the film are fatal in and of themselves.  After all,  most American war films take gross liberties with the facts for the sake of  story.  When war films do strive to get the facts exactly right, the result  is often wooden (Midway), so directors are to be excused for taking some  license.  But as I stated before, if Spielberg is going to set the bar  higher for his movie's sake, he has to be prepared to be judged by a higher  standard.Take the famous opening battle scene.  Viewers are left with  the impression that the first wave of infantry (under Hanks's leadership)  secured Dog Green in about 20 minutes of fighting.  Blow up some concertina  wire, pick off a single machinegun nest using a sniper, and suddenly the  whole beach's defenses crumble to the point where Tom Sizemore's Sgt  Horvath has the time and security to gather French dust into a can as a  souvenier.  In truth, the first waves (and second, third, etc) did little  on D Day morning except cower below the seawalls for several hours.  There  were certainly officers like Hanks's Cpt. Miller present that day, and  through simple dogged courage they did force open the draws under heavy  fire.  However, Spielberg wants it both ways here.  He wants to show Cpt.  Miller's company hitting the beach first, but he also wants it to be the  company (now a short platoon due to attrition) that singlehandedly secures  the heights.  In reality these two things didn't coincide on Omaha.  The  result is the viewer is left with the impression that sure, there were some  horrific casualties, but &quot;our boys&quot; gathered themselves quickly  and knocked out those German positions in time for an early lunch. This is  jingoism more fit for a John Wayne epic than one supervised by a respected  historian (though jingoism is a rap on Ambrose from some circles).Another moment, even more hard to swallow, comes halfway through the  picture when Miller orders his squad of six to help him reduce a German  machinegun nest that guards a radar site.  Now the wisdom of this, given  the squad's mission, can be debated. But the main flaw of this scene is the  complete lack of small-unit tactics.  Miller fails to scout the area to the  flanks to see if other guns or troops are supporting the nest.  He simply  assumes the machinegun is alone. He fails to deploy his supersniper Jackson  into one of the numerous trees in the area to pick off the three gunners  from a distance even though this is the tactic he used in the beach scene  where it made much less sense.  He fails to even consider moving around the  flanks to a better assault position.  Instead, he immediately decides on a  blind three-man charge into the teeth of the position - probably the single  stupidist tactic one could come up with given the situation.  Luckily the  German gunners, despite being behind sandbags and armed with the  superlative MG-42 machinegun, seem to have been trained at the Stars Wars  Stormtrooper School of Marksmanship and they only manage to kill one of the  squad's members before they are despatched themselves.  Incredibly, after  the action is over, despite the fact the squad is ten miles behind enemy  lines and near an installation the Germans are obviously guarding, the men  make no effort to adopt a defensive posture nor scout the surrounding area  for other troops who may have heard the firefight and start coming to  investigate.  Instead, Miller heads off to a hillside alone to dramatically  cry while his men mill about and smoke cigarettes.  No wonder we liberated  France so quickly, the film seems to say - there were only three Germans  every five square miles defending it.  It's hard to imagine anyone who has  experienced actual small-arms combat viewing this scene and concluding that  Cpt Miller knows a thing about leading infantry.  Yet, we were told that  this is &quot;how it was&quot;, so I guess it must have been just that  easy. ...............	4.0	Gripping but inaccurate	2000-08-20	32	23	9
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2VGKGXSG81KAS	Michael J. Berquist	There are great movies and then there are *GREAT* movies, movies that touch you in a deeply personal way. &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is a GREAT movie, a movie that left me in tears afterwards.Why is this such a  brilliant movie? Where to begin? The direction by Steven Spielberg is  magnificent. The opening 40 minutes of the movie, the bloody U.S. landing  on Omaha Beach, is a stunning experience. Bullets whiz by, soldiers die and  it feels like you are right there!The acting is right on as well- Tom  Hanks as Capt. Miller, the squad leader, is nothing short of brilliant. He  effortlessly captures the spirit of the men who went abroad to fight- the  guy who had a regular job back in the States and just wanted to do his duty  and get back to it. I find it hard to believe Hanks didn't win an Oscar for  this.The music by John Williams is perfect- subtle and emotionally  heartfelt. But the story is what really works- this isn't a war movie about  blowing up a bridge, or stealing information. This is a war movie about how  awful war is. The men aren't on a mission to kill. They are on the mission  to save a life.One of the finest movies I have ever seen in my life.  Those who loved this movie as deeply as I would be interested in reading  Tom Brokaw's &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; or Stephen Ambrose  &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;. I recommend both.	5.0	The word &quot;Brillant&quot; is not strong enough . . .	2000-02-02	5	2	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1W9K1QJS04TFU	"Michael J. Brett ""Michael Brett"""	This is an interesting film but marred in all sorts of funny ways: yukky setimentality intrudes and damages what could have been a very great film.The opening sequence is based on a similar one in a German film called Stalingrad, and has great impact. When the film came out, this is what impressed people, along with its apparent realism.Wouldn't it have been a great film if Private Ryan himself had not been much worth saving? He is presented as an heroic figure when we first see him, holding a bazooka. But supposing he had been crying and hiding behind a tree? That would have, perhaps, have said more about the nature of war, fate and taking orders.When hundreds of dead American troops are shown lying dead in the surf, there is a musical soundtrack, an orchestra in a minor key. Why? Surely, the sight of hundreds of young men lying dead on a beach is melancholy enough.Why was it set in the present, with the body of the film as a flashback? I could not see the purpose to trying to anchor it in the present, in some way.No disrespect to anyone, but why is it that whenever we see a US flag, or hear the mention of someone like President Lincoln, an orchestra always starts to play? It has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.	3.0	A strange film in many ways.	2008-10-09	7	3	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; tells the story of a United States Army captain (played by Tom Hanks) who, during World War II, is sent on a special mission in Europe: he and his team are to find and bring home a young soldier named Private Ryan. Ryan's brothers have been killed fighting the war, making him the last surviving son in the family; the U.S. government thus wants him pulled out of the combat zone.Unlike some other war films, SPR includes no love story subplots; this is all about men at war. The combat scenes are brutally intense and graphic. But the violence is never gratuitous or glamorized. Rather, the violent scenes play like a documentary whose maker is intent on showing the terror and pain of war.Steven Spielberg directs an excellent ensemble cast. Hanks brings a quiet, anguished dignity to his role as Captain Miller. The rest of the cast does equally admirable work.The quest of Captain Miller and his squad involves both an internal and external struggle; they must fight enemy troops while struggling to stay in touch with their own humanity. The film raises such issues as loyalty, duty, the treatment of enemy prisoners, and the value of a single life in the midst of overwhelming death.While the film clearly empathizes with Hanks' American soldiers, it does not demonize the Germans, and does not indulge in jingoistic imagery or rhetoric. In the end, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is a well-made film that is often disturbing, often moving, but always attentive to high human cost of war.	5.0	A new standard for war films	2001-06-04	38	32	6

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3GWOG9X9ZOA7A	Michael Navratil (mdnav@hotmail.com)	I hate to write a negative review, but given the amount of &quot;5-star&quot; reviews I've seen for this movie, I couldn't resist...First, the positive.  I think there were some well shot scenes  in this movie.  Obviously, the landing at Normandy was one of them...I even  liked the scene where the soldiers were going through the dog tags in front  of the other soldiers (as trite as that scene was, it worked well in the  movie).  Even overall, I'll admit, the film was &quot;entertaining and  emotional.&quot;  But it was NOT one of the greatest war movies ever  made.Now, to the negative.  I already used the word, but  &quot;trite&quot; is the best adjective to define the story, acting, and  symbolism (what little there was).  The story belongs in a Stallone or  Lundgren movie (where have we seen the band of soldiers going into enemy  territory to find the missing soldiers before?  The only thing missing from  this movie was Tom Hanks looking at the Germans and saying, &quot;I'll be  back.&quot;).It's difficult not to compare, but if you're looking for  a &quot;war movie,&quot; and not an action sitcom, you should really look  at &quot;The Thin Red Line.&quot;  Those who reviewed SPR with &quot;4 and  5-stars&quot; will tell you that it's &quot;boring,&quot; that they  &quot;just didn't get it,&quot;  and (my favorite) &quot;it had no  story.&quot;  But as a movie, Saving Private Ryan is no match for a true  war movie.  In the first 5 minutes of The Thin Red Line, there is more  depth, substance, and thought provoking material than in the entire film of  SPR.  Also, while I'm comparing the two films, compare the number of  &quot;sitcom actors&quot; in SPR (and Sorry folks, Tom Hanks is a  &quot;sitcom actor&quot;) with the number of &quot;film&quot; actors in The  Thin Red Line.  Not that sitcom acting is bad, but I think &quot;film  actors&quot; are generally better actors than sitcom actors.  But I  digress...In sum,if you don't like to think when you watch movies, and  if you want stories spoon fed to you, then Saving Private Ryan is &quot;a  true masterpiece.&quot;(On this point, I would also like to add that  just because a movie makes you &quot;feel good&quot; does not mean that  it's a great movie.)However, if by some chance that you demand something  more, or are looking for a &quot;great war movie,&quot; then you should  really look elsewhere because this movie doesn't even come close...	1.0	&quot;Spielberg Masterpiece&quot; is an oxymoron.	1999-10-23	52	19	33

In order to show something as realistic as possible, having violence portrayed in such an awful way is necessary.  So people who see the film as too violent feel it shouldn't be as realistic?  Why the heck not?  The violence in this film isn't &quot;cool&quot; or enjoyable to watch.  This film is great for many reasons, technical and dramatic.

On the beach, listen for the sound of bullets hitting the beach obstacles and the distinctive &quot;ting&quot; as the empty clip is ejected from the M-1 rifles.More importantly, they captured the feel of the approaching tanks.  You feel tanks before you hear them, and the sound guys got that.  Amazing.The extras are a good addition to DVD, and are one of the reasons I lve this medium.A wonderful film.	5.0	Where did we find men such as these?	2001-10-09	4	4	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AHJ4CB7OIWU4K	Michael Simpson	I'm not sure there's anything I can add to what others have written about this movie. The first 15 minutes of it are incredible, and men I know who have been in war, are truly terrified by what they see. I swear I don't breathe every time I watch Captain Miller's company charge the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.Little things about the movie have always impressed me. Many of the actors have that gaunt look of 1940's Americans, that is, very thin. Barry Pepper still stands out to me in his role as Private Jackson, with his sharpshooter skills derived from many of the legends of the US Military.I have watched this movie literally 50 times over the past 15 years. I had it on DVD (yes, bought from Amazon in the late 90's), and I had to have it on BluRay. A lot of times, BluRay versions are basically the same as DVD with better sound, and of course, HD&#8211;both of which were worth it to me. Watching the movie on BluRay was such a wonderful improvement, but the goriness was certainly more &#34;in your face.&#34; The BluRay version had a couple of things that I didn't have on my DVD, but then again my DVD of the movie is quite ancient.There is no commentary by the Director Steven Spielberg. That's disappointing, but that's his policy. In addition, the extras (except for a couple of trailers) are all in standard DVD definition.Also, there is no Digital Copy that you can save to iTunes or other movie management system. This is disappointing, as I watch movies on my computer and iPad, so I wish I had it. I'll have to buy the digital version eventually.Anyways, this is a great movie, probably the best war movie of our generation (though there is a lot of competition). The BluRay version makes it better.	5.0	One of the great movies of our time	2014-03-13	0	0	0

You can't help not feeling  absolutely grief-stricken after watching this film.This film is not  about a plot, but about war itself. (Full Metal Jacket was similar in this  way.) It's about how war is de-humanizing and downright horrific. For a  more character-driven play, see The Thin Red Line (it's a very different  beast from SPR, but also highly recommended).As for being the best WWII  film ever, it is not. That title belongs to Schindler's List. While not  being directly about the war, it shows us the Holocaust with more honesty  than we have ever seen or ever will see. The gross brutality of WWII did  not primarily lie with the actual combat, but with Nazis in regards to the  innocent citizens of the occupied countries.	5.0	The *second* greatest WWII film I have ever seen	1999-10-27	1	1	0

The way the colors are sort of drab and drowned out is amazing. It gives you a sense of being there. I think about this movie a lot lately. I dunno why, but I always want to put it in. I pray that someone makes something close to how good this is some day. I feel like we've reached the top and there's no place left but down.

When I saw this film, it made me realize that war is a horrible thing.A beautiful and  stunning tribute to the heroes of WWII, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;  will affect you deeply.  Its real strength is introducing characters that  you really care about and identify with.  So many other war movies, even  good ones like &quot;Platoon&quot; have cliched characters and stereotyped  solders.  This film puts YOU in the shoes of the fighting men- and that is  the most frightening and effective part of all.  I remember leaving the  theater after seeing it for the first time thinking &quot;how did they do  it? &quot;  I found it amazing that these men had the courage to do what  they did.Tom Hanks is at his usual best as the main character, and Matt  Damon shines as well.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A16EZ4MT9BFF2R	Mike Murray	This is not an easy film to watch. Clearly, that was not its intent.The story begins in current time at the Normandy American Cemetary in France. An elderly man, followed by his family, walks as if compelled  toward a single grave. When he arrives there, his memory takes a different  journey back to the beaches below on the date, 6 June 1944.From this  moment on, especially for the ensuing 25 minutes, we are thrust into a  story that, if it is hard to view, must certainly have been harder to live.  As the troop transports approach Omaha Beach, the eerie sense of calm gives  way to a landscape that when all is said and done is one of the most  powerful statements ever put on film.When all is said and done, two  brothers surnamed Ryan have died on the beaches of Normandy. Another has  died within a week in the Pacific. It is discovered that a sole surviving  brother has parachuted somewhere in France. It is the assignment of a  survivor of Normandy and his platoon to find this brother and return him  home.Director Steven Spielberg is a master at bringing emotion to the  surface and he does it once again with a film which is gut-wrenching.  However, the movie isn't all blood and gore; it's the story of young men  and boys who fought and died to preserve a way of life and to eliminate the  evil that they saw.Tom Hanks heads the cast as Capt. John Miller, the  man who is given the mission to find Pvt. Ryan and bring him home. In one  sense, it works against the film to know that Matt Damon plays Pvt. James  Ryan, but not so much that you can't appreciate the nuances which Miller  and his platoon come up against time and time again during their  mission.I agree with those who say that Spielberg puts us, his audience,  into the film and sweeps us up and carries us along from the opening  moments until the film's end. It is a masterful piece of filmmaking that  makes us feel that we have survived, although we were never in  danger.Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.	5.0	The greatest war film of all time!	1999-12-19	8	6	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3EIILPV6LMY0K	Mike T.	I should start this review by saying that Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies so I have a biased opinion.I won't get into the specifics of the movie because many people before me have done a fantastic job of that.What I loved about this movie is that it didn't make war look glamorous or desirable.  It showed how terrible war could be and the reality of what really happens.  After a huge battle or conflict you could actually see on the actors faces that they were scared and shaken.  Of course the down side for some people is there is very violent scenes that could offend some viewers.  The first 20 minutes of the invasion scene is brutal and very realistic.  The first time that I watched the first scenes it hit me kind of hard and I never realized what those brave men must have felt or went through.The main story line involves the saving of one soldier who actually doesn't enter the movie until mid-stream.  What I love about Steven Speilbergs movies is that he lets you get to know the characters.  All of the actors do a great job and are very credible and act like soldiers.If you can get past the graphic scenes in the beginning of the movie it tones down some.  I highly recommend this movie!	5.0	Like being there	2001-01-07	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1IKD6BDEE18CI	"mirope ""mirope"""	I think you have to rate this movie on two different criteria.  First, how realistically does it portray D-Day and the fighting in Normandy?  Here, it is unparalleled and a remarkable feat of film making.  The D-Day invasion sequence is the most powerful 20 minutes of film, ever.  All of Speilberg's choices - the handheld cameras, the chaotic action, the sound effects and the painfully graphic gore - couldn't be better.  Short of going back in time and filming the first wave landing on Omaha Beach, I don't know how it could be any more realistic.  The squad's subsequent journey through Normandy to find Private Ryan is also very good.  There is a real sense of how scattered the American troopers (esp. the airborne) were, and how isolated they were because of the lack of reliable communications between the pockets of soldiers.Setting aside the issue of how accurately the film portrays the fighting, is it a good movie?  Here, my answer is a slightly less enthusiastic &quot;yes&quot;.  Tom Hanks couldn't be better.  Low-key but has clearly earned the respect of his men.  The burdens of command are a little over done - the speech in the church about justifying sending men to their death was like being hit over the head with a hammer.  Hanks' acting alone conveyed this point; the speech wasn't necessary.  The supporting cast was also great.  I particularly liked the sniper.  By and large the plot is a good one, but I have to agree with those who felt like the ending was a little too predictable and &quot;Hollywood&quot;.  Nevertheless, this is a powerful movie, and one everyone should see at least once.The DVD special features were very slick.  I particularly enjoyed &quot;Into the Breach&quot; - a sort of &quot;Making of SPR.&quot;  The production notes were also very interesting, and the cast bios are some of the most complete I've seen on DVDs.

War is not pretty and it this movie does an awesome job of helping people understand what soldiers  have to go through. I loved this movie. There wasn't extensive dialouge,  however the dialogue was powerful. The acting was incredible, by all. The  picture and editing was also top notch. The movie gives you the sense of  steping in someone's shoes who has fought war. Also it shows how families  deal with war. Everyone should see this movie young and old. After watching  it, it will either provoke memories for some or help those, without  memories, understand in a deeper way.	5.0	Very enlightening, educating, sad, and real	1999-12-08	6	4	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1AFXJ8U72MD6L	"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie"""	SPR has got to be one of the best and most realistic WWII movie I have ever seen in regards to what the bloodshed was really like and the confusion some people felt over it.For the record, I've seen over 50 WWII movies.Don't expect a jingoistic or patriotic story.  There's a lot of grayness in the characters and some of the Germans aren't necessarily evil people or noble.Interesting, gritty and bloody war scenes.  Lots of the characters die so it isn't the typical movie where the heroes all come out alive and smiling.Themes of duty, the needs of one person over many and even patriotism apply to this story.TOP FIVE SCENES:(1) Omaha Beach assault; a good 15 minutes and not at all like anything you have seen in the old WWII shows;(2) the ending when a small group tries to distract a larger German unit in a French town;(3) whether to spare the life of a begging German soldier;(4) Tom Hanks telling them about his true occupation which was a big mystery; and(5) Private Ryan's story about his brothers and the barn with the girl.	5.0	Should have won best film over SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE	2001-03-30	6	1	5
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2TPPTGR4DIRL0	Mitch Clifford	"First off, everything you may have heard about the opening Normandy sequence is true: this is quite simply the most amazing battle re-creation footage you're ever likely to see. Definitely not for the squeamish, it paints its horrifying portrait without ever allowing the viewer to glory in any kind of ""excitement"" (which most battle simulations end up doing on some level, even the well-meaning ones). Spielberg uses every ounce of his talent and ingenuity to show combat the way it should be shown: as pure Hell, a nightmare that it is impossible to waken from.  As for the rest of the movie which follows this opening sequence. . . well, I'm not sure. The first time I saw it, I was caught up from the beginning and the rest of the film seemed to hold me equally well. But upon further viewings, the flimsiness and basic illogic of the central plot become far more noticeable. I don't know, it's a toss-up. There are still several compelling scenes here, and Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career (his ""dramatic"" career anyway - I'm one who still believes there's much to be said for Tom's earlier work in comedy) but there just seems to be an overall ""falseness"" in the structure that undercuts some of the film's power. I wish a better framing story could have been found.  But by all means see this movie. Warts and all, it's the kind that only a truly great director could make - and the opening alone is worth the cost. Just don't expect a masterpiece; think of it more as a flawed gem."	5.0	A flawed gem	2008-09-23	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3L5YSFG9WGS22	MLH - The Online Movie Critic	D-Day, June 6th 1944 the Allied invasion of France was the largest amphibious landing of World War II. The operation name for D-Day was  Operation:Overlord, this operation consisted of attacks on the Germans from  every aspect. The Army, Navy, and the Air Force worked together to make the  outcome of the operation, a victory for the allies. Saving Private Ryan  begins at the most deadly beach out of the five, Omaha beach. The other  four beaches were Utah which was assigned to the US, Gold, Juno, and Sword  these three belonged to the British and a Canadian Army. The depiction of  Omaha in this movie shows you what it must have been like. After the  beginning Captain Miller a US Army Ranger (Hanks) is assigned to lead eight  men to save one man, Pvt. James Ryan so that he may go home to ease his  mothers suffering. You may be wondering why they have to save Pvt. Ryan to  ease Ryan's mother's suffering, it is because his other three brothers have  been killed in action and he is the only one out of the four left. The  battle scenes are incredible and so is the movie overall. Though you hear  the Sullivan boys mentioned in the movie they actually got the idea on  another group of brothers. Tom Hanks stars as Captain Miller, Tom Sizemore  plays a sergeant under Miller, and Matt Damon as Pvt. Ryan. The Special  Limited Edition of this movie also features a bonus tape, which contains  some interviews with D-Day veterans and author Stephen E. Ambrose and some  facts on D-Day. It also shows a little bit on two of Spielberg's movies  that he made when he was a child, Escape To Nowhere and Fighter Squadron. I  also recommend the great 1962 film on D-Day, The Longest Day.	5.0	A Tribute To Veterans And Spielberg's Best	2000-08-20	3	2	1

I know too little about the politics of Hollywood to guess why this happens "" studio pressure? US vs. European film culture? Still, its miles better than the former D-Day benchmark movie, The Longest Day, and shows the sheer scope and depth of Spielbergs vision. Nothing wrong with the acting performances either, with Tom Hanks as always superb and ably supported by a cast of young actors (bizarrely, some last seen on TV sitcom Friends).

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1SCD2NYTIAQTY	Mouldy Pilgrim	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is a movie that is truly epic in scale and stars a huge array of big names, some of whom became even bigger after the film, (eg. Vin Diesel).The film opens with the harrowing D-Day landings, following Captain Miller and his men. The unit is given the mission of finding and getting Private James Ryan out of the war. His 3 brothers have all been killed and it has been decided that 3 or 4 sons is enough sacrifice for one mother to make.A lot of the depth of the movie comes with the relationships between Miller and those around him. There are some truly light hearted moments, such as the pool that is running to find out what Miller did before the war. However, a lot is very deep and touches on some issues that other movies seem to gloss over. One is a conversation in which Miller mentions that over 90 men have died under his command and the way in which he copes with that personally.The movie does not glorify war, but shows it in its hideous randomness and brutality. Though there a more violent films out there, such asWe Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition), ""Saving Private Ryan"" definitely does not gloss over anything.This is a profoundly moving movie, and one that I have seen more than once.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2H79GB6TP9E6K	Movie Buff	"I was completely blown away by ""Saving Private Ryan."" Spielberg, who (with the exception of ""Schindler's List"") only made warm entertainment before this, went against his usual ethics with this war film. And he succeeded.""Saving Private Ryan,"" is without question one of the finest war movies ever made--possibly one of the finest movies ever. You don't really watch this film; you experience war, first-hand. The much-talked about scene, the Allied assault on Omaha Beach, is indeed extraordinarily brutal scene to watch, yet it is also mesmerizing at the same time.The film follows a squad of U.S. soldiers on their PR mission to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers were all killed in combat. The squad is led by (Tom Hanks), a soldier's soldier, but all around a pretty good guy. The squad is portrayed by such actors as Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies in a superb role as the terrified translator.The acting is very good all around. Hanks received an Oscar nomination, but the rest of the cast is excellent, most notably Davies and Edward Burns.I was shocked that ""Saving Private Ryan"" didn't win Best Picture. It was one of the Academy's most shamefull moments. Luckily, Spielberg won for Best Director. It also won for Cinematography, which was basically all hand-held during the battle scenes. This worked wonders; it almost looked as though I was watching a documentary. The violence is extremely difficult to watch, but it worked for the film. Usually I have a problem with over-the-top violence (""Cliffhanger,"" anyone?), but I didn't mind it here. Spielberg was trying to make a point about war, and he definitely pulled it off, and then some. The film runs at nearly three hours, and yet I was completely fascinated the entire time. That is indeed a rare thing. I strongly recommend ""Saving Private Ryan."""	5.0	A mind-numbing assault on the senses.	2004-10-21	8	7	1

The movie is graphic by necessity.  Anything less would insult  those who fought, as if by diminishing the horror we would diminish their  sacrifice.The film provides a glimpse into the hell that is war.  But,  it not so much condemns war as exalts the men who fought, died, or survived  only to be haunted by their experiences.As filmmaking, the movie is  unsurpassed.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ	Mr. A. Pomeroy	If there had been any doubts about Steven Speilberg's status as one of the finest motion picture creators ever ('The Lost World' had given his reputation as a popular entertainer a knock, and many people were  forgetting 'Schindler's List'), 'Saving Private Ryan' squashed them. 'Ryan'  took a simple story and turned it into something extraordinary, both an  unflinching look at the random slaughter of warfare, and a portrait of  ordinary people voluntarily stuck in an unimaginably inhuman situation,  with solid acting from an odd cast. Tiny segments remain in the memory long  after the film is over, and the final half-hour strikes an extremely  precise balance between being exciting and utterly terrifying. At the  cinema in which I saw it, the audience were silent as the credits rolled,  and filed out as if stunned.Trying to separate its status as a  historical document from its status as entertainment is tricky. A film  about a significant subject is not, in itself, unassailable, but as with  'Schindler's List' this it not just a film about momentous events, it's a  great film about momentous events. In retrospect, the middle segment seems  to drag on too long, but without it the film would be unbearably intense,  and that's all I can think to say against it.It seems obscene that  'Saving Private Ryan' lost out to the trifling 'Shakespeare in Love' for  the Best Picture Academy Award.On DVD it's excellent - the picture and  sound quality are superb, and the short 'Making of' featurette should,  uniquely, have gone on for much longer.	5.0	Zing	2000-07-10	4	2	2

We are thankful to have won. We never thought to find glory in it only death, and fought it anyway.

Speilberg and Hanks have done us all a favor and created a film that will stay with you for a long time. Although it's not a true story, it's based on a similar situation that occurred during the Civil War. The violence and destruction is realistic, the acting is perfect (and the actors are cast perfectly) and watching it on  blu-ray on a large screen hi-def with big audio will simply rivet you to the story.  One other benefit of watching this movie to me...my respect and admiration for the rapidly disappearing generation of heroes that went to that terrible war, of which I know many that live here in my hometown, has been multiplied about a thousand times.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2469QZ4PW4H0V	"M. Wiese ""infallablecritic"""	"Saving Private Ryan is a great war film. The combat and violence is staggering and difficult to watch at times, but it does prove how horrific the battles were. As I said, I admire ""Ryan"" for its realism of war, but as for characters, I didnt find it that appealing. It seemed like the characters just werent developed enough. It probably was not like this at all in real life, but it seems that in the movie the soldiers were automatically made out to be complete ignorant jerks to each other. For example, the medic shouts out in the middle of the Omaha invasion(I think it was Omaha) why the Germans arent giving them a chance? Well, are you going to give them a chance?..........Then one soldier tries to emphasize the importance of brotherhood in war and that the men should care about each other, and the soldiers just laugh at him and make fun of him for it, but when their two men get killed, all of a sudden they are so sensitive and compassionate and decide to use that to intimidate Private Ryan when he refused to leave the squad.Saving Private Ryan is a great drama and war film, but if you are looking for better developed characters in a war film, try Platoon.How could ""Ryan"" get Best Director Oscar but not Best Picture?"	5.0	Good war film	2005-10-25	6	3	3

It's like comparing a fruit to a vegtable.  Saving  Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made, if not the best.  For  those who say look at Full Medal Jacket, I also feel sorry for you.  Kubrick, perhaps the best director of all time, did make a great film, I  love Full Medal Jacket, but that movie does not catch the horrors of war,  but instead the individual experience of training and the effects of war on  man.  They are both good films, but Saving Private Ryan is a better war  film.  I also would like to say that The Thin Red Line is also a fine  picture.  That movie is more difficult to comprehend, but after multiple  viewings, it does show its true self.  It is a great movie, about the  effects of war on men, and how they see it, while they are in the heat of  it.  And how they long for something great, something we all take for  granted these days.

Nothing can prepare you for the realism of the violence in this picture, and while parts of it may be graphic at times, it is necessary and fits well in to the film.I recommend buying the commerative D-Day 60th anniversary addition for all the special features and informative documentaries. I had seen this movie many times before I bought it, and learned so much about the battle of Normandy and facts about the film from the special features on disc 2. The boot camp for the cast was most interesting, especially the fact that all the cast were put into boot camp except for Matt Damon, so the rest of the cast would resent him as they do in the movie.Everybody should own this movie, it is a history lesson and and cinematic masterpiece at the same time. Excellent viewing.	5.0	Excellent viewing	2007-01-07	7	2	5
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A38UU6R3QFNN4Z	Nathanial Dupont	When Saving Private Ryan arrived at my house I was baffled by the empty envelope stuffed in my mailbox. Where is my movie?A disappointing situation, someone just scored a free bluray (congratulations by the way, you probably don't even know what bluray is) and now I have to pay to get another. I thought. Well after reaching Amazon by telephone, the lady on the line apologized and assured me they would take care of me at no charge. She even over-nighted my new copy so I didn't have to wait. I couldn't be happier with the customer service for resolving this issue so gracefully.The movie of course is great. If you haven't seen it yet, you've only had 15 years to watch it, and you ought to pick it up as soon as possible. It's an incredibly deep and moving look into the lives of soldiers and the horrors they had to endure during World War II, as well as the comradery and affection for eachother that develops through such harsh trials and uplifting victories. Seriously. Check it out. On bluray.If you know what it is.	5.0	Stolen the first time, but Amazon had my back.	2013-02-26	0	0	0

The product that I purchased was in good condition. The case resembles a war journal, which adds more excitement, rather than just a plan and simple case. The only minor issue that I had when this shipment was finally delivered to me, was that one of the discs were loose and received a couple of scratches from the delivery. Luckily it still works good.

The graininess of the film is spot on to give you that war-time feel and I never thought I would talk about them, but the special features are just as great as the movie itself! You get to see the making of the movie and what the actors actually had to go through. Overall this is an amazing movie and it is a completely different experience on Blu-ray, if you have a good sound system and a Blu-ray player then this is something that will really show it off.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1P0GK24NGMRTL	NJC	Why is it that we give this man Academy Awards? When I was young I loved Spielberg but now I can't stand him. He is insincere. He is a tear-jerking manipulator only, without subtlety or understanding. I left this movie  thinking, finally, people will realize that this man is all gee whiz and no  substance. All Spielberg knows, besides technical wizardry (which is  ultimately boring because not character driven) is melodrama and bathos. He  knows nothing of honest drama and pathos. He actually WAVES THE FLAG at the  ending of this movie! It's like a cartoon or professional wrestling, I  swear. Have I been taken to another planet or something, or are we in a new  Dark Ages? Has Spielberg ever actually read a book? Grow up, for the love  of Man! This man-child studio mogul is not an artist and should go back to  making adventure movies like &quot;Jaws&quot; or &quot;Duel&quot; and leave  history to people without box office and Oscar-collecting agendas. Shame,  Mr. Spielberg. Shame. Come on people, if it's an easy, agreeable answer  then someone is trying to sell you something. Buy something else, if you  want my opinion. Stephen Spielberg is primarily a salesman, only  insterested in a buck or power or status, and not in communication. This is  a very bad movie.	2.0	Emotion is not thought.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1TRWW665ACYQ3	n.m.	"I must admit, Steven Spielberg is not my cup of tea. I find his films to be shallow, mainstream, and too much about America. I have a problem with the way he tells his films. Spielberg always has to exploit the emotional moments of a film and push it so far that it ends up being embarrassing and laughable (Like the end of SCHINDLER'S LIST or when Private Ryan salutes the tombstone at the end of this film). I also dislike the ""Spielbergian close-ups"". Why does he always have to shove the camera up the actor's face? For the most part, SCHINDLER'S LIST is the one exception. Its documentary approach to telling its story helped Spielberg to stay clear of his usual blunders (At least until the end of the film, when Spielberg could no longer control himself). SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is just one long testament to America as a nation. The film opens with the American flag. It depicts the story of a small group of American soldiers defeating the more numerous Germans. The latter is depicted as a faceless crowd, except for the one German soldier who is completely humiliated in a scene with the American soldiers, and ends up begging for his life. Spielberg is passing judgement on history, and that is a very dangerous thing to do. Has he ever asked himself what he would have done if he were an eighteen year-old German lad when the war broke out? Would he have belonged to the minority who opposed the Nazi rule? Most likely not. Most people wouldn't. We also have the scene with the French family begging the Americans for help. Europeans are also humiliated in this film. The invasion-scene is impressive. I'll admit that. But this is only 30 minutes out of a film that runs for almost three hours. And people who hail the film can't seem to find anything to talk about except for those thirty minutes. After the invasion-scene the film falls flat on its belly, because there is nothing of interest in it. There is nothing in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN we didn't already know. People have hailed the realism of the film, and sure, the violence of the film seems to be very realistic. But I for one didn't need to see a film like this to understand that war is bloody. Perhaps that's necessary for people who watch too much CNN? America has a tendency to forget that the bombs they drop actually kill people. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN provokes me. It provokes me because it has turned World War 2 into a clash between America and Germany. It's reductionism at its worst. It's what renowned peace researcher Johan Galtung would call war journalism; the tendency of western media to reduce any conflict into an image of only two parties opposing each other. I don't mean to undermine the role that America played in achieving allied victory. But Spielberg certainly intends to undermine the role Europe played in achieving allied victory.I think it's important for a war film to show us the individuals it depicts. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN never managed to do that. It's not enough having Tom Hanks shake is hand a little to show us that he's falling a part. APOCALYPSE NOW was a momentous war film. It depicted the breaking down of the individual and the madness of the mind (Something THE THIN RED LINE also attempted at, but never fully managed). BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is another example of a great war film. It focuses on the paradox of man during war. PLATOON and BORN ON THE 4th OF JULY are two of Oliver Stone's (Or should it be Oliver Stoned?) best films. DAS BOOT is perhaps the greatest war film ever made. Wolfgang Petersen threw the ideologies that roamed the surface overboard (Without, as a German, denying history), and focused on the crew and what they were fighting for; Survival. Thus DAS BOOT became a film about individuals rather than nations. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN ends up being too much about America (The only nation to ever be charged and convicted with terrorism by an international court of Law), to be a film about individuals."	2.0	grand scale war drama with nothing to say except hail Ameria	2001-11-24	13	9	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	As an amateur WWII historian, this movie was a rare and wonderful opportunity to peek into the past and get a realistic glimpse of what D-Day was like for those on Omaha Beach. Spielberg does a masterful job of portraying the unbridled horror of the beach assault, which in itself is a must-see for every American. It's a great reminder of the price which has been paid to preserve basic human liberties.From a historical perspective, it was great to see the director's attention to some minute details for the sake of authenticity. The uniforms, the equipment and the general tenor of the movie were indeed realistic and convincing. No doubt a great deal of research went into this production.I only give it four stars, however, because in other historical areas, it is lacking. The main example is the depiction of the first wave on Omaha managing to not only get off the beach but clear the German defenses. This simply did not happen in reality. Additionally, the general story line, although based loosely on a true account, was given an ample dose of &quot;Hollywood,&quot; and thus was a little weaker from a historical perspective than I would have liked.Nevertheless, the overall movie experience is, in my opinion, better than any other for depicting D-Day in all its awfulness. Well done, Mr. Spielberg.	4.0	A glimpse into history. Cannot recommend too highly.	2001-09-20	1	0	1

When orders mean being part of something that  seems insane but becomes something honorable and noble.  The viewer  witnesses mans struggle with self, pride, trust, and loss.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ACMOLKXVKQ06Z	N. Schoenfeld	"This film is a horrific vision of World War II. The movie involves one mans mission to retrieve a soldier from combat. The soldier's name is Private John F. Ryan. Private Ryan has three other brothers who are also in  combat, unfortunately they were killed in action. Since Private Ryan is the  only one left of the four brothers, the General orders that he is retrieved  off the front line and brought home to his family. This is surprising,  because usually the Army will not go out of the way to retrieve one single  man. One soldier is chosen to lead six men into battle to retrieve Private  Ryan.  At the beginning of the film, director Steven Speilberg takes us  to the front line.  The first twenty minutes of the film consists of the  Americans invading Omaha Beach at Normandy. As we watch this part of the  movie, we are almost thrown into the battle with the help of up close and  personal camera shots and movement. This part of the movie, as well as the  rest of the movie, is notorious for its ultra realism. In World War II,  that means some serious violence. We are forced to watch people die. There  are some quick shots of death, but we are also forced to watch some very  painful shots. Most movies would show a quick painful death. Speilberg does  something more, he makes us watch characters we love and grow to know, die  slowly, painfully, and with emphasis on realism. Showing this gives movie  patrons a shell shock of realism and emotion, and it's hard to find a movie  that can do that to us.  If one can make it through the first twenty  minutes of the film, he or she is on an emotional journey that will never  be forgotten. After the last of Private Ryan's three brothers dies at Omaha  Beach, the search for Private Ryan begins. We are now given the opportunity  to meat the team that is sent off to save Private Ryan. Led by actor Tom  Hanks, the team sets out with a controversial mission to save someone they  don't even know. The reason this is controversial is because in war,  soldiers are resources, and risking the life of seven men to save one, is  illogical. The movie puts that aside and brings a glimmer of morals into  the war. Although some of the team disagrees on the purpose of this  mission, they know that they have a mission to do and must follow it. When  asked ""How do you choose between the mission and the man"", Tom Hanks  replies, ""This time the mission is a man.""  This movie has excellent  character development. The team of six people is introduced to us well, and  the characters are written wonderfully. Everyone on the team has an  original personality. As the movie progresses, we grow to like a single  character one at a time. Just when we start to like the character and want  to know more about him, he is killed in action. Since we are forced to  watch a slow, painful, and gruesome death, this is a great loss to us, and  an emotional shock. Since this is war, we can't expect everyone to live.  But still, we are hurt when they die. Then about two thirds through the  movie, we meet Private Ryan.  At first, Private Ryan is reluctant to go  with the team.  Later, he realizes what the team has gone through to bring  him back and decides to go with them.  This movie is a serious roller  coaster ride for mature audiences.  For three hours, we watch war, people  die, and the bond between soldiers. By the end of the movie, the people in  the audience who aren't crying, are speechless. No other war movie has been  so realistic. People who say the movie is too realistic are scared of the  truth, or an oxymoron. Something is either realistic or not, without  realism people are disillusioned. Censorship is a bad thing. War is war, if  your scared of the truth, don't see it. This movie just dodged an NC-17  rating for just violence and realism. Speilberg is a wonderful director for  taking us on such a journey without compromise."	5.0	Excellent in every way.	2000-07-02	1	1	0

I cannot bare to wctch it more than once every year or two, it is simply too hard of a moie to see.  It is superb, exquisite and extremely well acted.  The landing, done on an Irush beach, looked ery much like the znormandy of June 1944.  I think the camera work of janusz Kaminski is the finest action achievement of all time.  You are there, that's all there is to it.  You LAND WITH THESE MEN,M, YOU RQACE FOR YOUR LIFE FOR THE SHINGLE, THE LOW WALL OF SAND  PROTECTING THE TOP OF YOUR HELMUT, IF EEN THAT, AND YOU PRAY TO GOD, SHAKING UINCONTROLABLELY IN FEAR.  Yoy\u are sure that you will not survive and your family's faces suddenly appear to you, in your imagination.  There is no one there to call this madness off.  You begin to cry, uncontrolably, and sob.  You can't feel your legs and you, above all, refuse to move towards the enemy.  Adancing is beyond you ability.  As you watch the terror, you see men, big, strong young men, being b lown into the air, legs and arms severed, and blood spraying everywhere.  I remember the horror of a niece who was murdered back in 1987by a rapist murderer and career criminal in Indiana.  Her case can be found on the internet, but I WILL DECLINE IDENTIFYING HER OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.  I CAN DISTINCTLY RECALL, AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY, that I wished this wwas all just a terrible dream, and that after I slept tonight, tomorrow thius wouold all have been just a very nad dream.  I remember, the crushing sadness I felt when I realizxed that this was not going to be the case.  I'e heard people say just that, before and now it was I who was sayingit.  I WAZS true, this is all just a horrible dream.  No, it wasn't, it WAS real.  Terribly real. And, that's how I dfeel when I see this great and epic film, THE greatest War film of all time.  If Steven Spielberg never did another thing in his career, this woulod hae been enough to assure him a place in the movie hall-of-AFSWAME.I SAW THIS MOVIE WITH MY SON At home in the safety of our house and yet it scared the daylightsa out of me.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1YWBPN6CIZU7N	"Obi ""Obi wan liberali"""	"Some of the most moving scenes of this movie are of the aging Private Ryan at a cemetary in Normandy.  Contemplating what others gave to him so that he could live the life he lived, it is easy to put yourself into his shoes and ask ""Do I deserve this?""In this movie, the invasion of Normandy at Omaha Beach is depicted with great amounts of gore, heroism and violence.  Even so, the battle for Omaha was more viscious than depicted in the movie with the German 352nd Division holding out for much of the day, covered by deadly accurate flak 88's (of which a brief mention is made in the movie).  In the movie, Captain Miller is sent with a small company of his surviving soldiers into enemy held territory to locate a paratrooper, Private Ryan, who had just lost all of his brothers in other areas of the conflict.There is interesting drama as this small group manages to get through relatively weak defended areas to the areas occupied by the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.  Managing to miraculously locate Private Ryan, Captain Miller's company joins up with some survivors from the 101st with the goal of not only keeping Private Ryan alive, but holding the town from a counterattack by the 2nd SS and hold the town until relieved.  The ensuing fight is a terrible one as the outmatched Americans are about to be anhilated entirely only to be saved by reinforcements, capturing the bridge and relieving the town.Though there are some historical problems with the movie (that unoccupied territory between the Omaha beachhead and the airborne troops I found implausible), I found the drama compelling. This movie isn't about men bigger than life (ala John Wayne), but regular men giving their all for their country and fellow soldiers.  Even so, the most moving scenes to me are in the cemetary as Private Ryan contemplates the gift he received and the cost of that gift.  It certainly made me stop and think about the gifts of freedom I have and enjoy and how many lives and dreams have been lost in my behalf.Despite the gore, violence and historical inaccuracies, I still strongly recommend this movie."	5.0	Very moving and relevant	2005-07-12	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A27ZCU9LK0CMQ5	"Obiturized ""Metal fan"""	I've wanted this movie on blu ray since I got my player, which was recently, so I've just begun the experience with blu ray, and I just got this version last night, and watched last night, and was blown away at the quality of this release, I'm not going to speak about the movie itself, fans of this movie already know how great it is, my focus is on the product, and this is just a beautiful transfer, the DVD looked really good, but this is a huge step up in my eyes, and while I do agree with other reviewers stating that this is a movie that should look raw like the DVD, but man, this just looks so good, it still has that grainy touch to it as Spielberg intended, which I agree with, but even with that, the picture is just outstanding, right off on D-Day, Omaha Beach, just look at the boats coming onto the beach, and the bunkers and all, it just looks amazing, and the bullets flying through the air, the uniforms, the weapons, you can just see every little detail, and once Miller and his crew set out to get James Ryan, the grass, the weeds, the land just jumps right out at you, so bright and vivid that it feels like you're out there with them, which is what a film should do to you, bring you to the moment, and this one does.And the audio, like, wow, it is just in your face, D-Day will sound like a bomb just went off near your house, I'm not kidding either, I mean the DVD had a great audio track, but this one here will just rock you, the machine guns, the bombs coming in and hitting, the water, the cantenes, the actors voices, the sounds in the backround, the score, I just can't say enough about how good it sounds, you will hear things that you didn't on the DVD, but it's not overdone, what I mean is, there is no point where the audio goes over the top, it's right where it needs to be.Now the extra features, there is no new ones, what you get is basically all the extras that have been on the former DVD versions, I have the 60th Anniversary Commemorative edition, and it did NOT have 'Shooting War' which is a nice lengthy documentary hosted by Tom Hanks himself, it clocks in at 1 hour and 30 minutes, so that was a nice surprise for me, since I had not seen that, I think that was on a different DVD version, now the features are not in HD, except for the two trailers which is kind of disappointing, but I can deal with that, with how great they've done on this transfer, they made up for the lack of new extras and not transfering them to HD, so minor complaint for me.Now I've read that early releases of this particular edition did have its problems with being out of sync about 2 hours into the movie, it has been fixed, according to former reviewers here, the way to tell is to look at the UPC code on the back, if it's yellow, then you should be good, mine is yellow, and I watched it all the way through last night, and I had no problems with it, so I'm glad, so if you buy this at a local store, look for the color of the UPC on the back, if it is yellow, than chances are you got the right one, I'm sure all the bad ones have been pulled by now, but to be safe, check, thats what I did before I bought it.Paramount has done a hell of a job with the Sapphire Series, I have 'Gladiator' 'Braveheart' and 'Saving Private Ryan' both Gladiator and this look and sound fantastic with nice extras, I have yet to watch my Braveheart, but when I do, I will be back to review it, I can't wait!	5.0	One of my favorite blu rays!	2012-11-27	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z	Octavius	This WWII film is definitely one of Spielberg's crowning achievement as a director and film producer.  Although a rather  stereotypical story and arrangement of characters, the technical brilliance involved in the combat scenes more than makes up for the defects.Personally, I just don't see the logic in the mission to save Private Ryan because he's the last surviving son of a family: what about those families who lost their only surviving sons? Was their loss not as great?  As for the technical aspects of the film, there are some minor flaws that don't add up such as the drowning soldiers being penetrated by German 8mm bullets when they're over 6' below water: physically impossible as those bullets would lose all momentum at that point!  Some details of the Tiger I tank shown in the film were also incorrect.  Other aspects in the screenplay were rather shallow such as where the 'evil' German Wermacht soldier is freed only to come back and kill the Jewish G.I. Please, this is a stereotypical theme that has been so overdone by Spielberg that it's quite frankly getting old and makes the characters appear as what they are: crude stereotypes.  Regardless as to his sensitivities on this subject, such generic categorization is beneath his talents.  I think Roman Polanski, who is also Jewish, handles the subtleties of WWII much better in his film 'The Pianist'(a really true story and outstanding film!) demonstrating that there were also many Jewish individuals who were as vile and deceitful to their own as the collaborators and demented fascists who joyfully carried out the political agendas of murderous sociopaths. He demonstrated that there were also many Germans in the Wermacht who were not ideologists but true officers and gentlemen who had compassion for human suffering no matter who the victims might have been.Don't get me wrong, this is truly one of the best WWII films ever made in terms of accuracy and special effects.  The story however was rather weak in my opinion and tasted more like your typical Hollywood syrrup.  I find Spielberg's production of 'Band of Brothers' to be far superior to this film in terms of story line with action and effects that are just as realistic and authentic.	5.0	A Tour De Force	2005-05-02	11	6	5

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A24HBJFXTF8ZGV	Old Salt	I wanted this movie in my personal collection - after seeing it twice in the theaters several years ago.  I'm not a great movie buff, but this was special.  I'm also a military history buff, and have studied Normandy and D-Day extensively.My father is a WWII Vet/Infantry Officer.  He didn't land at Normandy, but was in two amphibious landings in Europe - Anzio Italy and Southern France.  He never talked about them much - even after he presented me with my commission many years ago.  After reading eyewitness accounts and seeing the opening scenes, I can understand why he didn't want to talk.I think the other appeal of this movie is the way Speilberg crafts the interpersonal relationships among the men - especially the newby interpreter Allman who at heart is a coward and demonstrates it at the end of the movie by shooting the prisoner as compensation for his own inability to do his duty earlier, when it mattered.	4.0	Fitting Memorial for the Finest Generation	2007-01-09	5	2	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2VK365XEVCYC8	One More Option	"It is the 4th of July as I write this review.  Driving home, alongside the interstate was a firetruck crane erected to hold a giant US flag some 250 feet in the air.  On this day we celebrate independence, I remember Saving Private Ryan.Arguing which is Speilberg's ""best film"" is probably a futile exercise.  Fortunately, sometimes in life you don't have to choose a ""best one"".  There are several of his films that are equally perfect in their different pursuits.On this 7th month and 4th day, I recall 7 ideas from the movie and 4 charges:1)  There were men of honor, duty and mercy on both sides of the war - One of the most memorable scenes is the German showing mercy to the US soldier in shock as he descends the stairs.2)  The acts of war create injuries, both physical and mental, that cannot be healed.3)  Better persons than us died random and unwarranted deaths so that we might enjoy so many freedoms.4)  The violence and injuries of war are far more gruesome than most people choose to concede.5)  The gods of war laugh at the concepts of fairness.6)  There is no solace or remedy for the loss of a child (or children).7)  Men of few words often show their character through their actions.  But they are not silent, and in times of need, they lead by saying well chosen words.4 charges:1)  When viewing war, don't just look at the tactics and movements of armies.  Explore the individual human dramas.2)  Each person must search to find ways to be decent in indecent and insane circumstances.3)  You don't do anything by yourself.  No one succeeds on their own.  Any success you achieve is on the shoulders of soldiers who fought so that you would have the ability to succeed.  ""Angels on our shoulders.""4)  ""EARN this . . .earn it,"" Captain Miller said with a bullet in his chest. What are you doing every day to make the deaths of these soldiers worthwhile?  Did they die so that you would be working at what you are working at today?  What more can you do to make the most of the opportunities they sacrificed for you to have?"	5.0	Saving Captain Miller	2006-07-04	11	7	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A30LMTLC9XVWKJ	Only-A-Child	"War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment.An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is ""Saving Private Ryan"". Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release).Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy (""Paths of Glory"") or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war (""The Enemy Below""). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them (""The Longest Day"").This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only an inner child."	2.0	Inspiring This Nonsense Was Hitler's Last Act of Revenge	2006-11-15	6	4	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2TOZDMQM1XM8I	Owain Wilson	Yet again Steven Spielberg takes a potentially fantastic movie and delivers a supreme disappointment.  Sure, Saving Private Ryan has many unforgettable scenes and images, but so what?  Great bits make not a great  movie.  The gruesome beach invasion that opens the movie is shocking and  spectacular up to a point, but quickly becomes boring.  Come on, any film  that extends a scene comprised entirely of soldiers in combat to 25 minutes  is seriously pushing its luck, no matter how 'worthy' the subject matter.  What follows is one and a half not terribly interesting hours of not  terribly interesting characters debating the merits of their mission and  getting into the occasional scrape.  The final battle is perhaps the most  engrossing part of an otherwise limp movie.  I do wish directors like  Steven Spielberg would resist the temptation to make their 'important'  movies last three hours; there is simply no reason other than ego stroking.  Saving Private Ryan is essentially a terrific two hour movie fighting to  get out of a tiresome three hour running time.  Also, when will Spielberg  return to making his films in the 2.35:1 widescreen process?  His last five  films were shot in the smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio and as a result they  look like nothing more than glorified television programmes.  Unfortunate.	3.0	A mildly entertaining let down	2000-06-03	12	5	7
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2GHTSBU7IHIBO	Owen Hughes	"I watched this movie all the way through, but wondered afterwards that I had been able to do so. What is it with the Americans that they so love scenes of violence? The opening fifteen minutes, over which as much ink has  probably been spilt as blood, were not in the least realistic, to my way of  thinking. Apart from stating the obvious, that you couldn't ever capture  that much detail with a beach-based camera crew during a real battle (and  therefore the attempt to replicate the scenes 1940s style was completely  flawed), it was historically inaccurate. To say that this is what the  landings on D-Day looked like is false. Certainly, on some of the beaches  that fatal morning, U. S. troops (among others) did face extremely accurate  and deadly fire from well placed defensive positions, but that was not the  case at every point in the attack, nor even the rule. Some beachheads were  established with remarkably little loss of life. This was due to either  lack of preparedness on the part of the defenders or by the degree of  surprise the attackers attained, or by the mere fact that, in some cases  and in spite of Rommel's preparations, the landings were made on poorly  held ground. Choosing to focus on a beach landing where the fighting was so  desperate was therefore totally gratuitous and in my opinion, it  demonstrates a degree of sadism on the part of the director to have done  so. He could make a movie about a regiment of Scotch Guards attacking a  Boer position in 1899, and with the firepower of the Mausers then  available, it would have been just as violent and certainly as deadly.  There was nothing so special about D-Day in that sense.In addition, what  the opening scene had to do with the rest of the story is beyond me. As for  the rest, in spite of having thought about the details a good deal, I  cannot see that the story was anything but a vehicle or even an excuse for  a movie about D-Day (which means that what we have is a fifteen-minute,  totally falsified newsreel). Of course there were families who lost four or  more sons in the fighting. The war was made up of a myriad of curious  statistics of that kind.Perhaps the most devastating fault I found with  the film, once it had settled down to a random patrol meandering through  the countryside of Normandy, was that it had absolutely nothing to say. At  the halts along the way, the conversations between the members of the  patrol, although they appear to be trying to say something, are devoid of  content. And as for the series of events which occur, I had a hard time  maintaining any sense of continuity, and therefore felt there was hardly a  story at all (hence the feeling of the newsreel again). This was especially  true of the freeing of the German soldier who would later turn into an  authentic Aryan killer, as implacable as he had formerly been pathetic. Why  focus on this one sideshow of the war? Is it to show the awful Nazi for the  treacherous scoundrel that people may imagine him to be? Is it to show how  humane the Americans are by comparison? As for this character's subsequent  ""execution"" by the one member of the patrol who had to overcome his own  apparent cowardice to carry it out (and who did so by shooting an unarmed  man - bravo), well, by that time, I was feeling I must really have missed  something important. When poor old Tom Hanks was slowly expiring in the  middle of the bridge, I must admit I was almost relieved. I thought, ""Thank  goodness that's over."" So many meaningless details left me utterly bemused  as to why the film had been made in the first place. I confess I'm still  wondering."	1.0	The violence of war becomes the artistic prop of a sadist	2000-05-26	56	20	36

It is always the  same with Spielberg: he says he wants to give youa message, but the only  thing he's after is your money !  Where's the message against War in this  movie? Showing thousands of tons of blood will only make children play  soldier more frequently !  (no harm here, just a fact) It's incredible how  such gifted actors as Hanks and Sizemore accept to play dumb characters  with no depth at all, only for the pleasure of the &quot;experience&quot;  to work along Spielberg, who is the ultimate Master of Marketing, nothing  more than that (exception - &quot;SCHINDLER'S LIST&quot; - even in this one  at certain mments he tried to be the false sentimentalist again).	1.0	TARANTINO could have made it !	2000-05-03	31	9	22

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1CLBDDIZCBIW8	Patrick Murzyn	The ragtag group behind enemy lines has been done before.  And while the character types are stereotypical, the viewer gets involved in them nonetheless - perhaps BECAUSE of the familiarity with the character types.  The first 30 minutes grabs you by the ruck straps and, from that point on,  you're along for the ride.  If anything, the interludes between action  sequences allows you to catch your breath, beyond going a long way towards  letting the viewer really get to know the characters.  Thank goodness for  DVD chapter stops, though, that let me skip over the sappy, manipulative  opening and closing present day scenes.  I get more of a sense of duty and  sacrifice by watching the opening and closing battle sequences than I do  from seeing a weepy old man salute the flag.As a DVD, this is reference  quality.  Picture clarity is superb, with the opening landing craft scene  always giving me a sense that I'm there with the crew.  Surround mix is  active, and your subwoofer will be gasping by the time this movie is  over.I wouldn't nominate this film as evidence of absolutely perfect  movie-making (I'd actually put Speilberg's Schindler's List way above this  film), but there's no doubt it's an engrossing 2.5 hours, and you could do  a lot worse when picking a DVD to show off your system.  Highly recommended  as a film and a DVD.	5.0	Kind of sappy, but gripping nonetheless	1999-11-29	7	6	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AP9GGY8GAA1LT	Paul Amestoy	"Let me start of with this, This movie is proibably my favorite and among the best war films ever made. I decided to write a review because many people were saying ""this is not factual"" and things of that nature so I just had to rebut. I'll get to that later though.Anyway, the movie itself is great but in my opinion the bonus disc is pretty weak. It is interesting to see how the movie was made but I think they should have also thrown in a d-day documentary or two and things of that nature. It is, after all the 60th anniversay commemorative. In my opinion, there should be some d-day material there.And now on to the long part, the bone I have to pick with other reviewers. If you are satisfied by what you have read you can stop now.First, many people say the plot is cliched and unoriginal. Okay, many of the messages are cliched, i agree. However, all war movies have the same basic idea that this does. SPR does go into deeper issues, though. Throughout the movie we see the soldiers questioning their orders and acting more human than the ""yes, sir"" ""no, sir"" patriots we see in other films. We see something that is representative of the war in general. It covers D-Day and many of the events in the movie are representative of the Normandy campaign in general. Overall, I think this movie shows the soldiers in a different light than many movies do; it especially shows that they are citizen soldiers, regular men who are fighting a war. Now I also went through many reviews and found what people say is historically inaccurate and found that they really have no idea what they are saying. I quoted these reviews and made my own rebuttals.A common thing I saw was that people think the idea of sending a squad to save one man wouldn't have happened and they are right. However, the point  beyond that is that the movie is representative of the war and the soldiers, it doesn't necessarily show an event. I will say that if you want complete historical accuracy see Band of Brothers, it is made in much the same way but it is entirely nonfiction.""The battle on the beach lasted 9 hours, not 20 minutes. You don't quite get a feeling for that one.""- This is true, however, individual units were assigned individual objectives. This means that it is entirely plausible that Miller's company fulfilled their individual objective and, after all, this company is the focus of the film.""While watching the stupid Krauts being mowed down by the dozen you keep asking yourself how they managed to conquer all of Europe in the first place.""- By this time in the war the German army was severely depleted and had to resort to many reserves and conscripts. Not only that, but the soldiers that were left were battle-weary so while that may not be an excuse, it could account for some things."" As a Captain, Tom Hanks' character would be a company commander, responsible for at least two platoons and far too busy to be assigned to such a capricious task with only five other men.""- While the premise of a small unit flatheading through German lines to find a man is pretty farfetched, captains would be assigned to special duties that might entail commanding a 6-man squad on a special mission. Plus, near the beginning of the film, Miller is in command of a company.""Regarding the German prisoner they released that many claim to have returned at the end. The solider released after the combat at the radar site was regular army - Deutsche Wehrmacht. Those solders fighting in the town at the end are SS. While lay people may not know the difference, there is a major difference. Some say he was ""pressed into service"" by the SS. Even if that were so, they certainly wouldn't have issued him a new uniform in the day or two that elapsed between his release and the town battle. One does not have the luxury of getting a fresh change of clothes in the middle of an ongoing battle. These were two different men.""- Yes they were two different men, comparing the pictures of the German soldier who is freed and the man who stabs Mellish (which is what I'm assuming this is referring to), they are different. Plus, when the freed soldier recognizes Upham at the end he is wearing a Wehrmacht uniform, not an SS uniform.""The biggest flaw here is that they try to take the beach without any air or sea cover. Any one who is well versed in war would tell you that if you try to take a beach without cover, you will suffer heavy casualities. No army would commit such a tactical error.""+ There was a preliminary air and sea bombardment of the beaches. Unfortunately, especially at Omaha, most of the bombardment went off-target and didn't do as much damage on the German positions as on other beaches. It is completely realistic that there is no air and sea cover during the battle, and the Americans overran the beach without it.""am tired of this one sided movies that portray the glories. The Germans lost a lot due to their own follies and things like the offensive against Russia, Barbarossa, cost them heavily due to the bitter cold. No one mentions this in the movies. Even when the German High Command asked Hitler to retreat, he would refuse to do so. That was his mistake. He had an uncanny way of sizing up his enemies and only in the end he overreached himself. I am glad that he lost, but it is due to a combination of circumstances. There were more Indians in British army who lost lives than Canadians or Australians. This is never mentioned in any movie. India lost close to 100000 people in WWII, but thanks to their color, they are not considered important. They served in British armies all over North Africa and Europe. They fought some of the fiercest battlest against Rommel.""- This is all true but how it relates to the storyline in this film is beyond me.""Unfortunately the WW II story of the average soldier is lost in the quote We gotta save a kid! end quote heart-warmer.""- I beg to differ. The movie portrays Miller as less of an officer and more of a peer to the men which was often the case. Also, it shows the soldiers questioning their orders and talking and joking with each other. It shows soldiers in the war on a very personal level.""Given the mission is find Pvt. Ryan why attack the machine gun nest? How did Tom Hanks know only 3-4 Germans were there and not 30? Why didn't TH just send his sniper to pick them off instead of doing a frontal assualt? Why was the medic charging the MG when he could have stayed behind?""- I do agree with this, that is a pretty baffling thing. This scene is definitely Hollywood.""Tom Hanks walks around with stripes on his helmet (so snipers can easily tip him off- makes sense)...""- Most officers didn't put the stripes on their helmets for the reason of snipers and, if they did, they would put them on in black so they were more subdued. Keep in mind, though, that this is MOST officers, helmet markings were not uncommon.""The casualty rate for the period (by far the worst that day at Omaha) was approx 11 1/2 percent, far fewer than one one asume from watching Pvt Ryan.""- Yes, the worst casualties were at Omaha and, surprise! The opening scene takes place on Omaha. 11  percent is for the entire allied force. The casualties on the other beaches were much more minimal.""the Krauts are abandoning their bunker and, suddenly there is a Czech speech, which I recognized instantly and startlingly..., the supposedly Czech-speaking Wehrmacht soldier screams out, in Czech language : ""I did not kill anybody, don't shoot me."" The impact on me was immediate - the use of a language other than German (incomprehensible to US viewers, of course) is still the cheap Spielberg device to unnecesarilly magnify (and falsify) the Nazi brotherhood of nations going against ""us"".""- Yes the soldier is, in fact, Czech. Many people from across occupied Europe (including Czechoslovakia) either joined the German army or were conscripted into service. Further, it cannot be said that these soldiers are Nazis. The Wehrmacht was the army of Germany and most of the soldiers were fighting for their country; most of them were not Nazis.Now, like any movie, the film does have historical inaccuracies but I really don't think I'll go into them now.Thank you for tolerating my long review and letting me get that off my chest. To sum up this is a splendid movie but the bonus material is pretty average, that is the only thing I don't like. The movie itself is easily 5 stars."	4.0	Great Movie, Not enough bonus material	2006-09-12	11	6	5

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AWFPO0SDMD4QR	Paul	**This review covers the 5.1 surround version, NOT the DTS version**I was anxious to receive this DVD, since I heard amazing things about its sound quality.  The DVD comes in an attractive case, with well-made graphic design on both the package and the disc itself.  A small pamphlet comes inside the package, with an interesting read about Spielberg and the film.  Not too impressive, but a good read overall.  I popped the DVD into my player and was very impressed with the simple, yet beautiful menu design.  Navigation is easy and the menu design couldn't be more simple, without lacking attractive graphical design.  In the menu, you have the choice of picking certain scenes with a very impressive moving scene index, and you can choose to have English subtitles.  The special features are put together very well.  You have a special message from Steven Spielberg, a behind the scenes featurette titled &quot;Into The Beach&quot;, the theatrical and re-release trailers, cast &amp; crew info and production notes. (Into The Beach is NOT on the DTS version because of space limitations.  DTS audio takes up much more disc space then other audio formats.  If you prefer DTS audio and don't mind the lack of the &quot;Into The Beach&quot; featurette, then make sure you order the DTS version.)  The audio choices you have are 5.1 digital surround and 2.0 Dolby surround.  Whatever type of system you have, be prepared for an audio experience that will overwhelm the senses.  Saving Private Ryan is an incredible film, a real tribute to those that put their lives on the line over 50 years ago.  Spielberg has created a film with top notch production values.  The cinematography and sound design, as well as the production design are incredible.  The picture quality of this DVD is superb.  It is very clean with beautiful detail and a look and style that is amazing, especially during the battle scenes.  The cinematographer Janusz Kamisnki, who I had the pleasure of working with once, did an exceptional job of bringing the viewer right into the extreme chaos of war, and creating a visual experience unlike any previous war movie ever seen.  The sound of this DVD is another story in itself.  The sound design of this film is just about flawless.  Incredibly realistic, unbelievably clean with beautifully recorded music and crisp, clear dialogue.  If you have a surround system, the war sequences will be nothing less then spectacular.  Even those with 2 speaker set-ups, the sound is amazing.  On 5.1 systems, gunshots and bullets will surround your head with such clarity, you may find yourself ducking for cover.  Sound design is ground-breaking, and the people responsible for it on this film should be applauded.  Deep bass is well used throughout the battle scenes, so your subwoofer will have an extreme workout.  The ambiance and atmospheric qualities of the entire film, along with the surround and effects elements, will give the viewer an unbelievable listening experience.  Add this to an incredibly visual film, and you have the stage set for about 3 hours of DVD pleasure.  I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of Spielberg, or to anyone who really wants to hear audio that is simply groundbreaking.  In conclusion, Saving Private Ryan is an excellent, well produced film.  A real tribute to those who risked their lives in World War II.  This DVD is excellent....buy it and enjoy it...an amazing treat for the eyes and ears.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan-Hold onto your subwoofer!	2000-11-05	10	9	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A8IZXBE7J6RNJ	P. B. Pereira	(warning: may contain spoiler) The most noteworthy contribution of this film to the genre of the war film is it's realism in depicting scenery and battle scenes.  It sure as heck isn't the story, which examines the  question of wheter one life is worth risking several.The film doesn't  really answer this question, nor, I think, is it supposed to.  My problem  with the story is that it just seems a bit contrived.And I'm not sure  about the framing device.  The older  Ryan character bookends the film, but  this is comes off as somewhat awkward because if the sequences related in  the film are meant as flashback, Ryan is not the best character to use for  this technique, since he wasn't there for half the film.  Initially, it  keeps people guessing as to the identity of the old man in the film's  beginning but that only works once.The movie succeeds at conveying the  horror of war, but I could've done without the constant platitudes and  swelling violins (not one of John Williams' better scores).  On the big  screen, paralyzed by the gruesome spectacle of massive carnage and anxious  about when the next bout would explode on the screen, I paid little  attention to these matters.  But when I saw it again on cable, the impact  was mostly lost and the films's sentimental elements came rushing to the  fore and proved to be a major distraction.  I was actually considering  buying the film until seeing it on TV changed my mind.  I still think the  film highly noteworthy but I can no longer see it as truly great.	4.0	Striking verisimilitude but not sure about the message	1999-12-02	6	3	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AL8IWEXRY1EWB	"P. Connors ""Colonialpara"""	Coming from someone with a profound liberal political bias, one would never expect to see such a laudatory tribute to the men who defeated Nazi Germany during WW II.  But here it is nonetheless, probably the best war movie (and most visually stunning anti-war movie) ever made.This is Spielberg's tribute to the GIs who took on the mighty Wehrmacht and defeated it.  These were the schoolteachers, the inner city kids, the farm boys and the timid souls who met the &quot;supermen&quot; of Hitler's Aryan Army and defeated them.Why is this the finest war and anti-war ever made?  Well, look at it.  It is probably the closest one will ever see to the real thing.  Arms and legs fly, men die horribly, painfully and screaming.  There is no nobility in war and no glory, either.  Spielberg, with the assistance of an outstanding cast, shows us  that all too vividly.The reason for the mission of these eight US Army Rangers, is the rescue of one lone paratrooper, assigned to the 101st ABN Division, which had been dropped behind German lines on the night of 5 &amp; 6 June as the remainder of the Allied Armada prepared to board landing craft to storm the beach of Hitler's &quot;Festung Europa.&quot;  PVT James F. Ryan is the sole surviving son of a family of 4 from the heartland of America.  Raised on a farm with his brothers, all joined at the beginning of the war or as they came of age.  When his three older brothers are killed in action within a week of each other,  a wary Army staff is prompted to attempt a rescue of the last son from this Iowa family.In a memorable scene which is supposed to include General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army in Washington, several officers argue for and against the attempted rescue of a single private behind enemy lines in Normandy.  No one knows if he is alive and some argue that the rescue mission will most certainly kill most, if not all of the rescuers.  The argument is a sound one, but it also shows the compassionate side of the huge and mostly unwieldy war machine of the United States of the time.  The message is clear; despite the fact that the United States had more than 10 million men and women in uniform in 1944, the force was not that large that it could not look for, find and save one anonymous private, and all because he was the last living male member of his family.The rescuers are a polyglot crew.  In size, their little team is nothing more than a short squad of riflemen.  But they represent the best of the assault troops the Army has available, the Rangers who seized Pointe du Hoc and held it for the rest of the Americans storming ashore.  They are led by Captain John Miller, someone we get to know as the movie progresses.  He is older than the rest and later, we find that he was much older than the average company commander of the day. He is accompanied by the sturdy, career Sergeant, who has see service with him in every major battle in the European Theater of Operations.  There is the smart-assed PVT Reiben, a stereotypical New Yorker who always has a smart remark and a complaint for whoever will listen.  The lone Jew is also present.  He is portrayed as alternately frightened and heroic.  I was saddened when I saw what happened to him in the most personal battle scene in the movie.There is a scripture quoting sniper. Obviously, this was Spielberg's swipe at Southerners and their rifles.  A fundamentalist sniper?  How original and how cliched.  Barry Pepper still did an outstanding job in the role and had I been in that situation on D-Day +1, I would have wanted someone like him along.Captain John Miller also takes along a young linguist, T-5 (Corporal) Upham.  A rear echelon soldier, untrained for infantry combat, he is fluent in French and German.  Later in the movie, he quotes Emerson to Captain Miller and during this interchange, we come to realize that there is much, much more to the heroic officer than meets the eye.  As the movie progresses, we watch in horror as Cpl Upham comes unglued by the rigors and horrors of war up close and personal.  In the scenes where Upham fails as a soldier and fails his fellow GIs, Spielberg allows the young actor, Jeremy Davies to realize an outstanding performance.  It is just one of many in this incredible movie, but it is the most memorable.Tom Hanks was nominated for another Academy Award for his role as Captain Miller.  It was an understated role, delivered with mastery and precision.  I actually believed I was listening to this man and thought he would have made a fine infantry officer; as good as any I served with.  Unfortunately, Hanks, a two-time Oscar winner was not the recipient of a third award.  Like Spencer Tracy, who was also nominated more than twice (and won twice), the Oscar went elsewhere.Everything is accurate about this movie.  The uniforms, the coloring, the insignia, the weaponry, the locales.  As I watched the movie and all the carnage it portrayed, I developed a new respect for my father's generation.  After all, these were the men who were there and brought home the victory.  These were the men of &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot;  If Steven Spielberg never makes another movie, then this one will be his tribute to his father and my father and all of the other men who fought, died and won WW II.  These are the men who made the world relatively safe for the rest of us.Yes, this is a bloody and thought provoking movie.  It is also a masterful tribute to a generation of men the likes of which America doesn't seem to be capable of producing any more. Now, we have greedy yuppies and Generation Xers who know everything about everything there is to know.  From 1941-1945, we had everyday Americans who went out from their homes and defeated the best of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.  They didn't ask for the war, but when the time came, they stood up and met the challenge before them.  This is their movie and Steven Spielberg has done an eloquent job of telling their story.After seeing this movie, I have developed a much deeper respect for my father and men like him.  I have personally thanked every WW II veteran I have met since seeing this movie (as I have with every Viet Nam vet I have met).To those who would take what freedoms we still possess for granted, I can only say one thing:  Go watch SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.	5.0	Visually Stunning, Shocking, Tearful and Harrowing	2000-11-16	6	3	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2ODBHT4URXVXQ	"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader"""	Some people advise others to close their eyes during the loooong opening scene of Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. That would be a mistake. Yes, it's carnage, it's horrible, it's relentless, it's bloody, it's random death, it's a portrayal of fear and courage and raw coincidence. But it's also one of the most powerful pieces of cinematography ever filmed.There are many other scenes that have stayed with me during the years since I last saw this unforgettable film, perhaps Spielberg's best ever. Perhaps the most poignant one that comes immediately to mind is the woman whose sons are all away at war. She's on a remote farm, washing dishes, and thru her window she sees the dust of approaching cars. She goes outside to meet the visitors, tenses as she sees military brass and a chaplain step from the cars, then crumples wordlessly to the worn boards of her front porch as she tries to take in the news: all her boys have been killed, except for one: Private Ryan.Another related scene, the one that came just before this one, is equally gut-wrenching (and in both scenes, there is no dialogue, just heart-stabbing visuals that are more powerful than any words could have been) as a woman charged with sending out letters of the We Regret to Inform You variety realizes that she's seen three letters with the same address within the past few days, and she takes this terrible proof to her supervisor - and thus is born the search for the surviving son, to bring him home to his momma.Tom Hanks, with his own persona of morality and honesty, is perfectly cast as the good Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier charged with this onerous task, and of course there is terrible cost.Saving Private Ryan is the film Spielberg HAD to make. Outstanding, in every possible way.	5.0	Unforgettable. The best war film ever made.	2004-04-02	271	234	37
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3E9C95QHGYKWH	Persuivant	A great war film - for about 20 minutes, and maybe the last 20, where the filming is done as if the camera were your eyes and you were one of the soldiers. When the soldiers are taking cover the action is filmed from a  low position, when the soldiers are running, you run after them, looking  around the battlefield as you try to get to cover before the flashes from  the German pillboxes put a bullet in you! Somehow though the film sags a  little in between... Once the landing scene is over, its kind of like the  film is over. I wasn't expecting a bullet a minute all the way through,  even though I think the reality of D-Day would have been a better  ready-made story, as the story of the Titanic was. I couldn't help feeling  that the idea of saving a soldier from a war seemed improbable, and didn't  really keep the film going very well - not for me anyway. The film has  obviously  been made with care and attention to detail, but I think most  people who watch it will only remember it for the first part. Definately  one for those interested in or studying the events of WWII however, simply  for its highly-realistic &quot;first-person&quot;  tell-it-like-it-really-was perspective of history, although it should be  remembered that not only the US took part in D-Day! :-)	4.0	Great beginning, but a better story was in the background.	1999-12-14	4	2	2

That should be enough for all of us to make a promise to ourselves to personally thank as many vets as we can for serving to keep us free. War is no walk in the park, and this movie comes closest to capturing just how close to hell it really is. This movie teaches a lot about sacrifice, courage, heroism, and emotion. Sometimes there are causes greater than our own selves which are worth sacrificing for. A great movie for this era.

The confusion, brutality, and noise of war are brilliantly realised by the director and cinematographer.It's not perfect, however. The central premise is a bit too cute and the framing device of a veteran visiting a war cemetary is overly sentimental, especially right at the very end.Spielberg's commentary on WWII is not the ""masterpiece"" that many purport it to be, but it is still a fine film."	4.0	"Stunning depiction of men under fire but not the ""masterpiece"" many purport it to be"	2007-10-27	6	5	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2000DWMMYNIYB	Peter Lorenzi	"Words of praise for ""Private Ryan"" have been written. I agree with (just about) all of them. Just one note of caution: There are two very powerful, graphic acts in this film: the D-Day landing that occurs about ten minutes into the opening and the defense of the bridge that basically concludes the film. Some of this is very graphic in its realism. And this is not a documentary nor even a portrayal of a historic rescue. But let me add how parts of this excellent work can be used in a (college, business school) classroom.Leadership: Miller's (Hanks) initiative and direction at the D-Day landing shows the the use and importance of flexible, determined action to reach the goal.Much later, a second example, when Miller describes his approach to rationalizing or explaining how he can tolerate the death of the men serving under him. He can because he must and he sees each death as the price of winning the war war. A good class discussion could ensue.Creativity: When Miller illustrates the use of the ""sticky bomb"" and deploys his small force, we get a lesson in creative use of available resources in a tough situation.Mission: As the small team walks through the fields of Normandy, Miller leads his men through an impromptu session on grousing and mission. What IS their mission? Who decides?Inspiration: When General Marshall gets the news of the Ryan brother deaths, he reads Abraham Lincoln's letter to the mother who suffered from a similar fate. Marshall reads it to his staff as a method to motivate and inspire them to ""save Private Ryan"" and he is so moved by the letter, he sets it aside and recites the closing paragraph from memory.I am always moved by Miller's dying words: ""Earn this!"" When years later Ryan, at Miller's grave in Normandy, asks his wife if he has lived a good life, she understandably can't understand. Watch this film and perhaps you can  learn a few lessons and, hopefully, understand."	5.0	Lessons for life and for the classroom	2002-06-30	3	1	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A14JAMNDZXP6QN	Peter T. Winters	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is certainly the most real WWII movie ever written and directed. Although I've never seen real war it had a very deep impact on me. Almost from the first scenes of the movie one starts to realise what  war really means. There's nothing beautiful about it and even the most  heroic deeds are just another massacre.I don't take it as a novel but  rather as a collection of short stories connected with the search for Ryan  who's three brothers have died in different battles at the same time. We  follow a squad of stonehard soldiers who are sent to find him and send back  home where his mother waits. They are showed as a group of coldblooded men  who can't be stopped in their search. They play games with the metal  ID-plates taken from dead US soldiers in front of a group of greenhorns who  haven't seen actual battle yet, they kill their enemies mercilessly and  with great skill, etc. But at the same time they have their own sad stories  to be told around the lantern late at night, they try to rescue civilians  and sometimes they even don't shoot the imprisone nazis who have just  killed their comrades.Hanks is brilliant as the leader and no bad words  can be said about the rest of the cast either. Of course the backbone of  the movie are the horrifying battle-scenes were nothing is shown in softer  light than it actually is. And without the brilliant camerawork the movie  wouldn't be what it is. Those viewers who aren't who hate patriotism should  not let themselves be disturbed by the opening and ending, cause this is an  obligatory part in an American warmovie. Finally, SPR really deserved the  oscars given to it; it WAS the best movie of 1998."	5.0	Watch out for blood outside the silverscreen!	2000-06-01	3	2	1

Spielberg did such an amazing job that it left me and my father in tears. The charater he  created for the old Private Ryan looks, acts and even limps like a 75 year  old veteran like my dad. And while the landing scenes were memorable to  most viewers, the other battle scenes were very powerful and accurate. This  movie is not only good, it is valuable to our veterans.

Watching this film is a genuinely life-changing experience for anyone. The graphic, and extremely necessary, depictions of World War 2, the amazing cinemetography by the amazing Janusz Kaminski, the extraordinary direction by the always dependable Steven Spielberg, and the unbeatable performances by the stellar, first-rate cast, led by, in my eyes, the best actor of his or possibly any generation, Tom Hanks. This film is astoundind from every aspect. Of course, when it came out on DVD, I was the first to buy it, and tokk it home and sat in awe as I watched the film almost repeatedly all day, analyzing it's endless, and I do mean infinite, complexities. From the extremely pulse-pounding and gut-wrenching opening on the beaches of Normandy during the infamous D-Day invasion on June 6th, 1944, to the climactic end battle scene, this film stays thrilling every moment. I could easily say that this is the best war film ever made, which it is with no doubt, but for some reason, that just isn't enough. Being an absolute movie maniac, I have seen any move you can ever name. But this film, no question, has the best film making, acting, entertainment, and connection with the viewer that I have ever seen.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3V61K0EF38GP4	Philip Scholz	"There are countless of reasons that legendary director Steven Spielberg should be celebrated for.  In this film, the most applicable (for me at least) is his attention to detail.  Specifically, his attention to detail for the time period in question.  When three young men die during the 1944 Normandy Invasion, the military resolves to send the fourth surviving brother home to his mother.  However, this Private First Class James Francis Ryan is missing in action, so a squad is assembled to find him.  Led by Army Captain John H. Miller, played by Tom Hanks, they set out through war-torn France on this ""public relations"" mission.  This film is awesome as is and Steven Spielberg paid attention to every detail to make it right.  The fights, ranging from one-on-one brawls to full-blown battles, were all epic.  The characters were interesting and their dialogue was worth listening to from beginning to end.  I sometimes wonder how the military managed to keep a sense of organization over a war this massive, but they obviously managed and this film shows us only a piece of what they had to contend with.  It may have only been a piece, that it was one heck of a piece.  This film gets my full recommendation...no hesitation.  Enjoy."	5.0	Another Fine Spielberg Production...	2014-06-21	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A104QTD4GDT2OQ	Philip S. Walker	"Nice effects, shame about the storyline ... which could more or less be said for all Stephen Spielberg's movies. In this the boy who never grew up gives us another boy who never grew up, Tom Hanks, postulating he is a US Army Captain with a fondness for leading his men into suicidal missions, including direct attacks on bunkered machine-gun positions. Ordering them to attack tanks without dedicated anti-amour weapons is another murderous past time of his, and in the final scene he loses nearly all his men defending a bridge that should clearly have been just blown up. To make matters worse he has little control over his crew, who often openly disobey his orders and gladly murder German soldiers when they surrender with their hands in the air (if we are still hunting down old Nazis and taking them to court, perhaps someone ought to find the ex. US soldiers who seemingly committed these war crimes, as also shown in the ""Band Of Brothers"" TV series). Of course a film could be made about such a complete idiot, who probably existed in abundance, but the incredible thing here is that we as viewers are supposed to take a liking to this extremely incompetent and irresponsible officer. With Dale A. Dye as adviser we are ensured some rough battle scenes, but it all looks a lot more like Vietnam than WW2, and the fighting is often so fierce that in real life no one could have survived it (a problem Spielberg solves in the climax scene by letting the same soldiers die several times over). On top of that we get the usual symptoms of someone without a clue making a war movie, such as soldiers hiding from enemy bullets behind plank fences, not covering themselves properly behind walls, shouting at each other on patrols, preferring sentimental discussions over preparing their positions etc. etc., and of course the film gives the usual impression that WW2 was won mainly by foot soldiers, who threw themselves at enemy positions with no regard for their own lives, as if artillery, airforce, navy etc. had practically no influence on the outcome.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ANJ5YJNHN5E7E	Phil Montgomery	I rate this movie as one of my all time favorites just below the first two GODFATHER films.  The film itself sends a message that sometimes war is necessary, no matter how horrible.  The film shows the sacrifice made by  Young Americans who fought for the freedom of &quot;strangers&quot; half a  world away.  The acting is top notch, with &quot;Oscar Worthy&quot;  performance by almost the entire cast and with particularity another Great  performance by Tom Hanks.  The DVD itself is the best you will own for  both sound and picture.  I own both the Dolby Digital and DTS editions, you  can't go wrong with either but there is a difference.  If you own a  surround set up with DTS Decoding, then buy the DTS version.  While the  Dolby Digital is better than any other DVD I own, the DTS still blows it  away.  The Dolby Digital has a muted sound to it and the sounds sometimes  tend to bounce around between the surrounds and right/left fronts.  The DTS  version, however, creates a total 360 surround expierience.  The bass is  where the DTS version really pays off, at the end of Chapter 9, when bombs  are exploding as the soldiers leave the church, you can feel the boms  explode it in your seat; while the Dolby Digital version sounds muted.  Once again, the DTS version shines, as the Panzer tanks enter the town at  the end of Chapter 15 and the beginning of Chapter 16.  In the Dolby  Digital version, the tanks sound almost far off in the distance, while in  the DTS version the tanks seem closer and you can almost FEEL the soldier's  fear as they approach.  In conclusion if you have the right set up, get  the DTS version the audio gets 5 out of 5 stars. The audio of the Dolby  Digital gets 4.8 out of 5 stars.  You really can't go wron with either  edition.	5.0	Simply one of the best you will own	2000-04-01	3	1	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A34URM0QDO6GQ1	PianoNut	The troops were shipped to the shore by the british navy but in the film they are americans, spielberg again trying to somehow rewrite history, the war was won by america, nothing to do with the russians or english, right?  In the only mention of the british involvement we get a wig wearing Sam  from Cheers telling us how overrated Monty is. The scene where the captain  is spouting abraham lincoln comes across as crass and artificial, thousands  of soldiers have just died and the entire chief of staff takes a break to  discuss the death of one soldier. Then we get a dewy eyed glimpse of  farmland america complete with white picket fences and billowing corn  fields. A pity as lot of this film is truly inspiring: the start and end  battles, the death of the medic, the german soldiers pleas for mercy. Best  war film?

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2FUOXFJ74B32M	"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity"""	"I remember seeing this film in the theater when it first came out in 1998. I was stunned by how realistic it was, and up to that point I had never seen anything like it. The cinematography makes you feel like you are there, in Normandy, with the troops. 'Saving Private Ryan' raised the stakes enormously in regards to war films. In my opinion, it immediately became the benchmark that future war films would be compared to. To this day, I tend to subconsciously compare any new war film I watch to this masterpiece. Much to the dismay of some of the reviewers here, SPR is actually....gasp....patriotic! It actually has the nerve to portray American soldiers as honorable and the war as a just cause. This is not to say that they are portrayed as saints or fearless heroes. This is no John Wayne movie. The characters are men with flaws and weaknesses just like everyone else, and this gives the film a very realistic feel. Sure, the plot is fictitious and it's a little over-sentimental, but as far as I'm concerned, 'Saving Private Ryan' remains THE classic war film that stands above the rest.The negative reviewers just don't get it. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not a documentary nor does it claim to be. It is a tribute to the American soldiers who fought and died in WW2, period. If you want to see the British or the French, there are plenty of other films and documentaries out there to accomodate you. If you want to see an ""anti-war"" film, or some profound, intellectual insight into the human condition, look elsewhere. If you're a bitter, cynical, nit-picker, you probably won't like 'Saving Private Ryan.' But if you want to see a patriotic, yet realistic film about World War 2, look no further."	5.0	Still the best	2006-10-21	11	7	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1WRIS4RJLSA7A	"Planetary Eulogy ""Senior Fellow, Hessian Stud..."	"Great film is an illuminating thing: it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity, revealing the greed, hatred, and hypocrisy that fester there. Bad film is often just as revealing: its existence and reception serve as a mirror reflecting the hearts of its intended audience. Saving Private Ryan is a classic example of the latter, in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow, the American people stand revealed for what they really are: stupid, self-absorbed, morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hear.""Saving Private Ryan"" is typical Steven Spielberg fare: a big budget spectacle, bereft of style, filled to the brim with childishly heavy-handed moralizing and peopled with facile ""characters"" who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play. Even the film's underlying subtext is an old Spielberg standby - America GOOOOOD, Nazis BAAAAD.The plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question: is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many? This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the D-Day landings, and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention, ham-fisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology. Spielberg being Spielberg, there's never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered (hint: with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone - because, obviously, the same scene wasn't manipulative enough when it was used to close Schindler's List).The film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as US soldiers assault Omaha Beach. This opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism, but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory, full of irritating, disorienting jump cuts, pornographically Gibsonesque attention to gory detail, camera tricks and special effects artifices, all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive US vs. Them POV. When I saw this film in the theaters, the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed, then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood: this, I'm sure, was Spielberg's intent.Having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war, Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie. It has been discovered by the War Department that one Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war. Unfortunately, Ryan was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the Normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines. In a moment of supreme hokum (complete with a quotation of a letter by Abraham Lincoln that wouldn't feel out of place in a Ken Burns documentary), Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall (Harve Presnell) decides that an effort will just have to be made to save Private Ryan.At this point, Saving Private Ryan becomes just another motley-crew-of-experts flick. A team of caricatures is assembled: the tough-as-nails seargent; the feisty Italian; the pious Southern sniper with Talent on Loan from God (if the historical setting had been Vietnam, I'm sure this character would have been replaced by Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Magic Negro); the REMF wuss - all led by Tom Hanks in the role of Tom Hanks, Captain Everyman. Call them the Sanitized Seven. Battles ensue. Some of the caricatures die (does anyone really remember which ones?). The Germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how EVIL they are. One wehrmacht man - having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the REMF - returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an American to death. Oh those tricksy Krauts! In the end, Ryan is saved and Tom Hanks is dying. But it was all worth it. Cue the graveside maundering. USA! USA! USA!The problem with Saving Private Ryan is the problem with everything Spielberg touches. More broadly, it is the problem of the American commercial cinema. Lacking the courage of any real conviction, it cannot offer any challenge to its audience. Instead, it panders to that audience with easy answers, impressive effects, a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American. What's missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesn't break down neatly into heroes and villains, cowards and the courageous, us and them. In the place of subtlety, it gives us spectacle, in the place of art, it delivers technically proficient propaganda.This is your comment, you may delete or edit it."	1.0	Simplistic Schlock for the Simple Minded	2006-10-19	133	55	78
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The opening scene of Stephen Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan which depicts the Allied Forces D-Day invasion of Normandy Beach is more graphic, harrowing, stunning, intense, spectacular, realistic and amazing war scene ever film.  We feel as if we are plopped right in the middle of the action.  We hear the ping of bullets on metal, the deafening noises, the blood, the gore, and the stink of death and destruction.  Through the eyes and ears of Tom Hanks' Capt. John Miller, we get a sense of the struggle and will to survive under such unthinkable conditions.  The movie's ending, while not as good as the opening scene is still stunning and brilliant.  Those two scenes are among the finest Mr. Spielberg has ever filmed.  The problem with the film is that between those two bookends, the middle part of the movie drags on.  After D-Day, Capt. Miller's troop is sent on a mission to find a Private Ryan who three brothers have been killed in battle.  He is the last male member of his family and if he is killed, his family name will die with him.  Capt. Miller and his men are of course ticked off that they have to risk their lives for this faceless grunt.  We follow the troop through the French countryside and the obvious confrontations come up.  Mr. Hanks always adds class to anything he does and his subtle and heroic portrayal of Miller saves the middle section from sinking completely into cliche territory. Edward Burns appears in his first movie that he didn't direct and is serviceable as an angry solider, Tom Sizemore is good as Sgt. Horvath and Adam Goldberg deserves mention for his part.  Despite the boring middle section, the DVD brings all the majesty and glory of the opening war scenes top an almost theater like quality and it is still a very good film.	4.0	Visually Stunning	2001-02-01	5	3	2

Instead of troops aggressively seeking the enemy, this platoon is lead by a teacher (in his real life) who goes behind enemy lines to rescue a boy from a family that has already lost its other boys.  When they find Private Ryan, he wants to stay and fight, but they make progress towards getting him back in one piece.  Along the way they see civilians who've been bombed out, shelled out, starved, and lacking medical care.  Not a happy story, but a realistic depiction of wartime trauma.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AMQAG6BGFCIJS	Popescu Lucian	"If Spielberg would work in Stalin's vicinity he would surely have been life-appointed as Chief State Director. His movies are superb totalitarian craftsmanship that goes far beyond its Soviet founders. I think propagandistic themes have never been so smoothly explored before Spielberg. For example, let's watch some footage with German troopers: they are... and what's most important not personalized at all. Personalization is one sure way toward deviationism, because it would give the no matter how unlikely possibility of watchers to sympathize. The German in Spielberg movies he's unlike any German you now, as Jews in Nazi portrayals. They are objective enemies, whose crime is possibility of offence not offence itself. These people are faceless, simple masses to be disposed of because they don't fit in with present ideology. Depersonalization (the Fritz in this case, Capitalist or Bourgeois to Communists, Jew to Nazis) is of course one of most immediate demands in completing this task. On the other hand, the ""good"" Allies are faceless, soulless and linear as well. They have no particular feelings, except some violent outbursts and commercial memory of their idyllic lives at home (probably one of his compromises to make money from). In fact, both enemy and ally could easily be interchanged with no loss at all. As Stalin said: ""You might never know where the next deviationist will appear from!""... The keenness of avoiding ideological deviations is something quite rare if not masterful compared to the large segment of propaganda movie productions today on the market. Another unusual quality struck me: the art of making people feel they actually reasoned during watching just through the simple technique of putting the questions whose (mostly incorrect) answers are already known by heart through state sponsored indoctrination."	2.0	Bravo, my sweet Soviet friend	2002-01-13	24	7	17

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2VN986E5KR1NV	ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen)	"Simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made.  Not only is it one of the best artistically, but it is one of the best in terms of worthy subject matter and honorable values.  It is impossible to view without being deeply touched by the gritty courage and priceless sacrifices made by our troops.The film, directed flawlessly by Steven Spielberg, is a gut-wrenching, white-knuckle, heart-pounding epic that powerfully portrays war in its awfulness.  Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast of characters who get completely absorbed in their roles.  As Captain John Miller, Hanks plays a quiet, decent school teacher who is also a lion-hearted, selfless patriot who overcomes his fears and weaknesses to lead his men on a virtual suicide mission to find and save one soldier who could be located almost anywhere within a vast, hostile region.The film is unrelentingly violent and realistic; though there are a few, brief poignant scenes of reflective conversation among the soldiers in-between the many bloody battles. Hanks should have been nominated and awarded by the Academy for his utterly convincing portrayal of Captain Miller. Also riveting are performances by Tom Sizemore as the rugged and resourceful Sargeant Mike Horvath and Giovanni Ribisi as Medic Irwin Wade. Perhaps the most memorable portrayal in the film is Jeremy Davis' searing role as Corporal Upham, a deeply terrorized and conflicted translator.There are also many interesting cameos, including Paul Giamatti, Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, and Ryan Hurst (""Gerry Bertier"" from REMEMBER THE TITANS).  All of the acting in this film is so good, one never thinks, ""Wow, that's good acting.""  It just feels very real.The cinematography and sound are stupendous and the sensitive score by John Williams accents, rather than overwhelms.  Of all of Spielberg's films, this one isn't the most awarded or the most lucrative.  But it's the best and most significant (at least, it's tied with SCHINDLER'S LIST for that honor).I wish everyone in the world could see this movie.  It is illuminating on so many different levels.  Above all, it reminds us that we exist today because of the courageous sacrifices made by others on our behalf.

Tom Hanks and the supporting cast are brilliant, and the way that the movie is pieced together gives it an unparalleled flow and depth.  Anyone who wishes to detract from this movie's value has to have some seriously flawed logic in doing so.  Not one thing about this movie is stupid, trivial, or uninteresting.  The battle scenes have few worthy comparisons, the dialogue is substantial and meaningful, the settings are perfect, and the impact should not be lost on anyone.  Spielberg may never again duplicate the mastery of this movie, but even if he did not, this movie would be good enough on its own to immortalize him without the assistance of &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;E.T.&quot;, or &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&quot;There are good movies, there are great movies, but only a few are the best.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	I saw this movie when it first came out to the theaters.  I had been fore-warned about some &quot;unsettling&quot; scenes at the beginning of the movie.  Indeed, there is a graphic depiction of the horrors of war that should leave all viewers ill at ease (to say the least).  Many people may object to these scenes.  I came to the conclusion that Spielberg intended to give his audience a glimpse of the horror and chaos of war.  I believe that he did so, not so much to shock us, but to give us a greater appreciation of what our veterans endured in times of war (and that, in turn, IS shocking).  If this movie had accomnplished nothing else, it deserves our appreciation for that one aspect.  I think that we at home appreciate the risk and the sacrifices that our men and women in the military services accept.  We just never got such a lesson in what they went through before.  Imagine having to keep your wits about you when all that carnage is happening all around you to people you know and care about.  I think that this movie will be shown regularly on Memorial Day and Veterans Day as well it should.That issue aside, there is a lot more to this movie and, again, it all points towards honoring the commitment of our men in uniform.  The very beginning of the movie sets us up for the idea that we are seeing this movie from the perspective of a veteran.  The story evolves that a group of soldiers are asigned a special task during the D-Day invasion aftermath.  The assignment itself seems impossible and there are times that a number of the men want to quit.  This serves as a reminder that soldiers aren't consulted on their missions, they simply go out and do what they are required to do, regardless of how much sense it makes.  Ultimately, the men, and the movie, reach a climatic point and we are reminded again about the horrors of war.  The movie concludes back in the present with a moving scene that shows the depth of the camaraderie of men that served in combat together.This movie boasts many things including outstanding acting and direction.  The special effects, as mentioned, are outstanding.  There is a message about combat that is disturbing but very honest.  We see men doing things that appear very wrong to us sitting in our comfortable seats.  We see men who rise to the task as well as men who fail to meet the task.  This reminds us all that these soldiers are men who were called to battle.  They are like us but we are not like them.  They are in the arena and we are not.  What would we have done, how would we have coped, how would our comrades remember us?  All these questions are thrust at us and it underscores the message of the film; we have always lived amongst heroes who went off to war and quietly came back home.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2ZLC6G2VPFI7V	Randy Labbe	The Movie sends chills down my spine. With the exception of The Band of Brothers DVD collection, nothing can compare to the feel you get from Saving Private Ryan. With a cast full of talented actors on the verge of breaking-out, and led by the man himself (Tom Hanks), you cant help but feel like your in the middle of the action. Barry Pepper was unbelievable in his role as the sniper Jackson, and Giovanni Ribisi was good too. Even Vin Diesal gave a good performance.	5.0	AWESOME	2003-04-26	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A24JOL1ZRO0BNZ	Ravenlore	I submitted a review of this before - But it must have gotten lost.While the opening sequence pulls no punches and is truly a  technical achievement, it should be obvious [director] Steven Spielberg  uses the heartbeat of this story to do his 'Jewish duty' and portray those  nasty Germans as totally vile, even making it clear the German POW's should  be shot. It is testament to Spielberg's manipulative skills that this film  is as popular as it is. It is, after all, supreme propaganda.For a more  honest approach to the horror of war, check out Apocalypse Now.	1.0	Government issue war film	2000-08-11	51	18	33
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A337VQW00OJ5I5	Rawitat Pulam	Having watched more than hundreds of movies, I dare say that, Saving Private Ryan is one of the best among that.No other movie had ever give me such realistic feelings...the feeling of desperation, the feeling of  many things else that I thought one could experince them only in the real  war.Next good thing, the soundtrack by Oscar composer, John William. His  music always made many of the already-great films even better.For my  conclusion, this is the BEST movie ever released from Steven Spielberg!	5.0	One of the &quot;Masterpiece Movies of the Millenium&quot;	1999-12-17	4	2	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3OZ52A626WW4B	Ray	For those who haven't seen it yet, it won't be quite like it was for original moviegoers who had heard only a little about it.  So I'm glad I was among those to see it when it first came out.  That said, it's been  over a year since I've seen it (a few times), and I still find myself  thinking about some of the scenes and holding back the tears.  With the  shaky (literally) camera, the dirt literally flying at you, etc. etc.--the  cinematography is first rate.  The characters are very interesting.  When I  saw the first 20 minutes of the movie the first time, I  was in shock. I  couldn't believe what I was seeing--not only because of the gore, but  knowing THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT WAS, according to verterans (minus the  smells).  Add that to the hopelessness felt by those on the beach (and the  audience), and WOW.  The final battle scene also had me on the edge of my  seat, especially hearing the Tiger tank coming through in surround sound.	5.0	It will stay with you always	1999-10-13	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A36AEX807WBY4Q	Ray Perren	In &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, Spielberg paints a hauntingly painful picture of how precious every life is, and how important it is that we never forget the men and women who died for the &quot;last just war.&quot;  As the World War II generation begins to pass away we are reminded at how  great a sacrifice these men and women made in order for us to enjoy the  freedoms we have today.  Tom Hanks plays a convincing &quot;everyman&quot;  as Captain Miller in that it could have been any of us, just an ordinary  person (an English teacher in this case), trying to do his job to the best  of his ability.  The movie is cut in the mold of &quot;It's A Wonderful  Life&quot;.  And the message is the same from both, life is a precious  gift.  We must never forget the impact that one person, whether a Captain  Miller or a George Bailey, has on the rest of mankind.  Sadly, both  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;  missed out on the Oscar for best picture of their respective years.  Both  films will undoubtedly be viewed as national treasures for generations to  come.	5.0	Every Life Makes A Difference	2000-03-11	3	2	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A29R3O02O0PON4	"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head"""	The VHS Edition was recorded in High Definition, so the picture quality was just awesome even on a 240 Horizontal line-Rez standard VCR. Sound is also excellent on my 3D stereo system--not quite Dolby Surround, but close.As for washed out colors, you may be referring to the high contrast the film was shot in.  That was normal.  Some scenes have a &quot;heavenly&quot; glow in them for  a purpose.  I think they used a high shutter speed also because some  explosions look similar to cam-corders using high shutter speed.I  believe the Widescreen Edition is a must.  It is in 1.85:1 ratio which  isn't much different than full 4x3 (1.33:1) ratio of Pan &amp; Scan.  I  don't understand people who don't like widecreen.  It's the WHOLE picture!

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A63WW5UC6KU18	R. Burney	In a few words, this picture was robbed of its 1998 Oscar for best picture. It is, undoubtedly, a masterpiece of modern film, and deserves all the praise it has received. What I like most about this film is not the gut-wrenching realism, or the way the film transports you back in time, but the way it leaves you feeling at the end. My mind was numb as the fluttering American flag faded out at the end and the credits rolled. Never before had such a harrowing portrayal of war been shown to me. I didn't feel like I had just seen a movie, I felt like I had lived through an experience.Part of what makes the such a great war film is its brutality. The gripping battle scene in the beginning is so real that to this day my adrenaline rushes when I see it. The movie does an excellent job of making you feel a part of the conflict. You are alongside Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men, and you never know who is going to be the next to die. The feeling of anxiety never leaves you as this film goes on. Spielberg never lets your mind wander. Your eyes are glued to the screen, expecting a German to pop out of the bushes or rubble at any moment.What makes this quite possibly the greatest war film of all time is how Spielberg brings you into the mind of the characters in this movie. You see them struggle emotionally, weep, and fight for their lives, and you believe in them, because you know that there were soldiers just like this and in situations just like this in the real war.I recommend everyone see it, because it is a harsh reminder of what price was paid for our freedom, and it shows how the war was really fought. I developed a newfound respect for our veterans as a result.This isn't a movie, it is a snapshot of history, preserved beautifully on film for all to see.	5.0	Quite possibly the best war movie ever	2001-05-30	1	1	0

This movie shows the horrors military service men faced, as well as hinting on the strain of families living among war torn Europe, or waiting for news from a loved one at home in the United States.  My only fear is that younger viewers will watch this and only see a fictional tale.  I fear people will not believe that the service men had to go through what is shown.  From the stories of my Uncles, all veteran's of WWII, I can assure you the emotions, the life and death decisions, the living conditions, and the spirit to perservere to guarentee the freedom of the world was not exagerated in this movie.	5.0	An Important Lesson for Younger Generations	2003-07-07	4	3	1

Facism and genocide.Unfortunatly, genocide  continues, but the great war they won let this world live free. If someone  knows a person who fought in WWII, shake their hand and say thank you. The  veteran may not understand at first, but it is deserved. this movie is a  living tribute to those who fought, and those who died.

I use it as a benchmark to other movies in terms of technical stuff. It also shows what other war movies did not : the whole cruelty of the war, some  scenes are so realistic in depicting battles - that I don't recomment  weak-tempered ones to watch this movie - too much blood and dead bodies all  around. One thing that annoyed me is that this movie shows only americans  and few germans soldiers - it makes you think that war was between germany  and USA only. But that's not true, the film should have shown other parties  like soviets who had lost more than 40 mil people on that war but there is  nothing about them in that movie (although it's an american movie and me as  a former soviet can understand this). Germans were poor shown : they were  most of the time like background noise that is to be terminated - I think  the film shouldn't be so flat in that aspect. Once again this is an  american movie, so if you want to see the war from different eyes I  recommend DAS BOOT, STALINGRAD or any soviet war movie (don't think you can  find them here in USA)	4.0	One of the finest DVD I have ever seen	1999-12-21	4	2	2

My grandpa  even got emotional from it, and he laughed at Thin Red Line (which did  stink, really badly...)! The one quip I have about this film is that it  couldn't be any more unoriginal if it TRIED to be. Yes, the D-Day scene is  graphic and accurate...but that's one of the few remotely unique parts of  the film. Personally, I believe that this movie is mainly just that, a  movie. It's never going to be a masterpiece because it just doesn't lend  itself to it. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket took place in the same war, but  at least they had a different story and meaning to them. There are so many  WWII movies out there (albiet, not as graphic...) and I don't think this is  the greatest one of them.

D-day was the story of thousands who risked everything and sometimes sacrificed all for their fellow servicemen. This Ryan vignette is a sideline for the non-hardcore (who seem to often love the opening sequence, oddly.) See The Longest Day for the overall story.

It is so real it makes you think you are there and you feel what it may have been like to be on that beach in normandy. When the men stormed the beach  and they were getting shot down almost instantly you have this feeling of  why. Why didn't they prepare better, why did they go to that part of the  beach where it was all open with no protection. Like I said it is a movie  that makes you think and wonder about those men that died for our country.  The scenery was excellent and the writing and acting was very exceptional.  I almost felt like I was there. It is a bit long but you really get  involved with the movie you don't realize it. Tom Hanks was not a choice I  would have made for the lead but he did a outstanding job in the role he  played. It goes to say he is a  actor that can play any role weather it be  comedy or drama and do it well. I highly recommend this movie but i suggest  parents not to let younger childern to watch it, it is very graphic in the  details of these men deaths.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3ICHEO78NFE4Y	Rick D. Barszcz	I'm sure i'll get voted down on this one, but i don't understand why todays' directors have to be so graffic and get into such realizm. When your reading a book you need graffic explanaztions so you can picture in your mind what is going on but in a movie where the majority of people are looking for entertainment is another thing.We are living in real war times NOW and have been for sometime.  Maybe alot of Americans are looking for more blood shed, body parts being blown up and scattered all over the place, the cries of people in pain and suffering but  i don't.  What i see in daily normal life is enough.  War films are fine without getting the audience worked up and basically sick from some of the sights in this film.  To me that is not entertainment. If you want war realizm watch the news on TV, read the newspapers, or look outside your  own door or the place you work.  Better yet,,,,just watch all the coverage of 9/11.  I go to movies for one reason, to escape the daily life of realizm, the struggles, the hardships, this screwed up country and i go to be entertained.  The key word here is entertain.  It is for this reason that i give this film only 1 star.	1.0	If i want realizm, i'll go to battle for real	2003-09-13	43	9	34
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A14JN0SRDOUS59	Rick Gagliano	First of all...I really liked it. I am sure you have heard quite a bit about this movie already and I need not reiterate that, but I will share a few thoughts. The battle scenes were extremely realistic and quite  elaborate in detail. While there are many warnings about how graphic this  picture is, it almost seems that there should be no age restriction on the  movie, so that everyone (of all ages) can see the horrid side of war. The  story line is a good one, though not true, it does remind you of the true  story of the Sullivan brothers (five brothers who were killed while serving  on the same navy ship in WWII). I feel the movie could have been a bit more  emotional, or played to the audience's emotions better, instead it was  oriented more toward the details of war, and less to the personalities of  the persons portrayed serving in that war. Bottom line...it was a great  movie and definitely worth seeing.	4.0	First of all..I really liked it.	2000-02-13	2	0	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1GG3J0SNY1BQR	Rick	First, I must admit to a bias: my father was a combat veteran of WW2 and I grew up in non-com military housing. I am also a former high school English teacher like John Miller, the captain of the unit who seeks out Private Ryan. So it shouldn't surprise if I say that this is the finest film of war ever made, bar none. Spielberg and company have created a new, elusive standard for all combat films to follow. I hope it indeed sets a precedent. What makes this film so good? The Amazon.com reviewer has already said much but let me add an anecdote and some parting comments. I saw this in a theatre in Honolulu at a matinee showing. I counted only three others in the theater, one of whom was wearing a VFW beret and sitting in a wheelchair in the aisle near me. Although old he did not look beaten and kept something of his once craggy features. But he wept like a lost babe through scene after scene of this film and, afterward, when I talked to him, he told me that coming to see this film was one of the most difficult things he'd ever done. This, from a man who'd seen frontline action against the Nazis near Bastogne in the winter of 1944. Still, he was immensely glad and relieved to have seen it and said he would bring all his teenage grandchildren when they came to visit him the following week. The last scene of this film will leave you speechless and if you weren't already a patriot, it will have you humming the stars and stripes as you leave the theatre. But this is not a film that glorifies war and therein lies its supremely honest strength. It shows what happens to a small band of men united by a caring captain, superbly played by Hanks, who become heroes even though they remain reluctant warriors. It is fitting and altogether uplifting that their leader is a former schoolteacher. No seeking of paths to glory here; just getting home in one piece. My father once reminded me that a true hero seldom if ever finds the need to talk about his exploits. That is certainly true of Captain John Miller and Private Ryan in this film. This is one to buy, watch with your children or grandchildren, and cherish for years to come. Yes, the first half hour is visceral and shocking, leaving nothing to fancy, but it is ungratuitous violence coupled with soul-searching and even a bit of the sublime. One of my picks for top ten films of the past century.	5.0	Don't Be Reluctant to See These Reluctant Warriors	2001-02-01	4	2	2

This film shows the nasty details of war while at the same time graphicly exhibiting the unwanted necessity of a just war to combat evil. My father was in VietNam and he said this is the most accurate representation of combat he has ever seen. For him this film brought back nightmares he hasn't had in 20 years but, he believes this film shows the honor of the doing the right thing at the right time. In the perverse world of war there is true honor and heroism. Anyone who cannot understand that war is sometimes necessary to defend good against evil is absolutely ignorant of history. Private Ryan displays good vs. evil at it's best. Recommended A++++++++++++++++++++++++	5.0	Ryan does not promote nor condem war	2004-06-08	3	3	0

The most powerful film of the decade. I just hope it managed to convey a real sense of horror, and not just a  sense of patriotism among certain people.It's not the story of heroes  dying for democracy and freedom. It's the story of thousands of young men,  lives that wouldn't have changed a thing, fighting and dying in the most  terrible conflict of all history. Although, perhaps dedicating the film to  all people, no matter what nationality, who died either far from their  homes or in the ruins of towns and cities they once lived in, would have  been a fitting ending.Kudos to Mr. Spielberg.

True, it had some of the most powerful action sequences ever put to film. It's when the combat stops that this film fails.The storyline is absolutely ludicrous.  I can't believe the military would take one of its best commanders and eight other soldiers and send them behind enemy lines on what amounts to a suicide mission because they feel sorry for a little old lady who lost three of her sons.  Especially at such a critical point in the war.  This is pure Hollywood fantasy.  The films depicton of military life and soldiers about to enter battle is similarly unbelievable.  No one ever utters a profanity, and people say heroic things before going into battle.  Spielberg's direction is at times as heavyhanded and maudlin as Frank Capra at his worst.That said, it's certainly not a bad film.  It does portray the brutality of battle as no other film ever has before.  Not quite a classic though.	4.0	One of the more overated films in recent memory.	2001-09-20	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1F1FOR46702YF	R. J Rey	"Director Steven Spielberg continues to make movie magic with the breathtaking war drama ""Saving Private Ryan"". After the historic D-Day invasion, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men embark across enemy lines to find Private James Ryan who's awarded a return trip home after news that his three brothers have been killed in combat. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an astonishing, edge-of-your-seat war spectacle of courage and triumph over incredible odds. Director Steven Spielberg combines amazing visual images and powerful human emotions to create such a moving masterpiece. ""Saving Private Ryan"" includes fine performance by Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore and Tom Hanks in another award-winning role. Its visual effects, thrilling action sequences and realistic backgrounds elevate the film's excitement and sheer intensity. The 1998 war drama opens with a breathtaking recreation of D-Day that could best be described as the most realistic and stunning war sequence in film history. ""Saving Private Ryan"" won five Academy Awards and inspired the award-winning television miniseries ""Band of Brothers"".Spielberg's spectacular war drama gets a decent DVD presentation. The award-winning masterpiece is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains an excellent picture quality with superb color detail and great resolution. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound delivers a powerful home theater experience. Unfortunately, the DVD lacks any worthy extras. It only special features the 25-minute ""Into the Breach"" behind-the-scenes featurette, a short 2-1/2 minute introduction to the film by director Steven Spielberg, two theatrical trailers, production notes and cast and filmmakers' biographies. With its outstanding viewing quality, ""Saving Private Ryan"" earns an ""A-""."	5.0	War Memories	2000-04-14	4	4	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1BK0O8ADRA2L3	"R. Lizama ""Honest Reviewer"""	The more I think about it the more I realize how bad, if not insulting, this movie is. It seems to me like Steven is merely following an unoriginal formula to make big bucks and win academy awards. Look at the facts. He gets a mega-star, Tom Hanks, to play the lead role, then he gets teen-heart-throb Matt Damon to play private Ryan. Then he makes an ultra violent war movie were OF COURSE the audience will feel moved. Other than that this movie has very little else to offer. My dad is a veteran, and I find this movie insulting because it  is obviously  profiting from really horrible events. It made me sick to my stomach. Other than that I must admit this film does do a good job of showing the horror of war,  and by writing this review I abosoIutly mean no disrespect to the troops that served our country in WWII.	1.0	What a convenient formula	2004-10-08	53	19	34
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A32MLGE3YOVWW7	Robbie Lewis	With that incredible opening scene on the Omaha landings, Spielberg brings war to the cinema as it has rarely been done before.  I know some D-Day veterans have said Spielberg got it right, yet others were less sure  suggesting nothing could portray the horror and tragedy of those events in  June 1944.  Whatever the case, those of us who never went will never  understand the experiences of those that did.  But Spielberg shows that  this does not matter so much.In the post-Vietnam world, Spielberg's  first task was to shock us, to rub our jagged nerves, to expose the lie  that there can ever be glory in war.  After seeing Saving Private Ryan no  viewer could be left in any doubt that war really is hell.  There are no  heroes or innocents in this film, only ordinary people confronted with the  dilemmas war throws forward.  Some have suggested the main characters in  the film are too stereotypical.  But it is not really the characters that  are stereotypical but the motives and emotions they represent.  Each of the  central players are voices that need to convey the contradictions, the  riddles, the questions, the problems of armed conflict - all as old as  humanity itself.  These stresses work their way through all scenes: Captain  Miller's shaky right hand; the little French girl offered up by her father;  paralysis on the steps as a comrade struggles for life above; to kill, free  or take captive the enemy prisoner.  Above all else there is the underlying  theme of which there can be no right answer: to sacrifice many to save one,  to return one child to its mother.Spielberg's second task was to  present these themes in a way that we human beings could understand.  Similar to his Schindler's List, Spielberg uses some of the attributes of  documentary to tell his story and for this, the film's five Academy awards  are well won.  The jerky camera shot, the immensely telling sound and  special visual effects, the snappy editing place us in the action.  We  become just another member of Captain Miller's squad looking for somewhere  to fire, to shelter, to prey, and to breath.With Spielberg shocking and  provoking us, his third task was to haunt us.  The movie's memorable  opening and closing scenes will always linger in our thoughts.  Those  images are so raw they leave our emotions punch drunk, singeing that area  of the brain where reason and moderation reside.  The blisters will take  some time to heal which is how Spielberg might have wanted it to be.  With  a new century upon us, some of us might be tempted to think that war is  straightforward, always winnable, good for the character and national  spirit, much as some of our ancestors thought of war at the beginning of  the 20th century.  Spielberg's genius is that he has left us with a  joltingly fresh reminder of war and it terrors.  Especially for our  leaders, war will always provide more questions than answers, and questions  of the most terrible kind at that.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan: Spielberg's three tasks	2000-05-21	9	8	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AMYOYEAO95VLS	Robby Zagoudis	Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie ever made!  Steven Spielberg has given the veterans of WWII a fine tribute, in his best film.(Yes, Schindler's List was excellent as well, but that movie was very dreary.  SPR offers honor and invokes patroitism.) The movie opens with an amazing reenactment of the historic D-Day invasion.  This long 20-minute sequence is the most violent, graphic, gory, and gutwrenching scene in the history of film, but it is also one of the best filmed sequences ever made.(Janusz Kaminski deserved the Oscar for his breathtaking cinematography.) As the landing crafts reach the beach, we are introduced to Captain John Miller(played brillantly by Tom Hanks), a man who is determined to lead his soldiers into battle, but also goes into a brief state of shock every once in a while.  His hand cannot stop shaking from all this trauma.  After the D-day invasion, Cpt. Miller is given a new mission.  Three of the Ryan brothers were killed in combat, but there is still one brother, Private James Ryan, who is alive.  Miller and his platoon are sent to find him and bring him home.  As they begin their mission, there are soldiers who question the logic of this: Where's the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?, asks Private Richard Reiben(Edward Burns).  During the mission, tragedy strikes and soldiers do bump heads.  But in the end, they find the reason behind all of this.  Spielberg deserved his 2nd Best Director Oscar for this fine movie.  Tom Hanks gives the best performance of his career(besides Philadelphia), showing his humanity in the middle of the tragedy known as war.  Not to leave out the stellar ensemble that brings these soldiers to life(Sizemore, Burns, Pepper, Diesel).  This should have won Best Picture instead of Shakespeare in Love, but that doesn't matter.  What someone will take with them after this movie is a true understanding of the sacrifice that these men made to protect our freedom.  That is what matters the most.	5.0	Spielberg's Best Movie	2006-01-19	3	1	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3JPPR6JT75N0E	"Rob ""Coolerking"""	"I think what impresses most people about SPR is its spectacular budget. It is also technically and somewhat artistically well beyond what most War movies have done before. But it suffers from the ""Spielberg Factor"". That is, the story and characters are developed not from a Veteran's standpoint, but from a novice trying to imagine a Veteran's standpoint. Once the plot gets rolling, I got the uncomfortable feeling the soldiers were behaving like children playing war. They were certainly in adult situations, but their behavior was the way children would behave if they were pretending to be adults. I blame this on Spielberg's directing because probably his only experience with war is playing it as a child in his neighborhood. If I may go further in alienating other viewers, I find Tom Hanks of similar ilk, playing his character as the oldest kid in the war game. If they had been carrying plastic toy guns, I would have found the tone more honest. Don't get me wrong, I'm an active supporter of Veteran's Day, and if this movie increases respect for our Vets, then the good outweighs the bad. If there is anything I commend this movie for, it is that it seems to be a sincere, if awkward, reaching out to our Vets by mainstream Hollywood. But for a really good recent war movie I'll take Windtalkers or Blackhawk Down."	3.0	Powerful viewing the first time, but doesn't have legs	2005-03-04	21	10	11
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1N8Z6O4J4GX6B	"Robert A. Slivatz ""SFALV"""	Saving Private Ryan is a historic epic by Steven Speilberg paying tribute to those who participated in D-Day. With excellent cinemotography and sound editing, it was one of the most realistic portrayals of D-Day to date. A stellar cast led by Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, it's told through the eyes of those on a special misssion to bring a last living son home to his family during history's greatest invasion. I suggest everyone have this movie in their library as few can equal its totality of quality in filming and film making. Winner of several academy awards one cannot walk away from this movie without feeling the admiration of those heroes who participated in D-Day. This feeling is shown through the eyes of one of the soldiers throughout his life, and leaves us all with the same sentiments. Steven Speilberg out did himself on this one, and it's a great tribute to those fighting men who made our freedom possible. A must buy for every entertainment collection.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan a Historic Epic	2009-05-12	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A361LE16VBQDP8	Robert Bezimienny	I found this film ugly, stupid and offensive. There is a terrible suspicion that the much vaunted opening Normandy landing sequence is, ultimately, entertainment - the noise and the gore is horrific, but the audience has not been introduced to a single one of the casualties, and so the 'spectacle' is at some level dehumanised - this applies to the Americans, but doubly so to the Germans, who are the archetypal faceless evil.*Spielberg truly disgusted with his eye for the grotesque, even (I'm dismayed to say) the comical in the midst of this horror: think of the soldier whose helmet is shot, who then inspects it only to be shot again, this time fatally, in the head - this belongs in a cheesy Western, not in a film of serious intent; or the soldier who picks up his severed arm. Why are we being asked to witness this?  We do not know who these soldiers are - they are as expendable as extras in a genre horror film - and this is degrading when one considers the reality that is being depicted.*At the end of this opening sequence are we solely appalled, or have we, through the technical bravura, also been excited, in some shameful sense of the term?  Do we want to see the whole thing over again?  If yes, then what does that say about the film's allegedly 'anti-war' intent?*We are introduced to the central characters after all of this. They are not casualties of an anonymous 'war machine', but instead, more or less, follow a stereotypically heroic trajectory.  As archetypal heroes, they are portrayed as successful killers. The worst in this regard is the sniper, Jackson - in this character there is a repulsive conjuction of religious fervour, with its attendant self-righteousness, and fetishism regarding skill in marksmanship. This soldier's talent for killing is portrayed as unreflectively admirable - there is a despicable relish in his achievements, most notably in the moments prior to his death where he shoots (again faceless) German infantry. If we enjoy, even empathise, with his precision as a marksman, how is this 'anti-war'?  It seems no more 'anti-war' than a typical battle-based video game.*There is, of course, the sentimental core of the film, the actual saving of Private Ryan. Literally, this is undoubtedly unrealistic, so I assume we are expected to take it symbolically, perhaps as saying that the preservation of one individual life or, more likely, a way of life, can justify a larger sacrifice, the sacrifice of many lives.  Perhaps this explains the presence of Ryan's family in the opening and closing graveyard scenes - more than a single life has been saved. If this is the point, thenthere must be a better way to make it.  Making war into a fairy tale is inappropriate. To do so is stupid and manipulative.*In the end we have war as seen through the eyes of the man who brought us E.T. and Jurassic Park. If he were humble, he would recognise the limitations of his gifts, and make movies for children. Instead, he debases serious topics by rendering them childishly. No doubt this is satisfactory for viewers who delight in details concerning the authenticity of the tanks used, and in the quality of the sound effects, but that is to say for viewers who are children playing with toy soldiers.	1.0	War is not entertainment	2001-09-21	59	19	40

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ASE0VKWE76QF4	"Robert Eckmann ""USMC"""	Saving Private Ryan was one of the most neccesary films that has ever been made.  It is the harrowing story of a squad of men led by John H. Miller {Hanks} and captures the very gritty realities of war.  Set during the D-Day invasion into fortress Europe, it captures in the best possible sense the toll that war exacts upon those who are called upon to defend freedom.  Spielberg also made Band of Brothers which is also an amazing story of heroism and sacrifice renowned the world over.  No doubt in my mind that these works that Steven Spielberg has masterfully created will live on through the generations as some of the greatest war epics ever depicted on film.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"According to veterans of D-Day, this is one of very few films which come about as close as possible to portraying what it is like to be there. Director Spielberg and his crew recreate the arrival of Allied forces at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, by using water-level and then ground-level handheld cameras during a 24-minute sequence of especially graphic carnage. Later, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men are given an assignment to locate Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and remove him from harm's way because he is the only remaining of several Ryan brothers. (The others have died in battle serving elsewhere.) Stephen Ambrose discusses this situation in his book D-Day: June 6, 1944. Spielberg's primary purpose is to examine how those entrusted with this assignment react to the dangers which it involves. Their questions are understandable: Why is Ryan so important? How are we going to find him? Is it worth risking all of our lives by trying to save his? As the search proceeds,  Miller does his best to maintain the group's morale. He has his orders and is determined to follow them. It is important to keep in mind that Miller and his men have a special mission which is, in certain respects, is even more perilous because they face the same stiff resistance other Allied forces do but cannot be distracted from reaching their ultimate objective which is to find a human ""needle"" within the invasion ""haystack."" They cannot fall back, re-group, await reinforcements, call in air cover or artillery support, etc.Nominated for eleven Academy Awards, this film received five (for direction, cinematography, editing, sound, and special effects editing) and each was deserved. Much as I admire Shakespeare in Love, I remain convinced that Saving Private Ryan should have received another Oscar as best film. For those of us who were not involved with D-Day and the period which immediately followed it, this film enables us to get a sense of what it was like. Obviously, heroic efforts to ""save"" Ryan provide the primary plot. However, I was (and am) most impressed by how Spielberg enables us to empathize with the legitimate concerns about what that ""salvation"" requires of those ordered to achieve it."	5.0	A Military Epic from a Human Perspective	2003-09-15	4	2	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1FC6VDKRZ2Y2S	Robert R. Josef	SOME SPOILERS POSSIBLE:I went into this film TOTALLY COLD on opening weekend. All I knew was &#34;Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, war movie&#34;, so I figured would be good. What I wasn't expecting was a 25 non-stop recreation of the invasion on D-Day.  An assault on the senses -- the war footage is so incredibly realistic that I was begging for relief.  With the possible exception of &#34;The Thin Red Line&#34; (which has an element of sadism that this film lacks, fortunately), as someone else said, this movie has the most realistic war scenes ever filmed. The viewer is not spared -- the second  most disturbing sequence in the film is an extended sequence of hand-to-hand combat from a unexpected character.If that was it, the film would be dismissible, but the battle scenes frame what gives the watcher a true sense of what it means to be a soldier. The characters are are written and performed very realistically, as well. After seeing the film, I understood much, much better what the veterans went through, the traumas they endured and had to carry with them, their courage, and why so many of them were outraged at the Vietnam War protests (although they might have missed the apples-and-oranges nature of the two wars, but that's not a topic to explore here).I don't now if saying I enjoyed the film would be a good way to explain my reaction, but it is excellent. A masterpiece that totally achieves what Spielberg intended it to. He and Tom Hanks, who plays the Captain of the squad that is assigned to retrieve Private Ryan, really should have won Oscars that year. The movie, I'm sure, loses a lot of impact on the small screen, but if my son ever says he's thinking about the Armed Forces, we'll be watching this together. He'll have a much better idea of what he's getting into..	5.0	If you have a son or daughter thinking about joining the military, they should see this film!	2014-06-09	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A19W8NUHWFMLW2	Rob Garrison	"Being young and full of ambition, I thought Steven Spielberg at the time was the world's best director and was flawless with his directing skills (Of course, I hadn't seen his dumb parody, ""1941"").  But when I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"", I was spellbound.  It was probably the most realistic and emotional war film I've ever seen since his work with ""Schiendler's List"".  I knew, from that point, that this was gonna be the best war film to date.In the opening shot, a man is visiting a gravesite in Normandy, France, Present Day, with his family behind him.  Suddenly, while walking in the middle of the row of tombs, he stumbles onto his knees and starts crying.  This causes somewhat confusion to the audience; however, people relize the pain the man is feeling when they see the many graves of young souls, lost in a war that they didn't start.  The film then jumps to June 6, 1944 (D-Day) at Omaha Beach, Normandy, France.  A small group of American soldiers, very young and scared, ride in the ajacent Higgins Boat across the French channel. 2 of the soldiers even vommits in fear.  Then the boat reaches land, by this time you can already hear gunfire and explosions.  As soon as the Higgins Boat ramp drops in front, all hell breaks loose.  Immediately, 3 or 4 soldiers are massively hit with German bullets, leaving the rest in total chaos.  The storming scene, which lasts about 30 minutes or so, is probably the mosy gruesome portray of the horror of war.  After the invasion is over, the remainding soldiers rendezvous.  One of the invasion's heroes was Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his most acheiving roles since ""Forrest Gump""), a jaded and calm tempered school teacher, merely witness his soldiers dying.  Meanwhile, after the storming of the beach, government officials get word that 3-out-of-4 brothers from Iowa have been killed in 3 separate battles.  The remainding brother, Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), is a paratrooper missing somewhere in Normandy.  The plan is to get James out of there and get him back home to his grief-stricken mother.  Thus, Miller and Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore)are recruited to go into the French country-side and locate Ryan before he gets killed.  Miller leads a rag-tag platoon along with, which include the hotheaded Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), the deadly yet religious sharpshooter Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper), the stereotypical Jewish Private Stan Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the jaded medic Private Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), the oversized Italian-American Private Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and probably the most memorable character, the under trained, yet sweet Cororal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davis) as the company's translator.  However, what started as a harmless search-and-rescue mission, turns into a tedious odyssey which anywhere from German snipers to German 88 cannon squads, starts picking off the men, one-by-one, to a point where the soldiers are ready to throw down their guns and ask ""why???"".  That of course is answered in Hanks' brilliant speech halfway in the film.SPR is definately historical in it's own way.  I was astounded and shocked at the D-Day beach storming sequence of the film.  I tired to picture myself in that kind of situation; forced to fight, scared to death, not a chance of survival insight.  Probably the most heart-wrenching sequence in when a soldier is lying on the beach with his intestants spilling out, screaming ""Mommy! MOMMY!""  Spielberg showed us the true horror of war and why we should avoid it at all costs (Except, I don't really aprove of his ""Pro-War"" statements he's been saying in the press about our situation with Iraq).  This film should be shown in classrooms for historical studies.  It's sheer brilliance"	5.0	Best War Film Ever!!!	2002-10-29	3	1	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2WSI8HOWHFDOT	Rocco Dormarunno	Two things prevent me from giving this otherwise great movie five stars. First is Tom Hanks' unbelievably underplayed, at times bland, performance. Whether this was what Spielberg wanted or how Hanks interpreted the role, his Captain Miller sometimes seemed to just disappear off the screen even while he was giving orders. Second, the framing device of the old man in the cemetery was maudlin and treacly. It was just an obvious attempt at tugging at the old heartstrings. The only thing missing was having Captain Miller's ghost appear and give Senior Citizen Ryan a salute back.And that's that. Otherwise, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stands out as one of the best movies of its genre. People DO have to be reminded that war is hell, that war is bad, that war is the most awful waste of lives. (The film's extraordinary battle sequences will be talked about for years, and have already influenced several directors.) People DO have to remember that the Nazis--and I don't mean all the Germans, just the Nazis, specifically--were brutal. And we DO have to remember the bravery and heroism of the American soldiers who fought in that most violent of conflicts. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN helps us to recall or, for those too young to remember, to learn about these things.	4.0	We Do Need To Remember	2004-01-09	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	"This is a very good movie.  It is essentially the story of one group of soldiers, American Rangers, from the assault on Normandie beach through the early fighting thereafter in France.It opens with the best combat scene ever filmed for a movie.  This is no exaggeration.  The initial combat scene is incredibly realistic, moving, and bloody.  It unbelievably authentic.The acting is very good.  How can you not like Tom Hanks as the Ranger Captain?  He's great.  The supporting cast turns in fine performances as well.  Some stereotypes, but hey, they are well-acted stereotypes.The movie does have a plot, which is more than can be said for many war movies--this one is to locate and return to the States a young man whose two brothers were recently killed in combat.The story line could be more brisk.  It drags in places.  The movie is probably about 20 minutes too long in my estimation.  Hollywood has been going through a ""phase"" where it makes movies too long.  I think Dances With Wolves started this trend.  This movie continues it, although not as severely as ""Dances.""Technical: the video is great (DVD) and the sound is simply the best of any DVD I own (hundreds).  Very high quality.This is a fine movie, worth owning and watching.  While it is not the best war movie ever made, it is a very good one."	4.0	Very good but not great.	2002-11-07	4	1	3
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2BIAR1V0PWO27	"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S..."	This film almost makes it to being a classic, but it fails at times for being overly sentimental. The opening D-Day scene on Omahu Beach is terrific, it leaves you shacking almost! After that the movie becomes an almost routine tour-de-force of all the old GI squad flicks going back over the years. Its alomst like Speilberg watched every old GI WW2 movie ever made and took a piece out of each to mesh into this film. In a way its a tribute to the genre I suppose. The opening and closing scenes with Ryan and his family years later is a tear-jerker for sure. It would have been nice as well had Tom Hanks and co while searching for the elsusive Ryan might have come across some British and Canadians. This would have added greater depth and color to the movie and provided a little dfifferent perspective. Most Americans don't really know much about the British and Commonwealth contribution to the war, and this would have been a chance to show a little of it. Too bad. The equipment and gear is very accurate, the two German Tiger tanks and open topped assault guns get A+ from me! The battle in the town with the US paratroops is also good showing how confusing the opening Normandy battles were. The final battle at the bridge, while exciting, is fantastic. These are German Panzer Grenadiers, the best the Wehrmacht had, yet they seem to be portrayed a bit like key-stone cops! If anything it was often small German platoons holding off large numbers of green US troops in the Normandy bocage. Speilberg got it a bit wrong there, but something like that would not be so romatic for film goers. Final point, the P-51 should be a P-47 that knocks out the Tiger tank on the bridge at the end. Otherwsie, a decent film overall despite these flaws.	4.0	A Near Classic	2003-06-11	5	2	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2GQOI25E6UY25	RolloTomasi	So much praise has been heaped upon &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; I feel compelled to meekly point out that Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, stirring as it is, really isn&#65533;t quite the unqualified masterpiece it&#65533;s made out to be.Let&#65533;s start with the celebrated opening battle scene, which just about everyone immediately points to as the film&#65533;s highlight. On that I&#65533;m in complete agreement--this 25-minute sequence of carnage, an exhaustive recreation of the Normandy invasion, is so enormously convincing that it all but sucks the juice out of the rest of the movie. And yes, though some &#65533;Ryan&#65533; enthusiasts might prefer to think otherwise, there is still a two-hour movie to follow, and rarely is it as gripping or effective as its prologue.Not that &#65533;Ryan&#65533; is a bad film--it&#65533;s a rather good one, actually, shot with handheld cameras that bring a chilling immediacy and palpable texture to the story. Aside from Spielberg&#65533;s excellent direction, all credit is due to the fine cast. Just when you think you&#65533;re going to be sick at the sight of Tom Hanks in yet another &#65533;Oscar-worthy&#65533; role, the man surprises you--he&#65533;s never shown deeper range, subtlety, or quiet intensity than he does as Captain John Miller. Equally impressive is Jeremy Davies as Timothy Upham, a stammering, vulnerable young corporal whose fear we can completely identify with.There are individual moments in &#65533;Ryan&#65533; that are almost staggering in their intensity--and I&#65533;m not just talking about the battle scenes. I&#65533;m talking about an early moment in the film, when the gentle pitter-patter of raindrops on leaves consciously echoes the sound of bullets, and the sound of soldiers&#65533; footsteps. I&#65533;m talking about the slow-motion closeup of Hanks&#65533; face as he arrives on the beach, unable to comprehend the fiery chaos around him--the most penetrating and lyrical image in the entire movie. It&#65533;s moments like these that make you wish the entire film held together more convincingly; its cumulative power, though very real, feels more fragmented than organic, more sporadic than enveloping.Where &#65533;Ryan&#65533; stumbles is where so many grand epic-minded films stumble--the script. This is, of course, a war film, so it&#65533;s not fair to expect a lot of witty repartee. Nevertheless, I wouldn&#65533;t have minded had the dialogue been a bit more memorable, or if it had shown a bit more freedom from the conventions on which it falls so often.  Other flaws kept nagging at me throughout--why did Spielberg feel the need to include those unnecessary present-day bookends?  His film is pointed and emotional enough without having to resort to a device like that.  Why introduce a young private that Miller and his men accidentally &#65533;mistake&#65533; for Ryan, when we in the audience know very well that there&#65533;s more than an hour and a half to go before the big climax?  Why the constant refrain of John Williams&#65533; score during moments when silence would be more effective?  For every masterstroke there seems to be a minor but damaging misstep, and it&#65533;s unnecessary punches like these that remind us that &#65533;Saving Private Ryan&#65533; is still just a movie, and that Spielberg, as fine a storyteller as he is, has not risen entirely above the occasional cheap manipulation.Much has been made about &#65533;Saving Private Ryan&#65533; being &#65533;robbed&#65533; at the Oscars, which is really a load of tomfoolery if you&#65533;ve actually seen the film that beat it for best picture. The Academy was right to name Spielberg the best director, but they were even more right to name &#65533;Shakespeare in Love&#65533; the better movie.  As a tribute to the men who gave up their lives on the battlefield, &#65533;Saving Private Ryan&#65533; is an admirable and important film.  As a cinematic achievement, it must be held to a higher standard.	4.0	A good film, not a great one	2001-07-31	3	3	0

There are some scenes where the video doesn't look right.1. The Omaha beach scene, when they capture the beach, the fires that are burning seem to stretch or glow beyond where they actually are.2. Near the end when Upham finally captures those Germans and shoots the one they let go. That scene to where he is just standing there, there is this white haze that glows and streches all over.Anyone know what these could be from?

You are with the landing force as it hits the beach at Normandy.  Shells are exploding, landing craft are blowing up and machine gun bullets are pinging off of metal.  Craft bow hatches are let down only to let machine gun bullets enter and wipe out the would-be invaders.  Still other soldiers, loaded down with ammo and weapons, jump out into deep water to sink and drown on the spot.Survivors scramble to the beach where they are shot down in the scores.  Eventually, they organize, push through with Bangalor mines and are able to destroy points of German resistance.  Germans who surrender are mown down without mercy.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1HOCDM0Z0RZZZ	Ron Thoma	I am a movie addict.  I've been to so many movies it is bizarre.  I am 50 years old.  I want to say I've seen at theaters and rented thousands of movies in my life.  I think I am pretty accurate in that statement.However, I witnessed in the summer of 1998 something I had never witnessed in ANY movie I have ever seen.I had already seen Saving Private Ryan in my hometown.My father which was on the first wave of Omaha Beach had also seen the movie and he was deeply moved.  He is still alive at 86 years old.  He was captain of the medical corps and actually picked the location where the American troops would be buried in France just off the beach as depicted in the movie.  He had nothing to do with the memorial but he did pick the location.After seeing the movie in my hometown I went on vacation in the summer of 1998 to Colorado.  While staying with some friends in Fort Collins we went one night to see Saving Private Ryan at the local theater.  This is what happened that I have NEVER seen before after watching a movie.When the film ended.......not.....one......single.....person....got up to leave while the credits were rolling!  NOT ONE!The theater was packed!  It was a LARGE theater. Only when the house lights came on did people begin to quietly get up to leave.I have never seen this in any movie I have ever seen in my life.  I have seen many people stay for credits while some leave.  But never the entire packed audience stay put in their seats.  Every SINGLE PERSON stayed in their seats.I don't think I will ever see this occur again in ANY  movie.This should tell you something about Saving Private Ryan.	5.0	Never Seen This Before!	2003-03-01	12	10	2

I've read extensively on the topic of war, and that depiction of the landing at Normandy was probably accurate. But really and truly I ask you, is it really a surprise to anyone that war is dark and  ugly and violent and horrible? Did we really need Spielburg to show us that  on screen? No.Now the rest. Why is this being hailed as a masterpiece?  What was masterful? The blood and the guts? The graphic violence?The  entire plot - the philosophical question of several men dying to save one  man is hardly original. And that question could have been asked and  answered without the graphic depctions of violence.The on screen  violence made my physically ill, to the point where I had to leave the  theatre for a few moments to regain my composure.I bet if you surveyed  some veterans of World War II, (or any war, for that matter) most would be  grateful their families and loved ones did not have to see the awful sights  they'd seen.Why oh why did Speilburg feel compelled to bring this awful  imagery to every man woman and child?&quot;Masterpiece&quot; should be  a name reserved for artwork that uplifts thought and forces us to become  introspective and grow mentally and spiritually.Saving Private Ryan was  no masterpiece.	1.0	I wish *less than* one star was a rating option here...	2000-04-28	49	15	34

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AAGFBE5EM7YKB	Roule Duke	"Speilberg deserves kudos for the stunning and moving Schindler's List, that films is his greatest masterpiece and by far out shines SPR in every criterior.What I won't to know is am I the only one who doesn't think Ryan is the greatest movie ever made? I mean seriously compared to THE DEFINETIVE D-day movie the Longest Day, SPR is stale one-sided soap opera which would rather tell a sappy sentimental fairy tale than explore a real important historic event. Every one raves about the impact of the first 20 minutes of Ryan (which are the only part worth watching) but seriously every time the camera pulled back to a wideshot there was only a handfull of GI's which totally lacks the real sense of scale of the mass invasion, captured in Longest Day's amazing invasion scenes and while SPR is more gritty than Longest Day (only because of cencorship at 1962 the time of LD's production), hey Steven I like my movies gorey and have seen alot more extreme gore in movies.Also the shear one-sided nature of this movie is hard to accept, I mean we see brave American's dying on the beach..........and that's it. Hey that did happen and I resept those people but this is no excuse for Speilberg to portray the landings like this when Allies of other countries died just as brutally on the same day a few miles away. Also the Germans are protrayed as these unseen cold blooded killers when in reality they were ordinary men desperately fighting what they knew would be a losing battle. I'm no Nazi but really in this day and age there is no need to protray Germans in this propaganda film way. In reality (convienently not told in SPR) the Germans got up in the morning to see literally thousands!!! of Allied ships which proceeded to bombard them, once again I hate Nazi's but the fact that they tried to hold their positions and not just turn around and run has got to be acknowledged. By diminishing the courage of the Germans this way Speilberg clearly paints them as 'bad guys' like in some campy Western.What proceeds after these landing scences is a sentimental and simple story. There is no depth to the plot or originality to the characters of Ryan and anyone who says there is must have had their eyes closed in the last 50 years to the 100's of other war flicks which have the 'Brave Comander from ordinary background' 'Ox the strong simpleton' 'Brooklyne the wise cracking NewYorker' and the 'weasle like coward'. Really the whole ""this time the mission is a man....."" or ""why risk our lives...."" are but simple cliched points that have being explored much better in other films and are handled with complete imcompetance by Speilberg who obviously think's this he's directing ET.For a real idea of the D-day landings watch the Longest Day, it is far superior and shows all sides in accurate detail. The only thing Ryan has going for it is the gore, if this was a horror movie critics would say it's disgusting and call for the film to be banned but when attached to a sappy flagwaving war film it becomes the 'Greatest war film ever made'. Hate to tell you but Apocalypse Now, while not realistic, is by far the greatest war film ever made and there are plenty of other films better than Ryan, Fullmetal Jacket, Tora tora tora, Platoon , and even his own Schindler's List.I mean without the gore and Speilberg's name attached to it, SPR has about as much value as Rambo or Missing in Action. Yet maybe thats what people want, a sentimental fairytale with good guys and bad guys, not a true factual examination of war. I mean Black Hawk Down is 100% genuine and has F/X technically superior to Ryan'S but that was no where near as successfull at the box office."	1.0	Am I missing something?	2003-04-01	67	26	41

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A18XCGW9UYFWPR	R.P.	I remember when this movie was released, the media went on about how gory, gritty and realistic the opening Omaha Beach scene was.  I don't know how realistic it was (I've never seen combat), but watching that scene made it hit home with me that war is not a Nintendo game, like many young people might think. After that, the action drags at times, but this remains one of my favorite movies. Great interaction between Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore, and a great performance by Barry Pepper as the pios Southern sniper.	4.0	Probably as realistic as Hollywood will get	2004-04-21	7	5	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1KKENPWKJVAGZ	"R. Swift ""The Old Guy"""	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is well structured; well acted by a superb cast, and is not overburdened with Special Effects as so many oftoday's films seem to be; just enough to tell the story convincingly. The plot line; however, is tenuous at best.  Putting that aside, it is a film that entertains; holds the viewer's interest, and is a tribute to those who gave their lives to end that horror which was so much a part of my childhood.Mr. Spielberg has given us another of his master-works.  Tom Hanks and the supporting cast make it all very believable as a reminder to something that effected the lives of millions, andshould never be forgotten.Best of all it is entertainment at its best; the reason I watchmovies in the first place.

I believe this movie captures the bravery, the terror and suffering; the absolute horror endured by these citizen soldiers in defending their country as close to real as any movie could. Calling them the &#34;Greatest Generation&#34; is no exaggeration. They represented the kind of people our founding fathers envisioned when setting up this great nation.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26Q828JHP0914	R. Wong	Firstly, i'm not in the military. Secondly, I read military books now and  then; mostly non-fiction.  And now, the movie...Some people wonder why  the opening battle is only 20 minutes, considering the actual thing took  hours. Hey, this is a movie; if the opening battle was given full time  there wouldn't be enough time for the other situations.For those who  wonder if the German ( with the knife ) who kills Mellish in the tower is  the one who was allowed to live at the radar site, the answer is NO.  His  face is different; some people say the uniform is different, too.  If that  doesn't satisfy the argument, consider this: if it was the same man, why  isn't there any reaction when he and Upham pass each other on the stairway?  Why wouldn't have Upham shot him then, instead of later on?Speilberg  made the movie to honor Americans who served during the war. People think  he was making the case that America was the country that did the most to  help win it; I don't see that message.  If you want to see how Russian  soldiers are honored...well, there are movies that do that.....don't know  if Amazon.com has any.Is the movie anti-war?  Well.....Speilberg makes  movies about WWII, so he really doesn't cover war as a general concept,  which is what I suppose an anti-war movie would be about. So maybe I don't  have an answer for that one.One reviewer thought the message of the  movie is that America is unprepared for the next war.  That's an odd angle  to look at the movie; I don't see it; if someone asked Spielberg about the  Pentagon's current global strategy or force structure, he might just shake  his head.Capt. Miller's decision making at the radar site has been  questioned many times.  All i'll add is that his mistake may be less as  technical faults of the movie and more like an example of human  decision-making under stress.The battle at the bridge has been  criticized as being unrealistic; I have some agreement.  The German force  had heavy weapons and superior numbers in riflemen, yet couldn't overcome  the defenders without being badly mauled.The cemetary scene with Ryan  asking his wife &quot;did I earn it?&quot; WAS kinda shlocky.So, how do  I give it 4 stars despite the faults? The invasion battle doesn't hold back  on how badly a human body can be mauled; compare this to early 50's war  movies, where soldiers drop when they are hit and have a trickle of blood  from their mouth.  The battle also shows that death doesn't always come by  direct enemy fire ( things that get mentioned in death notices), it can  come from an indirect way ( drowning, an exploding flamethrower strapped to  a friendly soldier ); he didn't go the next step by showing death from  non-combat accidents, but it wasn't really needed here.When the squad  first links up with troops of the 101st, there's an exchange of rifle fire;  a squad member ( Caparzo? ) searches through a group of apples, finally  finding one that's apparently tasty enough to eat; he does this  nonchalantly as if the shooting isn't occuring; in real life, things like  this do go on.After Miller speaks with the hearing-wounded soldier about  Ryan's location, he gets the squad together to check a map. The background  music arrives at just the right time....he checks the map for Romelle,  going from the mood of &quot;we'll never find him, i'm frustrated&quot; to  &quot;we're in business, i'm an officer so i'm going to act like  it&quot;....meanwhile, the 101st continues to move on past.  Symbolically,  this could be &quot;the war marching on&quot;, continuing whether Ryan was  found or not, whether he lived or not, whether the squad lived or died.	4.0	various items	2000-09-09	4	3	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	This movie was one of the top ten films ever made.  Most certainly it was one of the best war movies ever made.  The cinematography (which thankfully won an Oscar) is superb, putting the audience right in the action.  I felt  the bullets go over head, into my comrades in arms, into the water.  I felt  that first horrible step onto the beach (or was it bodies?) and knew this  was the gates of hell.  This did the job of a movie to a T, immersing the  audience  vividly and without mercy.  Some people have said that other war  movies were better and perhaps they were, but in a time of Hollywood cheese  (titanic anyone?)this film was a sigh of relief that at least some people  are interested in more than initial effect.  I saw elderly men, who had  either served in the war or knew people who had, wiping tears from their  faces unashamed and clenching fists at their sides in rememberance of what  Hitler did.  This is a great companion piece to Schindler's List.  Some  other great war movies are Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Paths Of Glory&quot; (my  personal favorite), Full Metal Jacket, Dr. Strangelove ( a Kubrick pattern  emerges, no?) Platoon, and Gettysburg.	5.0	Astounding, Disturbing, Yet Grotesquely Beautiful	1999-09-25	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A11V89GQUU8I3	Ryan McGann	This movie is a very touching, very real story of war. Spielberg made no qualms about the raw violence shown in the movie. It's sickening, it's gruesome and it's real.The cinematography in the film is very well done. The use of hend-held cameras and a special wash used during the processing of the film to flatten out the colors add a special touch, much like Spielberg's use of black and white in Schindler's List. Williams' score is muted and many times non-existent, which underscores the intensity of the action.Hanks gives a great performance, although his character isn't as well developed as I would have liked. Several good performances were given by Jeremy Davies as the interpreter and Giovanni Ribisi as Wade. I especially likd Davies' character: at first he is timid, naive and passive, and by the end of the movie he is corageous, aggressive and violent. Spielberg wanted to show the effects of the war on the men, and it comes out in Davies' character, and to a lesser extent Hanks' character.I saw this movie on opening day, and from start to finish I found it very compelling. But the moment that solidified this film in my mind as a great achievement came when the movie ended. The very large audience was extraordinarily silent, even as the credits rolled by. Nearly the entire audience sat still, until they shuffled out into the corridor. It's a very powerful, emotional, movie that does what every great movie should do: makes you feel.	5.0	A movie every American should see	2003-08-06	4	3	1

But all is concentrated into the daily round of live or die and will the next bullet be for me.I think this is the most moving picture I have ever seen.  It brings home the true horror of war, and especially of the War in Europe.  The men who fought this war didn't brag when they came back, they kept their mouths shut and sealed it in.  And in this movie you begin to understand why they did this and how they could live with themselves afterwards.Just writing this review brings tears to my eyes.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2FA18B50XGXJX	Sam Damon Jr.	If you are reading this review, listen carefully!SPR is a depiction of what happens when a civilian nation mobilizes for war unready and meets a professional Army. Its not &quot;Anti-War&quot; as some reviewers propose,  for its fading flag scene in the beginning is the reminder that for a  nation to be free and not under the Nazi flag, HUMAN BEINGS have to become  Citizen-Soldiers and stop the cunning and the arrogant from over-running  the earth. That this flag is fading is an expression of the humanity of  those who created this freedom aging and dying (the elderly combat veteran  at the graveside) as the new generation is clueless and failing to pick-up  the torch and keep the freedom vibrant and flying. SPR is a subtle  warning---are we up to this? Are we today up to the task of defeating evil  on a world-wide scale like the greatest generation was? THAT'S THE  QUESTION, not &quot;war is hell&quot; and other cliches'. You and I both  know the answer to that question is negative. Just look at some of the  reviews here.To the Anti-American reviewers: the German people of the  1933-1945 time frame put the Nazis in power. I'm sorry, but this was there  time to fight the evil of their day, and they failed. They embraced the  evil, they helped it kill millions. That's what happened and no amount of  anti-American sarcasm and americentricity will change this fact. See to it  that if such a challenge comes before you in the future that you are a good  human being before you are a good facilitator of totalitareanism.  Deal?The point of SPR is that our military has to be ready to fight and  win with superior ground dominance----dropping bombs at 15,000 feet will  not save the day as bombs from 1500 feet didn't save CPT Miller. This  entails a lot of technotactical details which after 3 years of war, vets  like CPT Miller had learned were needed but were stuck fighting the war  with what they had--never an ideal choice . If we don't want to be forced  to having to make &quot;sticky bombs&quot; we had best re-orient this  nation's citizenry to the NEED FOR A COMPETENT, PROFESSIONAL MILITARY THAT  IS BACKED BY THE PEOPLE ORIENTED TO ACTUAL GROUND WARFIGHTING AN NOT  MAKE-BELIEVE POSTURING FROM THE AIR/SEA. If on the other  hand, all you want to do is weep over the loss of Miller and his men, you  are NOT HELPING the real men in uniform today. Like young Private Ryan,  please go make yourself useful in this fight, and &quot;EARN THIS&quot;  freedom we enjoy.Airborne!	5.0	Fact-based depiction of BAD force structure, NOT ANTI-WAR	2000-08-19	10	4	6

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3NPJ2XY3LXUOP	sc_demandred	This movie floored me.  I've seen a fair amount of WW2 movies in my time, some cheesy, some well-executed.  Never have I seen a movie that fully brought home how horrific the experience must have been.  &quot;Saving  Private Ryan&quot; brought home at the very least a fraction of what the  war must have been like for those who fought it.There was indeed a lot  of gore... I wouldn't say it was inappropriate, given the subject matter.  Sanitized war movies leave us with the mistaken impression that war is a  clean, cut-and-dried experience.The film was brilliantly acted as well  as beautifully shot.  Hanks turns in yet another Oscar-level performance,  and his supporting cast did at least as well as he did.  I spent the entire  movie with my jaw on the floor, alternately marveling over the horrors of  war, the realism, and the quality of the film itself.It's not for  everyone... my Dad's a WW2 buff, but I wouldn't reccommend this to him.  I  suggest those of you who cringe easily at TV violence steer clear.  But the  beauty of &quot;...Ryan&quot; is undeniable.  It outlines the twisted paths  we follow in war, the way young men grow old overnight in the trenches and  the way nothing is as it seems when you scrutinize it up close.I give  &quot;...Ryan&quot; five stars, and I also reccommend &quot;Courage Under  Fire&quot; for what feels like an honest depiction of the Gulf war.	5.0	Believe the hype	2000-03-01	4	4	0

Then it was on television last week, and I thought I would see it on the small screen, not as much to deal with emotionally during &quot;that scene.&quot;  Oh, boy! I was THERE, on the beach, with the men, I got so involved it was unbelievable.There isn't a loose moment, a bad second of film or one wrong word of dialogue. I cared deeply about every single guy, I felt everything they did, albeit from the comfort of my home, and I was totally transfixed all the way through and riveted at the end...I was worn out, exhausted from my emotions, and imbued with a new respect and awe at what these young guys went through. I admire Mr. Spielberg, and fail to understand (nor do I want to)the enmity which is flung his way from lesser beings, whose vision is limited by their own hubris and lack of ability or generosity of spirit to acknowledge his greatness in his field.This man knows how to tell a story. He has skills beyond those of other directors and he is unparalleled at directing movies of this scope. He is creating templates of enormous quality for those who come after him, to follow and utilize and thereby learn and create their own visions, with a nod in his direction, and for his direction.I have not been this moved from a movie in many years, and I thank Mr. Spielberg for his window into a world that was previously unavilable to me. Afterwards, I was speechless, literally, and called my friend the next day and tried, with little success to convey how deeply affected I was from this incredible film.A cinematic masterpiece and one that will affect many more generations yet to come. My brother saw this at a matinee in his relatively small town in Colorado, and a group of teenage girls was playing hooky from school to see Matt Damon: After the opening scene, one of them approached my brother and weakly inquired: &quot;Mister, is this real? Is this a true story?&quot;That is the legacy; to tell the stories of young men, not much older than these girls, who were THERE and went through this for our country.	5.0	Truly gives new meaning to the term &quot;Experience&quot;	2001-12-06	1	1	0

When the film first came out I didn't want to see it because of the rumors of blood and guts.  And to a greater or lesser degree that is true.Saving Private Ryan is about finding Private Ryan and getting him home, because his other brothers have all been killed.  In an unusual humanitarian move, the Army brass decided to pluck Ryan from the European theater and bring him home.When found, he does not want to go home.  At least not yet.We get to know Tom Hanks' character -- a former schoolteacher, now in command of a team of soldiers charged with finding Ryan.  The homage to these men was obvious.  These guys all worked together, slept together and killed together.  Somehow they hang on to some sanity as their friends die one after the other.Special Scenes:The change from looking at war intellectually for the man in the Translations Unit to the actual horrors of war.  It was quite a testament to not just thinking about war as a nebulous thing and actually being there and even having a gun in your hand and being face to face with the enemy.  Amazing acting.The opening scenes of D-Day and the storming of Omaha Beach.  Many of the men were mowed down by machine gun fire before the gate even went down while they were in their invasion boats.The death, running blood in the water and the great odds against them was horrific to behold.Bottom Line:The pivotal point of the war was D-Day.  As Spielberg says in the features section, if we did not win then we would have lost the war and the Holocaust would have continued and so on.  The movie, the historical context that is pushed, and clearly an anti-war film, it yet makes the point to pay homage to these men who gave their lives.Freedom doesn't come free.  Highly recommended.Cast & Crew:Directed bySteven SpielbergWriting creditsRobert RodatTom Hanks ...  Capt. John H. MillerTom Sizemore ...  Sgt. Mike HorvathEdward Burns ...  Pvt.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A25SN71LFE1W3S	Scott	This movie was superb.  By far one of the best I have ever seen.  This  movie gives you a true understanding of WWII and the begining scene at the  Normandy landing.  It makes you fell like you're their and the Graphic  Detail is just astounding.  This movie shows that Americans never give up.  And this movie makes you have pride in America and those brave men who  sacrificed their lives not only for their Country but Mankind as  well.Well, enough with the details of the movie let's get to the plot.  The story is about a soldier named &quot;Private Ryan&quot; who just lost 3  of his brothers in WWII.  So the Army sends a small squad of soldiers to  find him.  Along the way they encounter many obstacles like Nazi's and  Tanks and the ending Bridge scene is Awesome.  If you are looking for a  good movie and don't mind a little gore get this movie.By the way, If  you are a WWII fan like me you will love this	5.0	uplifting	2000-05-26	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A37VDL2AVU7708	Scottish Infantryman	"Let me start by saying; I BOUGHT a 300 dollar blu-ray player for this (not really, but by the end of the movie, it felt like it). This movie is as close as you can get to a perfect war movie. It follows Captain Miller with his stuggle to find Pte. James Ryan who's brothers have all been killed, and since all of the men in the family have died, the family name ""Ryan"" must not fade away, so him and his squad are sent to rescue him. The first scene, the D-Day scene was as real as the actual thing to me. And if I'm not proving my point enough, I watched this with my grandfather, who is a Juno Beach veteran (not to mention my brother who served 2 years in Iraq). He litterally had to LEAVE the room because it gave him ""vivid"" memories of landing on the beach under heavy German gunfire. In other words, this is REALLY accurate, so accurate, it made a veteran who lived through the real thing cry and leave the room. So, Miller and his squad drudge through Normandy hedgerow when they come across a platoon of paratroopers of the 101st Airborne, the division Ryan is in. They think they've found him, but no. The emotion in that one scene to me is phenominal. In the end, I don't care how hardened you are, how careless or thoughtless, least-centimental you may be, the last words Miller says as he's dying there in the ruined street, ""Earn this, earn it."" You are guarenteed to cry."	5.0	Outstanding on every level.	2011-01-03	2	2	0

The battle scenes are excellent and very realistically done, they are intense and graphic, just like the real thing.  The story is truly honorable, and dramatic.

It  just makes you want to scream out &quot;SPIELBERG, YOU ARE A GENIUS!&quot;  I would recommend this movie to people over 14 years of age, who likes  Spielberg films, and who likes to watch war films.

On  their quest to get private Ryan home, these soldiers discover the horrors  of war and something about themselves. This movie will make you laugh and  cry, but most of all it will make you think.

But during the 20 minutes of the Omaha Beach landing scenes, all the tears welled up into my eyes.  And because I didn't wanna let her see me cry, I fought so hard to keep the tears from dropping and rolling down my cheeks.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A4BJHXZLZB9WG	Shanghaied	I saw this movie during its theatrical release in 1998, and have adamantly refused to see it again.  I suppose that probably sounds negative, but any slight against this film is unintentional.  After completing this movie, Spielberg and Hanks could comfortably state to the world that their best work was probably behind them.I have never seen a movie that was so powerful that I shook throughout the entire viewing.  By the end, I was not crying, but tears were forcibly running from my eyes from the disbelief and the shock.  I could barely walk out of the theater as the credits rolled.It is the film equivalent of staring clearly into the pit of hell and, for a moment, feeling its unrelenting heat without succumbing to it.  You could learn something deeply insightful from such an experience, but it is not pleasant and not an event you'd wish to repeat often.  Afterward you likely feel grateful if you were spared from its subject.  I cannot imagine how you would feel if you weren't.And that's really all I have to say.  This can never be among my favorite movies, but my respect for it is unrivaled.  It is a horrible masterpiece, not because of its quality, but because of its refusal to compromise its subject.	5.0	A Masterpiece that I never want to see again	2009-09-02	5	3	2

The brutal battle scenes are extremely bloody and realistic, almost painful to watch.  Tom Hanks plays a Captain, John Miller, who is assigned to save a Private James Ryan, from Iowa.  He takes the pick of the little from his squad and sets out to find Private Ryan, along the way we watch the men form 'bonds of brotherhood' with one another, and we also watch two of the most beloved men die...This movie is truly incrddible.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan	2002-06-08	2	1	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3PIJJ4J2DDI6Q	"Shawn M. Warswick ""High School History Teacher"""	"What else can I say about Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's masterpiece about the D-Day invasion of Normandy?  This film represents the pinnacle not only of war movies, but of film making in my opinion.  The characters are memorable, the cinematography is amazing, the direction is right on, and the actor's all deliver with performances that are nothing short of perfect.First let's talk about the cinematography.  It's wonderful.  The shots are all reminiscent of Life Magazine and the original images of the invasion.  This, however, is just where it begins.  Spielberg, ever the perfectionist, and his cinematographer (Janusz Kaminski) use a first person perspective of shaky camera's to put the viewer right in the middle of the battle.  Whether it's on the beach, or pinned down in the middle of a french village, the viewer certainly feels as if he is there with those soldiers.The script itself was a wonderful story.  The idea that you would risk a few to bring out one man because he is the last of four children is powerful.  ....  The sacrifice these men made for one was selfless and honorable.  The writers certainly captured the spirit of what is being called ""The Greatest Generation.""As for the actors, well, they were amazing.  Tom Hanks is certainly the best actor of this time period and he proves it with this performance.  Tom Sizemore is excellent as the competent and battle hardened sergeant.  Barry Pepper delievers the performance of a lifetime as the religious sniper and Giovanni Ribisi's performance as a soulfull medic makes me wonder why he accepts such [bad] parts in movies like Mod Squad (to name just one of his many horrible movie choices).In short, this movie was robbed when it lost out to Shakespeare in Love and is one of the greatest movies ever made.

I am just your average Joe movie watcher.  But I can tell you if I like a film or not and why.  A lot of folks feel that this may be the one of the best WWII films ever.  I agree that it may be the one of the best to date in the technical sense, using up-to-date, groundbreaking film and audio techniques to really entrench you in the battle scenes.  And I agree that the first war scene on Omaha Beach on D-Day was extremely effective and emotional, capturing the utter frustration, fear and horror of the men involved.  And I think the casting was great and the acting was well done.  But for some reason it did not give me the payoff that I was expecting.  I had a difficult time becoming emotionally attached to the characters.  When Tom Hanks (Miller) died at the end I didn't even feel bad - I knew it was just a movie.  It did keep my attention the entire time and I did &quot;enjoy&quot; it if it is okay to say that.  But the best ever?  I'm not so sure.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2IK776FY6MEMG	Skipjacks	This is quite simply one of the best movies ever made. Period.I'm talking top 5 of all time level of great. In fact, to this day, I still think the Oscars are a joke because they chose the dorky RomCom Shakespear in Love as the best picture over Saving Private Ryan. That still sticks in my crawl 16 years later.It's a great story. It's extremely well made. The acting is superb. The music is wonderful. There is nothing bad about this film. Nothing.It shows you the horrors of war as well as the greatness of humanity all in the same story.I decided to rewatch this movie this year on June 6th (the 70th anniversay of D Day) after watching a lot of interviews of WWII veterans talk about their experiences on the beaches of France. When you listen to those first hand accounts of the invasion then watching the very graphic opening scene of Saving Private Ryan....well...if it doesn't make you appreciate what those men did to rid the world of tyranny then something is wrong with you.The way the movie captures every level of bravery, from the guys who storm the beach with piss and vinegar to the guys who barely make it off the landing boats before breaking down in tears....it shows you every angle of humanity. And that occurs through teh whole movie. It doesn't paint all soldiers from WWII as super soldiers incapable of losing. It shows them for what they really were...a bunch of kids who wanted to do their duty and were scared of dying on the battlefield. It shows them making dumb mistakes because they weren't professional soldiers.It shows them as human beings, not unrealistic movie characters.It's an emotional story that will captivate you from so many angles. And it just so well made that it completely immerses you into 1944 France.Watch this movie. Then go find a veteran and give him a hug. He deserves it.	5.0	One of the best movies EVER made.	2014-06-11	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1C0A4R8M2XKAX	"""sleepyhollow9063"""	This film will always be remembered as the best war movie of the 1990's. It was one that threw away the old formula of a tightly made love triangle or love plot in the movie. It gets tight to the bone about the horrors of war. It gets deep into the soldiers feelings of the brutality of the dark and deadly live action game they took part in. Like Apocalypse Now its all about the horrors and rigors of armed men locked into a very hot and dangerous environment. each about a questionable soul searching mission that explores the true realm of the darkness of war itself. The only other movies that fullfills this mission besides Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and even some parts of Enemy at the Gates.	5.0	One of the best of all time *****	2001-12-12	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2MRUE7JM3XQM8	"S. LEIGH ""former National Guardsman"""	"Being a Army National Guard captain when I viewed this movie, I was very interested in the character Captain Miller, who is played by Tom Hanks. I found the way in which Miller balances taking care of his soldiers and carrying out the mission was very tough and brutal to his own psyche. Miller has to deal with the conflict between carrying out the mission and taking care of the soldiers, and he reveals how he does this to his sergeant.Captain Miller is obviously affected by the stress and horror of war, but he still is able to effectively lead. Knowing how soldiers act, I felt the movie was very realistic in the portrayal of the enlistedmen and the sergeant, played by Tom Sizemore. The enlistedmen are not yes-men, but are soldiers who carry out their duty with cynical views of their mission.With all his faults and sarcastic view, Captain Miller exemplifies an officer that does all he can to make sure that he carries out the mission to get his soldiers on ""that big boat home,"" in other words on the ship that takes the soldiers home to the U.S.A few years after this movie, I visited the American cemetary at Normandy. I felt a great gratitude to the soldiers that died on D-Day. This movie will give you a strong sense of admiration for those that served the United States in World War II, especially on the crucial D-Day. From hearing the historian Stephen Ambrose's remarks of how D-Day was like for the common soldier, this movie gives the most gritty look at what combat may have been like for the soldier on D-Day. This is probably the best World War II movie I have ever seen. Be prepared for very graphic violence."	5.0	Excellent look at leadership & tribute to veterans of WW II	2005-05-05	7	5	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A352X6XS8WYAJ6	spauls	Speilberg knows how to make war movies. Witness his excellent TV series &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;, and the even better &#34;The Pacific&#34;. This film is the winner of five Academy Awards and deservedly so. If you like war movies you will love this one. It is a graphic film though, especially the carnage at Omaha beach. A lot of gore. The story line concerns a squad of G.I.'s sent deep into France to extricate a lone soldier due to an executive decision based on a family tragedy. This film asks the question (and if this sounds like Spock on Star Trek it is where I heard it) &#34;Does the needs of the many outweigh those of the few?&#34; It is a well acted and action filled film about men sent to do a very dangerous job and questioning the rationale behind it. Hanks is his usual everyman best and the supporting cast is top notch. A great war movie but not for the people who cringe at the bloody effects. Highly recommended.	5.0	A Film Worth Saving	2014-04-10	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1OVSKQCT56NTT	Spiff	"I disliked many things about this movie, from parts of the plot to the sappy ending that simply sucked. An American flag at the beginning and an American flag at the end is not exactly the most original form of patriotism I have ever seen, while I am not born in the US and am grateful for USA's importance in the release of Europe (and the world), I doubt even Americans will find it the best of Spieberg's ideas. A smoother, more stylish approach would have been more interesting, after all, soldiers of many other nations (hey, even young enemy soldiers) fought in the same war and suffered and died the same way. Why end with a propaganda-looking-clich&eacute; and a pretty weak last half-hour?But that might be a matter of personal taste which is of no importance if I focus on the best aspect of this title: SPR has the merit of being the first WWII film to show the true reality of war. Almost any movie about WWII is far milder than ""Saving Private Ryan."" I remember feeling the discomfort of people when watching this movie, the audience didn't ""like it"", and people next to me were complaining how unpleasant it was, some kind of ""I can take it, but I wish I didn't have to see more of it"". It is visually disturbing. The sheer brutality of relentlessly violent and horrifying scenes goes on and on. Men froze in fear, cry like children, die, while commanders scream orders in the midst of thunderous explosions and torrential bullet fire.  Technically, the visuals are very good and the sound work is simply breathtaking, definitely essential to listen in DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1. You will miss a lot of the impact on VHS stereo. Chapter two is still a reference when it comes to digital sound.&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is probably the best and most powerful war film, not because of its plot or actors, but simply because it's honest most of the time, showing us the true  face of death, blood, and suffering. Other ""war"" movies and even TV coverage of computer technology making destruction &quot;surgical&quot; and &quot;clean.&quot; have led to the notion that war may not be hell after all.  Ryan eliminates any such distance between the audience and the reality of war, which is never surgical or clean, even today. To me at least, this movie's worth is based on its raw violence, the bloody, horrific nature of the conflict exposed with such realism.  This time we don't see war as glamorised as in other movies, there are no heroic or stylish deaths, no John Waynes.SPR is far from perfect, but even if you don't like the plot, or even if you feel discomfort while watching it and know you won't feel so good when it's over, you should still watch it simply because it sometimes pretty close to showing the true side of war; War, which is still part of our civilization, and as such, cannot be ignored even if it doesn't mix so well with our everyday life..."	4.0	Flawed, but still good	2001-01-07	8	4	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A34JPJLS1XX8XA	SRG	As war films go, this has got to be one of the best.  Its battle scenes are realistically frightening, and will make a pacifist out of anyone for at least a few hours afterward.  My only complaint is that the first 15  minutes make you believe that the entire movie will continue to be a war  movie.  Technically, it is because we're at war throughout the entire film,  but the movie wanders a bit, sometimes becoming too slow to keep your mind  from wandering as well.  It's as if Spielberg couldn't decide exactly what  type of movie he wanted to make.  As far as the rest of the film goes, the  character's stories are believable and compelling, except for (ironically)  Ryan himself but I wish the film was able to retain the same intensity as  when it began.  However, in the long run, it's a well put-together piece of  filmmaking that will certainly change your views about WW2 &amp; war in  general.	4.0	Excellent war film, but not always consistent	2000-01-03	1	0	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2UW83R0JOZZ6	S. Schell	I went to the theater to see this on a date. Bad idea for a date, because afterward I was so stunned and moved that I couldn't talk about it. The first twenty minutes of the film, I was completely breathless. It was a  walking nightmare, and a hellishly accurate depiction of what war must be  like. I wanted to cry, I wanted to beg for those men's lives, I was scared  and I was shaken. Never before has a movie affected me so deeply, and I  believe Spielberg was deprived of the credit he deserved for this  spectacular piece of filmmaking. It's definetely on my personal Oscar list.	5.0	There Are No Words To Describe How This Makes You Feel...	2000-04-16	5	2	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2RIHSEVZY6OG5	Stan Anvik	A few observations I've made after reading the reviews posted here...1. The sheer volume of reviews posted here undoubtedly indicates it is among the most talked about films ever made...which makes it an influential and  therefore important film...whether you liked it or not.2. I do not  recall seeing any WW II vets writing reviews here...which is consistent  with their silence about the war in everyday life.  My father was a prime  example.  He never  discussed any details of his combat experience in  Europe even with his wife or children.  Not in 50+ years...3. Nitpicking  aside, almost all reviewers agree the portrayal of war in the film is as  close to realistic as it has ever gotten.With regards to the third  observation, I believe Steven Spielberg has succeeded in accomplishing what  he set out to do...mainly, show the horrors of war as they really are and  remind people of the sacrifices made to secure our freedoms.To any and  all Veterans...you have my thanks and gratitude.I for one am grateful to  receive the reminder and thank god for people like my father who helped  save the world I have the good fortune to live in today.	5.0	Observations...	1999-12-20	8	6	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1D3ZM11YNH0FQ	"""stephenbelfield"""	I was very impressed by ths film.  I thought it would probably turn out to be rather cliched but it did seem to have a newer perspective on WW2.  Some people say the characters are stereotypical - well, I served in the  British Army Reserves for four years and my platoon had a fierce Scot,  joking Londoner, smiling Irishman and philosphical Welshman in it, plus me  as the token University Boy so I think you'll find that real-life Army  units can be like that.  No African Americans?  Since the US Army was  segregated until the sixties that is hardly surprising.  Caricatured  Germans?  Germans running away?  Well, some of them DID run away you know -  they weren't all ruthlessly obedient supermen, and some were no doubt far  more fed up with the war that the allies were.  It would have been nice to  see some British soldiers about but they were some way East taking out Caen  at the time, so again, not a surprise.  I wasn't sure about the film's  comment on Montgomery (&quot;overrated&quot;) and the British divisions  though;  Monty was a very good general indeed, at least as good as Patton  or Eisenhower, and if he was so overcautious then why did the British lose  so many men and tanks taking Caen?  I think you'll find that about 80% plus  of all the German armour in Normandy was at Caen, directed against the  British - not the sort of battle that can be won in an afternoon I'm sure  you'll agree.Excellent film though - the most realistic combat scenes  you will ever see on celluloid by far, and the plot is at least  believable.By the way, thanks very much to the US armed forces for doing  a fantastic job as our allies in WW2, and other times.  Long may Britain  and the US continue to stand up for freedom.	5.0	Very good War Film	1999-12-22	173	157	16
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3DEY6KZBNOHF1	Stephen B. Hughes	"Everyone gets wet over the opening sequence to this movie. Well, there are two problems with it for your consideration:1) It is a totally unrealistic account of the amount of time it took to win the battle of Normandy. To watch this crap, you'd think that the allies took the German positions in fifteen minutes!2) This sequence has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie! You could actually remove it, and the rest of the film would not be affected.By the way, Robert Rodat's script sucks, too. Witness that awful Ed Burns dialogue before the final battle. Also, what's up with ""Earn this""? No one in the history of the world has ever uttered a sentence like that! Total crap."	3.0	Read A Good Book On The Subject Instead	2004-08-20	18	5	13

Dont forget that its not a documentary,its a  hollywood movie. In my opinion, this movie was made beautifully. The action  scenes were amazing. The dialogue was very realistic and made you give a  damn about the soldiers. there are some seriously tragic and gut wrenching  moments in this movie. The gore was absolutely needed. the actors were very  genuine and played their roles perfectly. this is one of those movies where  you just sit down and have your eyes wide open the whole time.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1F9AJ13XUI70F	Stephen Stults	Every other aspect of the film has been critiqued ad nauseum, so I will only target this.  The one thing that truly disturbed me about Saving Private Ryan was the shaved heads of all the German soldiers.  First, it is historically completely wrong.  German soldiers typically had much longer hair than Allied soldiers, usually medium length on top but short on the sides.  Secondly, it really cheapens the film.  Since Spielberg obviously knew better, making the German soldiers into skin heads is just a cheap propaganda device.I really find it inexplicable as Spielberg seems so obsessed with accuracy in most other technical aspects of the film.  All in all, a VERY bad decision.	3.0	What's With the Skin Heads?	2011-11-08	15	2	13

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	I own the original DVD of the movie and just watched the Sapphire Blu Ray edition.  While I thought the original was excellent and with DTS audio, it should be, the Blu Ray is a worthy addition to your collection.  Without the need to summarize the plot, after all, this is not a book report, the video was without grain or noise at any point.  Even the darkest blacks and shades of gray were noiseless.  While I did not put on my original DVD, I recall that that was also a beautifully produced disc whose audio was outstanding.  The Sapphire version is certainly its equal and may be superior.  While still retaining the DTS HD audio and pretty much the same collection of extras, the use of the front surrounds was fantastic and the rear surrounds nearly as good.If you don't have a copy of this excellent movie, this would be the one to get.  It is rare , in my experience, that the original is as excellent as it is, but if you already have that, than I really wouldn't say that going to this blu ray is a must have.  Never the less, glad I got it.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	5.0	Saving Private Ryan-Sapphire Blu Ray Edition	2012-01-09	2	2	0

Just one of the many things that allowed the viewer to see  the war from a soldier's perspective was the depth of the characters.As  the movie begins to unfold the viewer begins to understand why each  character reacts to what is happening and his motivation to make it home.

I really never knew  how grusome WW2 really was (after all, I had grown up watching films like  &quot;The Longest Day,&quot; and &quot;To Hell And Back&quot;). The last  two hours, including the final fight scene, were truly some of Spielberg's  best moments ever captured on film. Violent it is, and the language is  awful. But, beyond that, is a moving story with characters who were  fighting to save ONE man. This will remain one of my ten favorite films of  all time. Should be used as a learning tool for High School American  History (So should &quot;The Patriot.&quot;). Bravo, Spielberg!	5.0	The Best WW2 FILM EVER! TRULY INSPIRING!	2000-09-09	3	1	2

I actually came away having greater appreciation for WW2 vets and what they had to go through. I also came to  know the importance of the battle at Normandy and what exactly was going on  during the most famous war in our history.Turns out Private Ryan's squad  had missed their drop off point by 20 miles. 20 miles?  That sounds like a  lot doesn't it?  That gave me an idea of how poor technology was as well  as how chaotic things must have been. How many other squads missed their  marks by double digit miles?The extra material on the DVD is great.  The footage of Spielberg's first war movies was definitely an eye opener.  He was able to create a pretty good movie with little more than his own  ingenuity and his Dad's old camera.Spielberg's Dad served in the war and  had brought back many pictures as well as fond memories. I did not know  that Spielberg was so knowledgeable about WW2.

However, I'm not writing this review to discuss the movie itself. Rather it's the poor quality DVD version that  has troubled me most.  As noted from previous reviews, this DVD has its  fair share of defects.  The abrupt pause during the ""Radar Station"" chapter  12 and the very poor picture quality during ""The Bridge"" chapter 19 after  the corporal shot the German guy.  Plus, the surface of the DVD bleeds with  brown nasty dye.  Almost like someone spilled coffee on it.Please don't  get me wrong, 98% of  this movie is just plain awesome.  I have the DTS  version and I have to say no DVD can even come close to the superior sound  quality in this movie.  The DTS version makes 5.1 look like child play.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26P248POMJ846	Steve Worral	Talk about feeling you were right there!  Spielberg did an oustanding job of recreating the horror, attrocity, ferocity and depersonalized violence of modern warfare. The film depicts the incredible heroism of the men on  the beach who were faced with nearly insurmountable conditions. It is no  small wonder that those who lived through such ordeals are often reticent  about what happened.  Yet these soldiers will carry these memories the rest  of their lives.	5.0	An incredible film	1999-12-03	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AR91O9J2ILVVZ	Stewart	&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, along with &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, is my personal favorite movie from director Steven Spielberg. The opening 25-minute D-Day sequence is one of moviedom's most memorable and realistic scenes ever. You feel very unsettled once it begins, and there's no letup to it. Tom Hanks gave, in my opinion, the best performance of his career as Captain John H. Miller. The screenplay is what I like best about this movie. There are only two war movies, so far, that have scared me and affected me the most: this film and &quot;All Quiet On The Western Front&quot;. The images in both films linger on in my memory. When Steven Spielberg makes this kind of film, he does it with respect for the men who died in WW2, just like he did for the survivors of the Holocaust in &quot;Schindler's List&quot;.	5.0	Spielberg's best, Tom Hanks' best, and the best war movie.	2001-04-12	2	1	1
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A39RCRNS2RXH0G	Stewy-baby	This movie is a true master piece. I found the picture and sound quality to be everything I hoped it was. Now I'm not much for widescreen, however once you start watching this movie you tend to forget all about it. This is  the first flick I bought and watched on DVD and I have no regrets. The  extra trailers and editorials are not much to talk about, but it takes  nothing away from the &quot;mind blowing&quot; sounds and special effects.  Definetly a must buy.P.S- DTS rocks.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A23A0ERHVM4HS6	Stingaree	Can I give it 6 stars.  Everything about this movie is compelling.  It starts off like a sledgehammer with the D-Day invasion itself in one of the most startling, riveting and shocking scenes in movie history.  And even though the rest of the movie cannot match that one scene in sheer intensity, it is still superb.You find yourself totally immersed in the characters and the dilemna that the film deals with.  After the movie was over I actually felt exhausted from the sense that I was right there experiencing the horrors of war.Adding to the intensity of the experience is the beautiful score by John Williams and the power of the sounds of war.  If you want to see a movie about D-Day and all that went into it, see The Longest Day.  But, if you want a movie that encapsulates the horrors of war and how it must have felt like on that fateful day, this is it.	5.0	Wow!	2004-12-17	10	8	2
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AYKM1B74OLEVC	Story Charts	"Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war. The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general: that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for: even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer: these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.Great film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.My major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are ""good"" from beginning to end and their relationships are ""good"" from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plotlines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle: the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca"	5.0	Brotherhood is worth dying for	2013-07-19	1	1	0

And you do not leave  until the end.Spielberg follows a troop of soldiers, each with  distinctive personalities or skills, whom you learn to like...until they're  killed. You'll root for your personal fav, hoping he'll dodge those bullets  or shoot that German. Sometimes they don't do what you want them to do, but  that just shows their character...war makes people act on instinct, a  primary one of which is fear. Spielberg truly plunges you into battle,  taking you right there beside them, with awesome sound and expert  cinematography. The colors are bleak and desolate, adding to the gritty  feel of the movie. I especially enjoyed the calm whitenesses that Captain  Miller experiences twice, as time slows down as he watches the chaos around  him. I haven't seen enough WWII movies to make much comparison, but this  one is filled with enough characterization, a cohesive plot to keep  interest, and gripping action to keep one entertained. And finally,  Spielberg answers the age-old question:Can one man make a  difference?Yes.	5.0	A realistic, gripping plunge into WWII	2000-06-23	1	1	0

The opening scenes of the landing at the beaches of Normandy are an awesome reminder of the hell that war is and the sacrifice that our soldiers paid to defend freedom.  I purchased the two disk sapphire series edition of Private Ryan because I wanted to experience the best presentation of what is probably the best movie ever produced.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2ARXDZRJVKF1K	Sven Oliver Roth	I saw the film when it came out in 1998. I was deeply impressed and moved by it. The first 20 minutes of carnage have earned this film a place in the annals of film history. Since then I have seen the film several times at home. And every time I watched it again I realized more what a mixed bag the film actually is.The film gives you a very authentic feel. But how authentic is it?The Allies lost more than 4000 soldiers on Omaha beach landing sector. You get a feeling for that.The Allies came in several attack waves in intervals of 20 minutes. The first two attack waves were basically wiped out to the last man. So you would either enter a virgin beach and play no role in the further movie - or you come in later and stumble across hundreds of bodies across the beach. In the film, however, its all one big attack wave.The battle on the beach raged on for 9 hours, not 20 minutes. You don't quite get a feeling for that one.The number of the German defenders at the crucial sector at Omaha beach was about 30. You guess you saw them all in the film. Or a few more actually...The thing that turned the table was not a few brave men blasting a gap through the barbed wire and fire a lucky shot at an explosives box (or whatever that was...) in the German sandbag position but the fact that finally Allied tanks arrived on the beach which destroyed the German positions. And those actually only finished off what the combined firepower of the warships off the coast hadn't vaporized yet. Several Allied destroyers ran ashore off Omaha beach alone while shelling the positions of the 30 Germans. The job of the GIs on the beach was only to be mowed down by the defenders until allied artillery had killed them all (except the 5 who managed to retreat).The battle towards the end of the film is pretty much a farce. Not only did such a battle as shown not take place at all, the behavior of the Waffen-SS soldiers is embarrasingly unrealistic. They run in single file through the city without trying to take any cover and without taking much effort even to spot the enemy.In reality small combat groups would have worked their way through buildings and basements and would have secured the city before any heavy armor would have been moved into the dangerous streets.The ahistorical skinhead-like haircuts of the Germans are probably an ideological point Spielberg wanted to drive home.While watching the stupid Krauts being mowed down by the dozen you keep asking yourself how they managed to conquer virtually all of Europe in the first place. You would never guess that in reality by the end of July 1944  the casualty ratio between Allies and Germans in France was 120,000 against 117,000 - despite total Allied air control and a vast Allied superiority in terms of troops, firepower, ammo and fuel.Summing up, the first 20 minutes wrote film history. The rest is often rather annoying.	3.0	Terriffic start, then Hollywod routine	2005-03-04	61	41	20

This film touched my heart like no other simply because of the way Spielberg portrayed his characters.  It is the kind of  film that I could not stop thinking about hours, even days after I first  witnessed this true masterpiece.  A true reflection of the films depth is  the beach massacre at the begining of the film, and how they managed to  sustain the high level of realism and entertainment throughout was  incredible.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AV9C368MSLWY	tad@aol.com	Haunting...memorable...gut wrenching...sobering...that's Saving Private Ryan. It gets right to the heart of the horror of war and never lets up. It is a moving tribute to my parent's generation, many of whom paid a terrible  sacrifice for our freedom. It made its point directly and  succinctly.Saving Private Ryan is not an entertaining film. It wasn't  meant to be. It is a wake up call. It is a reminder. It is also about  rising above adversity triumphantly, adversity in many forms.  It is  compelling viewing. With its touch of Hollywood heroics, it is also classic  Americana.I have seen it in the theater and numerous times on my new 50  inch tv and each time I feel humbled and battered and yet I come back for  more. The first time I saw it, I was haunted for a week. Then I found I  wanted to know everything I could about the film.I notice some Amazon  reviewers denigrate the film with their griping and nitpicking. I find this  to be petty and inconsequential to what SPR has accomplished. Most of us  already know the accomplishments. Yeah, I'm also aware of some of the  imperfections, the most notable detraction to me is the near vilification  of German soldiers. OK, so name me a perfect film. For those who think The  Think Red Line is better or perfect, try again. I understand and appreciate  TRL's attempt to touch on the horror of war, but it was too convoluted to  be effective.I hope the producers elect to release a &quot;directors  version&quot; of SPR soon. If you've observed the film's overall editing  (I's just the slightest bit abrupt in a few places) as well as the ending  creditrs, red the novel, or seen photos of the movie, you will have noticed  the likelihood of footage which was not included in the curent 2hr and  50min version of the film. Maybe the producers wanted to keep the running  time down for the first go round.Steven Spielberg has created a  masterpiece wich will stand the test of time. It is simply one of th finest  films ever made. By the way, have any armor enthusiasts out there noticed  the small, sprocketless front drive wheels on the Tiger tanks in the film?

Since I am younger in additon to Japanese, I have not known about D-DAY very much.And I have thought ever that D-DAY is USA military's overwhelming victory to Germany.But in the intro of this movie, the thinking that I have held was reversed, that is, the scene was USA's tragedy that USA was assulted from Germany in hills when USA landed in Ohama beach. Because I had the question that the story was truth? I examined about Ohama War in inter-net. And I understood that the tragedy was truth. I was very surprised.And I was very surprised about that the movie's making skill was wonderful. For instance,to the bullet's sound effect in the landing scene of Ohama I very surprised. The sound was very real. As if I existed in Ohama. Concretly the bullet's repeling sound to miritary's protecter, and explosion sound of bombs.Not only intro's Ohama scene but also in last scene I was moved very much, that is, an offensive and derfensive battle in the bridge. That scene was very real. Especally the scene that a tank come in the town where USA force hided. The skill of making film, that is, in farst I heared the caterpillar's sound of the tunk and in next heared the talking sound of Germany's militaly, and finally in far place the shadow of the tunk..For the moment that the tunk was coming, since I was very nervous I sweated very.The movie makers must have known about techniques how to take a film for exciting audiences. incredible.From first to last, that was a movie that I was moved.Thank you for reading my poor English.	5.0	I was moved very much.	2004-03-16	11	10	1

However, after reading several WW2 history books, I found this movie to be extraordinarily inaccurate. D-Day was a symbolic turning point, but the outcome against Germany had already been determined. I agree 100% with the reader from Vancouver on March 15. &quot;Ost&quot; troopers, children, and crippled vets were manning the coast defenses and the German Army was already decimated from its Eastern Front Campaign. I guess this realism would have confused the audience. The most horrific battle of WW2 was Stalingrad, but that has still not been addressed properly by mainstream Hollywood.

One of the soldiers fighting is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him. His hands say it all: an uncontrollable shaking.  Soon after the battle, Miller is given a mission: seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers. A fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to America. With his team members accompanying him, Miller starts his search for Private Ryan (Matt Damon).This is not an easy mission because very single man in Miller's crew knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of Normandy. Private Reiben (Edward Burns) believes that Private Ryan is not worth saving, at the cost of their lives. But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan. However, Ryan refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the German army. With the assistance of the surviving team, they take a stand against the army. The ensemble cast is briliantly orchestrated by Spielberg; first and foremost is Jeremy Davies, who plays Corporal Upham, a very feeble but somewhat poetic soldier caught in the chaos. Davies' portrayal would be scene stealing if the rest of the cast wasn't so stellar, as the audience will certainly be able to identify most easily with this character. Hanks combines the perfect mix of wisdom and physical brutality in Captain Miller, a man who is equally haunted by the mission at hand and with what awaits him back at home. Matt Damon, who plays the title character, is very effective in a somewhat brief role which requires him to be both emotionally and physically strong whilst being sympathetic to the audience. Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel round off the top notch cast, and not a single player is anything less than perfect.Much has obviously been said about the battle sequences, especially the brutal realism which they contain. Not only are they perfect in the technical department, but when viewed in the simple context of ""men trying to survive"" the scenes are absolutely heart-wrenching, and equally unforgettable.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" leaves an unmistakable imprint on the mind, where even those who dislike the movie will not be able to forget it. It is a wholly unique cinematic experience and one which should be endured by anyone mature enough to handle it. It transcends the medium to truly become a work of art, and it holds a rock-solid place in cinematic history."	5.0	Saving Private Ryan  (1998)	2005-12-29	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2Z1EQXT699P1Q	THOMAS A. BIALKOWSKI	After repeated viewings of this film, I've come to the conclusion that this film is really two films in one. The first film is a thoughtful, powerful and grim view of US Infantrymen in WWII. Here soldiers fight and  die with a speed and, even more powerfully, a casualness that I don't think  has ever duplicated in film history since the original, 1931 version of  AQOTWF.  These scenes of men at war have all the more impact, since there  is none of the stupid gratuitousness of the &quot;60's&quot; and  &quot;70's&quot; in the graphicness at work here,i.e. slow motion blood  spurts, etc. Though the overall premiss of this film is a streching of  history, the strength of the men who make up the Infantry Squad make it  seem believable, most of time.  The second film is as phoney and artifical  a depiction of war that hasn't been seen by a US audience since John  Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS. Here men talk aloud while scouting behind enemy  lines, stack arms and cache their weapons although they are cut-off for  days by enemy troops, and officers condemn the decisions of their superiors  while standing in front of enlistedmen. What a shame a man with all the  billions at his disposal as Spielberg felt it was nescessary to include so  many &quot;WWII&quot; movie contrivancies while paying tribute to the  &quot;WWII&quot; generation. The one only gives insult to the many  sacfifices made by the other.  It would seem a line from Shakespeare would  do well here:&quot;...THOU HAS CUT MY HEART IN TWAIN...THROW AWAY THE WOSER  HALF AND LIVE ALL THE BETTER WITH THE OTHER&quot;. Even with these and  other flaws, seeing this film in a theatre, during its intial release, was  probably the most power film experience I've had since my teen years. The  tragedy of this film is that,with Spielberg's finances,it could have been  the greatest film about war ever made instead of merely a great war film.	4.0	A FLAWAED MASTERPIECE	2000-04-11	2	2	0

The crime is that this was not the Academy Award Best Picture of the Year.  Instead that year the award went to Shakespeare in Love; an easily forgotten movie that doesn't stand up to qaulity of Saving Private Ryan.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2V2XRUGEYYCGG	Thomas Glebe	"Though I liked this movie overall, though there are some outstanding shots, sequences, and effects, and though I would probably recommend it to friends and acquaintances as one of the better cinema treatments about World War II, my expectations were too disappointed to engage in high praise of this work. I had many serious ""problems"" with SPR from the very opening overtly false patriotic flag scene to the very end.The opening scene of Ryan as an old man visiting the Normandy cemetery was fine except for one very annoying factor, John Williams, lush, overly-sentimental BS musical pretensions, which we've heard 100 times already, and in almost every scene in which this score swelled, I felt it was inappropriate. I would've much rather have heard no music whatsoever throughout the film, or at least a very subtle form of and use of.  I don't really like being manipulated like this. And various scenes do this.  A lush musical war, no thanks.The most striking example of the film's almost soulless failure to do justice to its apparent agenda and real blood and guts reality (to show how utterly abominable real war is), brings me to yet another complaint. The films' cinema verite, shaky documentary camera style. NYPD Blue on amphetamines...A little of this ""style"" can go a long way. Drenching entire scenes lasting several minutes, was totally ineffective and pretentious to me.  Some of the wobbly camera in the opening sequence, was very potent, like the troops running towards the beach. This gave the viewer a real sense of being there, of being in a frantic state of confusion, attempting to move forward into a frightening and imposing blur of horror and motion. However, a bit later, when Hanks and his men are using a mirror at the end of a rifle to try to find out where a particular German machine gun is firing from, why shake the camera? When the medics are trying to fix up wounded men on the beach, why shake the camera? If one were there watching these things, they would simply not be seeing it from this perspective. Again, this whole technique was so overused to me.What's so disappointing about SPR is that it just could've been done so much better, in so many areas.  Long, boring, unimaginative sequences are followed by Hollywood hokum.  The truly outstanding radar attack sequence, stood out.  The characters were given a REAL identity to me during this portion. But for all the talk (hype?) of blood and gore and entrails in SPR's beginning, to me, the only really powerful depictions of real war in the film, was specifically in the segment when one of the GI's chests was pumping gushes of bright red blood, in addition to some opening shots.Why wasn't there so much more of this however?  Why not show utterly horrible pain and suffering and death?  That which is real war?  That which is happening even as I write this, which I hope Spielberg or one of his other cronies may deal with in the near future, about Iraq.  Holding my breath, but not too long.The entire Axis prisoner scene, was good. There was a real tension here, and I easily felt myself not watching a movie anymore, but feeling as if I had some sort of personal stake in what I was watching. In SPR, Spielberg's more delicate and subtly discriminating add-ons, were clearly the best moments of the film. All the blood and violence and special effects of the opening and closing sections (the closing sections having nearly as much power as the opening ones), never came close for me, in displaying the real horror of war, than this one little middle section, which culminated in two men on the same side, almost killing each other because a ""bad guy"" POW was being released.There were and are WAY TOO MANY shots for me of Americans mowing down whole groups of German soldiers, like as if this was a standard scene out of WWII (it wasn't). It IS a standard, stereotypical scene out of WWII MOVIES however. I had hoped for much more however, in SPR. Otherwise, in Spielberg's fantasy WWII world, whole German squads can easily be mowed down by a single GI, and tanks and other weapons can be disabled with nothing more than some good old GI Joe bravery. For all the effects, for all the blood and guts that ARE shown, SPR continually refuses to step over certain lines. It wants to be two things at once, which is its ultimate undoing, to show the ""reality"" of war, but to do it in an entertaining Hollywood story suited for mass consumption.I have to say this film, like digestible war-movie filler candy before and after, satisfies for awhile, but there are no great ideas here, no true moral or political or philosophical ""center"" or soul. And there is nothing groundbreaking here except for a few FX enhanced ""war scenes.""  There are much better WWI&II; films, of all stripes.  I'd suggest ""Enemy at the Gates,"" or ""Paths of Glory,' or even the low budget ""A Midnight Clear.""  For starters.This is a fairly good war film, but not a ""great"" war film. DVD extras aside.  What the film clearly does wrong, cannot in the final analysis, overcome the few things it does really great and right. Entertaining? Yes. Transcendent?  But only if one is easily prone to hype, political, or cinematic, or falsely (IMO) ""patriotic"" propaganda.  This viewer is none of the above, and in the end, to me is just another Steven Spielberg misfire, which garnered and continues to receive critical/popular praise truly undeserved, compared to so many other much more worthy WWII films.  As well as documentaries.  I wish the whole script had been rewritten/filmed, concentrating on D-Day alone, and never diverted into a corny, schmaltzy retread of almost any other good or bad WWII flick since, or afterwards."	3.0	A good but not great, WWII film...	2007-09-05	14	5	9

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A30OXD42ZFYZLO	Thomas Keneally	"Spielberg's movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"" was considered by many as one of the greatest war movies. It has a very thin story line, but is a typical hollywood version of WWII. While it shows how bad war can be along with the comradeship, leadership and the bonding in war, it is a long line of war movies that glorifies the allied struggle and adds too much melodrama.Let us start with the Omaha beach battle. The biggest flaw here is that they try to take the beach without any air or sea cover. Any one who is well versed in war would tell you that if you try to take a beach without cover, you will suffer heavy casualities. No army would commit such a tactical error. If you have good cover, then there is a good chance of taking such a beach. This was a mistake in the movie. Spielberg has not done enough research before putting together his movie. He should read authors like Ian McEwan who went to the British War Museum library and did their research before writing books like ""Atonement"". Basically the movie while well scripted uses patriotism and some good acting to capture the audience. It follows a long list of World War II movies that are not even handed in their portrayal. I guess that since most people do not read about the war itself, they see the movies and accept that as the reality. Rommel took Tobruk with 70 tanks, it was thanks to some clever maneuvering by the British that he did not take Alexandria. He was 40 miles from there, he lost because he did not get his supplies in time, not because he or his army was not brave or clever. Luck has a lot to do with winning, as was said by Napolean.I am tired of this one sided movies that portray the glories. The Germans lost a lot due to their own follies and things like the offensive against Russia, Barbarossa, cost them heavily due to the bitter cold. No one mentions this in the movies. Even when the German High Command asked Hitler to retreat, he would refuse to do so. That was his mistake. He had an uncanny way of sizing up his enemies and only in the end he overreached himself. I am glad that he lost, but it is due to a combination of circumstances. There were more Indians in British army who lost lives than Canadians or Australians. This is never mentioned in any movie. India lost close to 100000 people in WWII, but thanks to their color, they are not considered important. They served in British armies all over North Africa and Europe. They fought some of the fiercest battlest against Rommel.I am tired of this hollywood stuff that cranks out the same genre in different form over and over again. I wish that they realize that people would like to see more than the same old Tom Hanks stuff, it is getting overplayed. One reviewer said that this was probably the best movie except for Braveheart, that goes to show how little people care for veracity and more for fluff. I recently saw one documentary that showed two Jewish men from Czeck republic who had been through the holocaust who went back to the concentration camp they came from. One of them mentioned that one of the SS men hated his job so much that he rather be transfered to the army in the eastern Europe, which would mean certain death. Few holocaust movies ever mentions such an incident, as they always want black and white. Movies about war also should portray some even handedness. Otherwise, it is farcical and boring."	2.0	Decent movie, overrated	2004-09-09	22	7	15

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3RDZG3H21G9WK	THOMAS V GAGNON	The 2 battle scenes at the beginning and end of this movie are just incredible filmmaking feats by Spielberg and company and one should have this movie just to see them. And Tom Hanks is great, as he usually is.But there are serious problems in other places. Some examples: the  opening in the cemetary is a cheat, Private Ryan's obviously ad-libbed  &quot;ugly tree&quot; scene is a disgrace and having Miller even consider  not accomplishing his mission at the end was a terrible plot judgment by  Spielberg.I haven't seen too many movies that have left me divided  between admiration and dislike as SPR,  so the best advice I can give is  that it's definitely worth owning and probably no one short of Spielberg's  genius could have assembled it, but program a &quot;good parts&quot;  version into your DVD player. Give him a huge amount of credit for making  such a difficult and brutal movie when he could be taking it so much  easier.	3.0	some great scenes but too many awful scenes	1999-11-02	1	1	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2RYJNOOCA94K3	Tina M Hynes	My grandfather drove a Higgins Boat to Omaha Beach on D-day, I believe the sector of beach was &#34;easy green&#34; from his transport the  USS Thurston (AP-77). He was still alive when this movie came out and I saw it in the theater and told him about it. He had no desire to see it just as he had no desire to be around fireworks &#34;they sound too much like the real thing&#34; he would say. When I described the opening scene of the film he expanded on things he had told me when I was a child. 1000 yards off shore the waves churned red with blood,  as soon as his ramp lowered half the men on his craft were shot in the first wave, they started going over the side struggling with weighed down packs. He returned to the Thurston after the 1st Wave only to be told he had to go in the 2nd wave because they had lost 3 boats and their coxswains in the first. He honestly believed he would die , he was 19yrs old, he had volunteered at 17 and left for boot camp on his 18th birthday. I would say based upon the first hand account I heard of the landing by  him that that opening scene is very accurate.  The rest of the movie is a story and I have no way to gauge how accurate it is, but I feel at least the beach invasion gives me a glimpse of the horror my grandfather witnessed as a very  young man an event that helped shape the wonderful man he became and also drove every decision he made morally, politically and ethically the rest of his life. D-day was just one of four invasions he had a front row seat for.  He was 18 at the North African invasion and  20 in the last at Okinawa . It just amazes me the horrors these very YOUNG men endured and survived for the most part so well.	5.0	Great movie about the greatest generation of Americans to ever live!	2013-05-15	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A31EZZ14E0IIME	Tom Harrison	It is ironic that today's youths, myself included, happily play computer games based on the events in this movie, and somehow fail to realise that this really happened.Saving Private Ryan depicts a company in the US Army during WW2 venturing deep into unprotected line to recover a soldier who's three brothers were all killed in action. It is a confronting film, as the soldiers must deal with homesickness and the death of their 'brothers' within their company. What you see will shock and scare you, but ultimately will give you a look at the horrors of war.Tom Hanks is brilliant as Captain John Miller, a smalltown school teacher turned war hero, and the actors who play the soldiers in Miller's company are unforgettable. Perhaps most memorable is the performance of Jeremy Davies as a cowardly translator thrown into the frontline, as he faces his greatest fears while in combat.Saving Private Ryan is an incredible film, which will stay with you forever as we who never witnessed the horrors of World War 2 develop a greater understanding of the most important battle of the 20th century.A wonderful DVD, full with Spielberg's touching reflection on D-Day (6/6/1944) and interviews with men who were there in France when these events really happened.

I can remember seeing this film in the theatre when I was about fifteen and my friends and I sat very close to the screen.  We were eating candy and popcorn and soda long before the movie started.  We goofed off and did stupid things before the movie and honestly I was expecting some kind of an action movie or something.  I was sorely mistaken.  After about fifteen minutes into it I realized how hard this was going to be to watch, I think I even got a little sick from sitting so close and eating a bunch of candy and junk before the movie even started.  There were also two veterans in front of us who shortly after the movie started began to sob.  I could hear them crying in the darkness and it made the movie even that more emotional for me.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2TRCD7Y6O21OE	Tom Lund	This film always reminds me how fortunate my family is that our father, a US Army combat engineer with the 1st Special Engineer Brigade landed on Utah Beach under fire on D-Day, 6 June 1944. If he had landed on Omaha Beach in the first wave as graphically depicted in this film, he would have likely been lying there dead when Tom hanks and his Ranger company arrived.  The combat engineers were largely slaughtered on Omaha. The first 30 minutes of this film are unusually sobering to watch, just like they were in the theater when I first saw this film when it was released. I wept just like most folks did in the theater but I did so since someone that I loved dearly had to, in reality, walk and run into the German machine gun and artillery buzz saw as Tom Hank's CPT John Miller did. I had asked my Dad, who passed away ten years before this film debuted, a million times &#34;what was D-Day like Dad?&#34; when I was a kid and I felt ashamed of myself for doing so since every time I did he had to let go of the memories he was trying so hard to suppress and not give into like all combat veterans do. After seeing those first thirty minutes of this film, I didn't really need an answer anymore.if there is a flaw in this film it is the seen where Vin Diesel's character Caparzo is killed by the German sniper while they are having a screaming match over the little French girl.  I used to watch the TV show &#34;Combat&#34; as a kid with my dad and he would always tell me how they would do things in the show that would get you killed or at least wounded if you had done them in real life during the actual war, like walking down a road or across an open field - you would always hug the tree line and roads were likely mined, and on and on. I can only imagine the ferocity of his reaction to that particular scene in this film, since I thought of him  during it and his combat gained technical advise immediately. other than that gaff, and it is a gaff, this is an excellent film as has been stated thousands of time since 1994. I just wish my Dad could have stuck around a little longer so he could have seen it for himself.By the way, GEN Omar Bradley did a great but unintentional disservice to all of those brave men who landed on Utah Beach by describing it as a :&#34;cake walk&#34;. It wasn't. Fortunately, the pre-invasion aerial bombardment of the beach and the German positions behind it was more successful than it was on Omaha but they still took a lot of casualties, both KIA and wounded. Utah Beach was also the one that &#34;Ike&#34; worried about the most due to its relative isolation from the others.  Fortunately the men of the 101st Airborne, in particular the 507th PIR  whose storied accomplishments were chronicled in the Ambrose book and the HBO Series with the same name ,&#34;Band of Brothers&#34;, saved my Dad and the lives of lots of other GI's by spiking the guns that were shelling them.  Those guys are big heroes of mine and I actually sent their Regimental Association a thank you email that basically read...&#34;On behalf of my two sisters, my brother, and myself, I would like to thank you all for allowing us to be born&#34;.  They reply I received from them, since they had apparently never received a message like mine before, made me weep.This film set a whole lot of good things in motion, including Tom Hank's incredible &#34;The Band of Brothers&#34; series, that email from me that resulted from my seeing it, the response to it I received that apparently warmed the hearts of some elderly &#34;Screaming Eagles&#34;, and even greater admiration for my own Dad and the thousands of other Dads that came to not to conquer, but to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny 69 years ago. God bless each and every one of them and thanks again Steven!!!!	5.0	Little left to say about this film	2013-12-18	0	0	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2V89VNTTDDREC	Tonson Man	"I'd love to address just one issue in the film (I have watched the DVD version of ""Saving Private Ryan when it first came out) - and that is the number of soldiers walking on the field before and after Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) was killed in a French village by a German sniper.With my keen eyes, I noticed the total number of soldiers (including Captain Miller) on their way to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) was eight before they reached the French village where Private Caparzo was killed.  However, I was surprised that the number of solders (again including Captain Miller)was still the SAME - eight!I think Spielberg or whoever was in charge must be ""careless"" in this regard.  It may be that Spielberg used the same footage before and after the death of Caparzo, to save money I guess.Overall, I love this movie.I'd love to know if Spielberg has fixed this error in the film before I consider upgrading my DVD version to Blur Ray.  I'm kind of a perfectionist, especially when it comes to collecting Spielberg's impeccable films.Please, anyone, let me know if Spielberg has fixed it in the Blue Ray version."	5.0	Has Spielberg fixed this yet?	2011-02-14	10	0	10

Speilberg has created a true masterpiece, with unforgettable images of the atrocities of war, BUT, basically this is a human spirit tale  told expertly.  It is difficult for today's audience to understand the  impact of WWII on this country:  women joined the work force fully, mothers  DID have childcren dying in far away places, brides waited years to see  their husbands return safely home. But, spielberg's film is not about the  homefront, he takes us to the battlefields of France (actully filmed in  Ireland) and it is a remarkable journey.  i urge every man and woman to see  and feel this film the way it was meant to be seen, but if you can't get to  see it on a theater screen: this dvd incarnation will make you think you  had.	5.0	The only DVD I will ever need	1999-11-03	1	1	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2PDD9MXCDM3ZM	"Tony L. Engleton CNMT ""Tony L.Engleton  CNMT"""	"I first saw this movie as a rental, in the comfort of my own living room, with a modest stereo system for the sound.  I could not have imagined, then or now, the effect of the big screen of a theatre.  The opening 20 minutes are as real and gutt-wrenching as any I've ever seen.  Steven Ambrose stated that WWII vets of D-DAY said they never thought they'd see their efforts portrayed on film with such stunning reality.  Some openly wept at a special screening.  Still others purposefully left their seats for the refuge of the lobby.  Old wounds re-opened.  While the individual personalities of the search squad present a mixture of pragmatism and stubborness, at various moments and, in the climactic battle, they individualy show us their deep dedication to their mission, their unit and, most of all, their brothers.  I am seldom at a loss for words but this is an exception.  My emotions rumble within me whenever I view this movie, and how I wish I could meet one of the men today, just to shake his hand, look him in the eye and say ""thank you, sir.""  If you have never seen this film, boy, how I envy you!  You are in for an experience that may be life-changing.  I will close with this thought.  Somewhere, there is a similar story, though not necessarily a like-minded plot, concerning the soldiers of WWI.  These were men too, Germans, French, Belgians and Americans.  They had homes in the country, grew up on farms, had moms who worked at local hospitals and taught literature to high school students.  Perhaps some day, Spielberg, or someone almost as good, will tell their story as well, because after all the parades, after all the saluting, after all the political maneuvering, war is still, and always has been, about the duty, honor and valor of the man at arms.  So, to any of you who actually may have been at Omaha Beach, Anzio or Iwo Jima, I say to you, sirs, God Bless You, and, to your fallen comrades, don eis requiem, sempiternam."	5.0	OUR FATHER'S VALOR	2006-11-17	18	14	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A19ABW3S9KCDOR	"""top_cat1980"""	When I first went to see Saving Private Ryan at the cinema I was impressed. Extremely impressed. It hits you with a massive initial impact which takes a long time to wear off. After repeated viewings the cracks begin to show. If you took away the film making methods and the raw grittiness of the battle scenes (ie. the first 20 minutes and the denoument) you would be left with a fairly mediocre war film.The characters are fairly weak. Make that very weak. In fairness, Hanks' character is solid (and the bit with the pool on what he does in civilian life works well). The others are largely cardboard stereotypes which touch all the bases in standard Hollywood fashion. None of this is really a reflection on the actors involved, so much as the result of a fairly weak and ultimately unadventurous script.The storyline plods along. It really does. Apart from the occassional sudden eruption of extreme violence (though arguably this is in fact a realistic reflection of most wartime experiences - 90% boredom, 10% sheer terror). In doing so it manages to work in every cliche in the book. In terms of drama and quality of story there is NOTHING that hasn't been done before.That is where the irony lies really. Saving Private Ryan features battle scenes which take the shooting of war films to a new level. In other ways it's a clear step backwards. The blood and guts and actual slugging it out may be a lot more realistic than all the various creaky 1960s and 1970s three-hour war epics, but once you get beyond that Saving Private Ryan ultimately rings far more hollow than many of its predecessors.	3.0	Initially impressive, ultimately unsatisfying	2003-04-06	13	9	4

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1EIDFUDCWT20D	T. Roberts	We cannot begin to understand why Dreamworks & Paramount would release this blu-ray!  The video quality is supposed to be better on blu-ray than DVD but in this case, IT IS NOT! Not only is it not better, it's downright horrible!  The picture is downright grainy and the lighting in many of the scenes is very streaky and... well, just horrible!  In the very beginning you can see how grainy it is when the guy is walking into the cemetery with his family.  We thought at first, maybe they meant to do that?  The next very noticeable mess-up is when they gain control of the beach.  The light coming off the fires streaks way up & down the screen.  Next is when they realized that Private Ryan was the last of the brothers in the office where they are typing the letters for the family.  When they meet inside the closed office, the light from the windows makes the whole screen faded, like a backlight issue.  After about an hour of messing with my Blu-ray players settings and the TV settings with no luck, we looked at the reviews & find that others have had the same problem.  I noticed someone saying something about the color of the barcode... We have one with a yellow barcode so that does NOT mean it's a corrected version.  Unfortunately we didn't watch it right away so we couldn't return it to Amazon. :o(  We are very disappointed in the studios for putting this movie out, when they know it's messed up.  Is this something the did on purpose so people would have to go out & buy it again, if they want a quality copy?  Just bad business whether that was their intent or not.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AZKIJ6KPI5WKO	"Troy J. Martin ""frustrated Yesfan"""	"A brilliant but flawed masterpiece, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is ultimately no more than a series of encounters seemingly derived from previous war drama.The switch between two styles of cinematography is jarring and distracting. While that may be the point, as far as I can determine, ""Band of Brothers"" is better and more consistent visually, as a reference.The shocking, blood-and-guts opening D-Day sequence shows war at its most brutal and heroic, and is the best part of the movie. The remaining portion of the movie seems to contain plot points lifted from the old 1960s series ""Combat!,"" (the sniper, the machine gun nest, holding the bridge, etc.) which pulled them off far better and with more engaging acting than ""Ryan.""However, any man with any heart at all who watches to the end will be weeping.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A21AW4TNF12PTK	TruxtonSpangler	For anyone interested in military history, this is a must-see movie.  It's not perfect; an argument can be made for chopping out the last scene at the cemetery to improve the movie.  It also fluctuates between being anti-war and a straight war movie.  But the acting is superb, the battle scenes are fantastic and Tom Hanks deserved an Oscar.I have seen cuts of the movie -- usually on HBO -- where the editing could have been better.  In the climactic battle at the end of the movie, there were some clear editing miscues:  When Sizemore's running back over the bridge, from two different angles the camerman is in the frame.  And when Ryan (Damon) shows Miller (Hanks) how to arm the mortar rounds and toss them, a grenade is clearly seen on Miller's belt as he's heaving the much heavier mortar round.  I would think the grenades would be easier to use.Still, this is one of the best war movies ever filmed.  It's just not perfect.	5.0	Saw this in the theaters six times	2013-05-05	0	0	0
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AEBZVNKHJNJHU	"T. SIMPSON ""amazon man"""	I had seen all kinds of war films before sitting down in the theatre to view this film.  But I have to say that I  could barely sit through the first 30 minutes, it was so intense. Knowing that it happened like that, and even worse, was almost too much. I nearly walked out.  Nearly.  A rare experience for me a the movies.  My problem wasn't that I thought the gore was overwhelming, churning my stomach.  It was that I was nearly weeping, sitting there knowing that people actually went through that.  I can think of no other film that has had that effect one me.  It made me appreciate the effort of our fathers and grandfathers much more.  Isn't that the intent of the film?In short, it's the story of a captian, played by Tom Hanks, who leads his squad in the D-Day assault at Omaha Beach.  They then get an assignment to find a Private Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper dropped somewhere inland during the invasion.  They have to bring him back and send him home alive, because he's the last of the Ryan brothers alive out of the four sent out to war.The acting is good.  There's enough dialog to get through the story, but it's the story and journey that count here.  Would they have sent six or seven men out, wandering around the French countryside until they found one man?  That's debatable, but don't let the question spoil the story.  This is about following orders, compassion, duty to country, family, and comrade.The technical details are top-notch.  Bullets and explosions act like the real things.  The settings are incredibly realistic with bombed-out buildings and the rubble of war.  And the sounds couldn't be better.  High quality filmmaking throughout.This gets five stars and a buy recommendation because it's one of the best war movies ever, and one of the best-made movies ever.  I own the DTS version, without all of the extras, so I can't comment on them.	5.0	Put on your flak jacket, helmet, and hit Play	2002-12-18	3	3	0

The squad that this movie follows is fictional (sorry based on true story fans) but the war is very very real.  The opening scene of omaha beach by all accounts is about as accurate of a potrayal of D-Day in Normandy as you'll ever see.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ALKHRV8WIQ0R8	Tyler	This is, by far, the best film I have ever seen.  Everything, from the actin to the score to the direction to the cinematography to the speical evvects to the character development to the script ect. far surpass  anything else produced in 1998.  Spielberg uses such realism that we  acutally forget that we are watching Tom Hanks, one of the most  recognizeable faces in the world today.  Hanks too deserves credit for  fitting his persona so well.  He is less the &quot;Gung Ho!&quot; John  Wayne and more the nervous Lew Ayres from &quot;All Quiet on the Western  Front.&quot;  However, Jermey Davies successfully steals the show from  Hanks and other great preformances by Ed Burns, Tom Siezmore and Giovani  Ribisi (Medic Wade).  Davies shows us a sort of everyman quality; a vision  of what all of us would do had we been put under those circumstances. This  film has such a realism (despite one &quot;Hollywood&quot; plot twist) that  almost makes us tink everything is real.  Upon reminising about the film, I  can't help but ask myself &quot;was that really a movie?&quot;  There is  almos a documentary flavor to this film.  The jargon the men use, the way  scenes are shot (many with hand held cameras)and the washed out color all  add to the documentary look. Speilberg's dirrection leaves the film  looking, sounding, and feelig complete.  With this film, his career will be  colmplete, it will be tough for anyone (even Speilberg) to top it. If you  don't have Saving Private Ryan, buy it; you will be pleased with what you  get.	5.0	The BEST film of 1998- A must have for everyone	2000-01-27	2	1	1

It is more violent, gritty, and brutal, but &quot;Platoon&quot; just hits home with me. Anyway, this film set a new notch in realism and quality for war films. Since this was made, several films have tried to recreate it's intensity. &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Windtalkers&quot;. They all have come somewhat close, but yet they have not reached SPR. The use of the camera in combat shots, with the dirt, blood, and debris on the lens adds to the feeling of being there and the realism. If you watch any of the above listed war films, you will notice the blood, dirt, ect. on the lens. These films are trying to follow SPR. The acting is as good as it gets. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in history. He is terrific. If you love war films, you must see this film. You will always remember it.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A26UW8DNN74AGK	"""unhelpful"""	After watching the film Saving Private Ryan under unusual circumstances (unusual for a filmgoer, but ideal for the makers of the film), I have read several reviews, critiques, and otherwise anecdotal notices of the film  which have forced me to reconsider my own opinions and to question the  humanity of the opinions of others.  Granted, we are talking about a movie  - albeit a particularly clever one - and not about history as we choose to  remember it.  But, in purely personal terms, as an active duty soldier in  the United States Army, who watched Saving Private Ryan in a theater full  of other soldiers in Korea, whose father fought in the European theater  (not at Normandy, but at Bizerte, Anzio, etc.) during the last World War, I  must admit to a degree of deracination when I read the comments of many  others.  For instance, many have voiced their displeasure at Spielberg's  use of the contemporary framing device (the old man visiting the cemetery  at Normandy).  I have even read of a few viewers identifying with Upham -  the cowardly translator, who chooses to fire on the enemy only once they're  disarmed and asking for mercy (after he witnesses - and doesn't lift a  finger to prevent - the slaughter of his comrades).  My failure to quite  grasp the lack of comprehension of this film - which is, first to last, an  elegy for saviors of the world &quot;as we know it&quot; - stems from much  more than my &quot;biased&quot; perspective as a serviceman.  Bill Maher,  in one of his fits of lucidity, commented bitterly on the WWII generation:  &quot;They saved the world.  And today nobody gives a damn.&quot;  History  is unbearable only because we choose never to learn anything from it.  And  when some viewers fail to see the difference between this particular battle  and virtually any other (such as one from the Boer war), it is obvious  history has taught them nothing.  Spielberg wasn't attempting to teach us  anything we didn't already know.  He was simply attempting to italicize one  moment in history, in the middle of a gigantic slaughterhouse, so that the  generation of men and women who probably came closer to saving the world  than any generation before or since, could be recognized for their supreme  sacrifice, as well as their supreme achievement.  Watching the final scene,  with the now aged Ryan asking his wife if he's a good man, if he's led a  good life, I saw my father standing there, clearly and resolutely, saluting  those that had fallen so that he would live to memorialize them.  Spielberg's elegy is perfect in tone.  And it moves me to see it again and  again.	5.0	Saving the World (and Private Ryan)	2000-05-28	7	6	1

This is a great film and highly accurate in its depiction.Overall, I highly recommend this one without hesitation. Well done film.	5.0	Too realistic. Action-packed, bloody and gory.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A2Y9LNCHINRUYU	Uri Feder	This film Does have a &quot;bad reason for it's existance - four brothers, three killed, mission: to find the fourth.. bla bla...... an old man crying on an unknown grave and a corny ending. How ever, Speilberg, A visuall  Genouse, has all the talent and love of film to make every thing els work.  A 23 minut sequence opens the film (after the grave yard) with the most  violant, horrifing and realistic battle sequence I have ever seen on film.  Not much inteligante diologue in the film, just war, and alot of it. No  mercy in visuals, and alot of pain in between. Tom Hanks giving great  peformance of an officer who is human as any of us, trying to find a way  home through the true horros of war. It's one of those films that you don't  realize that there was a director and actors making this movie. You just  sit in the theatre and experience some thing that is horror in the deepest  meening of the word.	5.0	The pain of war on film	2000-01-29	4	1	3

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1NTXJPTFP1G03	"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian"""	"Lately, when Hollywood produces war movies, they focus on the debacle ofVietnam.  Not director Steven Spielberg!  Instead, the incredibly versatile helmer of ""Jaws,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Color Purple,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" impales a patriotic chapter of American history on a bayonet with his graphically realistic but otherwise sappy ""Saving Private Ryan.""  ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as a second-rate World War II movie with a first-class cast and top-notch production values that pass inspection with some of the most savage combat carnage ever lensed.  As demeaning as this criticism sounds, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the top 25 World War II movies.  Unfortunately, the film contains so many glaring historical inaccuracies as well as wholly improbable plot contrivances that you wonder what Spielberg was thinking when he made it. Since ""Saving Private Ryan"" swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action, Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" and Sylvester Stallone's ""Rambo"" have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence.If the story had been as memorable as the kinetic, blood-splattered battle scenes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" might have been a classic.  Essentially, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a ten-star movie until the U.S. Army gets off the beach and into France where it devolves into just another standard-issue G.I. Joe war epic.  Anybody who knows anything about combat movies will cringe the first time that they see the hero parading about in a helmet with the captain's bars painted on the front like a bull's eye.  This is an egregious error!  During World War II, officers didn't advertise their presence in this manner for fear that an enemy sniper would single them out for a bullet in the head.  Okay, I'd dismiss this lapse of realism as a dramatic liberty except the filmmakers raise the same point.  A seasoned dogface (Vin Diesel) warns a rank amateur to stop saluting the captain for fear that a sniper will shoot the captain down.Dispersed throughout the movie is the usual quota of Hallmark speeches about valor, loyalty, and redemption.  These platitudes add little dimension beyond the obvious to the purely physical rat-a-tat-tat.  Spielberg could have trimmed much of this sappy dialogue and upgraded his movie.  Running nearly three hours in length, this rowdy, often profane World War II melodrama creates a deeper impression with is grotesque special effects than with its drab, sometimes improbable tale.  Consider the scene in the town when the wall collapses between the Germans and the GIs and they stand with their arms brandished screaming at each like a Mexican stand-off.  Come on, give me a break, in real life, either side would have opened up on each other.  Similarly, letting Steamboat Willie go is another incredible lapse of believability.Told from the perspective of the infantry, ""Saving Private Ryan"" shares in the grand tradition of Louis Milestone's classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" Samuel Fuller's ""The Big Red One,"" Lewis Milestone's ""A Walk in the Sun,"" and William Wellman's ""Background.""  Granted, none of them boasts the extreme combat that ""Saving Private Ryan"" commands, but they are solidly-made, engaging war movies with deeply personal stories.  The muddled but high-minded screenplay by ""Fly Away House"" scenarist Robert Rodat follows a unit of U.S. Rangers on a dim-witted public relations mission to rescue an American paratrooper.Captain Miller (Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"") assembles a collection of stock characters to help him locate 101ST Airborne Paratrooper Private James Ryan of Iowa.  Ryan (Matt Damon of ""Good Will Hunting"") has gotten lost behind enemy lines in the pre-dawn parachute drops that preceded the June 6th D-Day Normandy Invasion.  When the War Department discovers that Ryan's two brothers bite the sand at Normandy and that the Japanese have killed a third sibling a week earlier, General George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell of ""Fargo"") decides to pull the last Ryan out of action.  Along the way, Miller's G.I.s complain about the irony of risking eight lives to save one guy.Before ""Saving Private Ryan"" grinds to its sanguinary conclusion, the Biblical theme of singling out an individual from a multitude for redemption grows tedious.  Spielberg and Rodat, along with uncredited scribes Scott Frank and Frank ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Darabont, seem confused.  Are they making a fiercely repellent anti-war movie?  Or have the drummed up a gung-ho Hong Kong style, kick-butt actioneer?  Theypile on enough violence for a platoon of war movies.  Bullets zip and zing by the hundreds giving death an impersonal omnipotence.  Presumably, the filmmakers hoped their grisly depiction of combat would eviscerate the memories of those flag-waving John Wayne propaganda sagas.  The sadistic horrors that occur in ""Saving Private Ryan"" seems more commercially than philosophically oriented.  We don't think so much about how terrible war is as how miraculous it is to survive.The first 24 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" dwells on the famous D-Day landing at Omaha Beach.  Spielberg shows the baptism by fire that befell the seasick G.I.s as they waded ashore into a murderous Third Reich shooting gallery.  This is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics.After the scary, visceral D-Day prologue, the film settles down long enough for Miller to receive new orders.  Eventually, Miller locates Ryan with a bunch of paratroopers guarding a bridge behind Nazi lines.  Ryan refuses to leave his buddies in the lurch.  Reluctantly, Miller and his squad prepare for the worst.  This part of ""Saving Private Ryan"" has a lot of action, but it cannot compete with the 1960s ABC-TV show""Combat.""  Tom Sizemore makes a credible sergeant, but the usually dependable Edward Burns plays a soldier that would have been shot by his own men for disobeying orders.  Tom Hanks' former teacher turned combat leader is a little too sentimental to be believable as is his inevitable demise.  Many soldiers have commented--among them retired Joints Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell--that Miller and his men should have blown the bridge and retreated.  Of course, had our heroes shown this much common sense there would have been no climactic battle.Spielberg relies on elaborate visual gimmicks to strengthen his screen activities.  The astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera.  The only thing that saves Spielberg is the politically incorrect way that the G.I.s shoot the surrendering Nazi troops.  ""Saving Private Ryan,"" for all its obvious flaws, still qualifies a movie any die-hard World War II fanatic should watch at least three times."	2.0	Deeply Flawed, Inaccurate Portrayal of World War II, But Entertaining As A Big Dumb Actioneer!	2009-02-23	23	8	15
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AAEWZVQJNBZN7	"""vaoy"""	I read into this movie much like I did Steven Spielberg's &quot;Schindler's List&quot;; framing a World War II story from a Jewish perspective. &quot;List&quot; was more obvious than &quot;Saving Private  Ryan,&quot; but some of the major themes carried over, and two of them  were:1. The Holocaust ... Adam Goldberg's character was the Jewish  member of the Ranger unit assigned to find Private Ryan. In a montage of  scenes toward the end of the film, when a million things seem to be  happening at once, Goldberg's character and a Nazi soldier physically fight  each other, by themselves, apart from their comrades, and it seems, from  the world around them, that they are alone. The Jew dies, but not with a  gunshot would (like how many of the war's soldiers fell to), but a knife to  the heart. I found this symbolism extraodinarily disturbing, yet effective  in the way that within a matter of seconds, the destruction of European  Jewry was played out on film.2. Disbelieving the truth ... Jeremy  Davies' character was not an original member of the unit sent on the  movie's unique mission. Instead, like the United States, he joins after the  fighting and killing of WW II have already begun. That was part one of  Davies' symbolism, but part two symbolized the majority of people in Europe  (and, indeed, around the world) during World War II who did nothing to help  their Jewish neighbors and countrymen. In a scene that takes place at the  same time as Goldberg's character is being killed, the Davies' character is  curled-up -- almost in the fetal position -- unable to face the realities  of war around him, and unable to move one way or another; a neutral between  two sides, the Nazi who killed the Jew walks right by the newcomer barely  pausing in notice of him.Indeed, there are many ways of pointing out the  greatness of this film. It will be appreciated and understood by anyone who  chooses to do so.	4.0	From a Jewish Perspective	2000-05-31	9	7	2

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AJGYL949GRYAY	Viator Veritatis	This movie, like many American productions (with the notable exception of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and some parts of &quot;Platoon&quot;), is a farce.First of all, many scenes of combat are totally unrealistic. I could produce a long list of inconsistencies, but I shall content myself with mentioning the obvious ones. The first 20 minutes are very well shot with hand-held cameras and represent the best part of the movie, but even then the shifting fortunes of the fight are conveyed showing only American losses at the beginning, then -- after the destruction of the main bunker -- only German ones. There usually was no hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. In one of the most ludicrous scenes, a wall crumbles and two groups of soldiers - one American and one German - caught in the act of planning strategy in adjacent rooms, look at each other and challenge the enemy to surrender for long seconds before somebody starts firing. This is science fiction, point.The final battle in the town brings in the worst of the movie. No competent German commander would move two Tiger tanks straight in the town (where every window could hide a sniper armed with AT weapons), in violation of basic WWII tactics. After entering the town, the German squads usually advance in a single row, at minimal distance from each other and without providing suppression fire, allowing the Americans to mow them down. Spielberg even provides the viewer with a furious hand-to-hand fight with drawn blades between an American and a German soldier, rolling on the floor in a death embrace - he could supply them with swords, shields and maybe a few spells to cast at each other, and his effort of imagination would be complete. The ways the Tiger tanks are destroyed are also unrealistic.If that were all, the movie would only be childish and unrealistic. But, typically, Spielberg has the vulgarity to convey a moral message (rather than encouraging the viewer to formulate his own answers). He purports to convey two kinds ofmyths: a pacifist and an anti-nationalsocialist one. That he does in a most insipid way, reviving the standardized stereotype of the &quot;plebeian hero&quot;, or, to express the same concept in different words, the &quot;citizen soldier&quot; celebrated by another popular historian and upholder of the religion of human rights &amp; mass democracy, Stephen E. Ambrose.The standard American tactic in France consisted in withdrawing their troops at the slightest sign of serious resistance, levelling the area with fighter-bombers and artillery, and then advancing on the rubbles. That would be a realistic portrayal of war on the Western Front, but, of course, it would hardly be a celebration of the virtues of the American crusaders, come &quot;over there&quot; to liberate their brethen from the chains of racism andoppression. That's why the citizen soldiers - all ordinary people with no military traditions or special penchant for patriotism - suddenly discover extraordinary qualities of courage and willpower within their hearts, choosing to sacrifice their young lives in behalf of the Cause, and offering a (once more, totally unrealistic - in the real world fifty elite SS troopers armed with heavy equipment and supported by Tiger tanks would effortlessy wipe away Ryan's small detachment) long and hardened resistance, till the forces of Good - in the Happy End of standard Hollywood tradition - come and rescue the lone survivor.I would like to compare this movie with Nazi or Communist (or -- Taleban!) propaganda - it's stupid, it's popular, it works in impressing moral feelings on the herd's minds. And has lots of expensive special effects and is commercially successful -- a typically American movie in true Spielberg fashion.	2.0	Downright stupid	2001-11-08	21	8	13

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1686H7Q24XZ3E	Vincent Toolan	Two generations have grown up since the D Day landings. Steven Spielberg has done society a tremendous service in vividly bringing to life the horrors we have been spared. Those moments which would have died from  memory with the men who endured them in 1944 are made real again - within  the confines of the silver screen.This film deserves much of the  criticism it has received  regarding the story and script. For instance,  the clumsy device of bracketing the narrative's start and finish as an old  man's flashback at the cemetery is saccharine, and especially annoying to  British viewers (although perhaps necessary context for young Americans).  But to dwell on these quibbles is to miss the point. Spielberg has created  a masterpiece of cinematography, not of literature, and more than any other  contemporary film I've seen he uses the medium to the full. Attention to  detail is astounding - listen out for the eerily convincing sound effects  of bullets on steel girders in the opening landing scene.Above all, you  finish this movie convinced that what you've seen reflects meticulous  research in reconstructing participants' accounts of real events - and  technical brilliance in making it real.

The men who fought this war were true heroes and forever will be. I think every generation should pay tribute to the soldiers today and tommorrow who die willingly for our freedom. Spielberg has accomplished something with this film that touches upon both American pride and on the humanness of war. The scenes on the Normandy beach will reach in and grab ahold of your heart; torturing you beyond belief. But then pride will well up inside that same heart and your entire being will cheer as the first soldiers scale the hill. The movie just continues from there with scene after scene of triumph and terror with a storyline that will match the action in intensity, something rarely found these days.I hope you will watch and say a prayer for all those souls who fought so bravely for American freedom. Remember those who fight today and hope that it isn't in vain. Spielberg is a master director who believes in the truth and shoots his movies with conviction.

Spielberg's hand-held in your face film technique immerses the viewer into  the action. Without a doubt, Speilberg's depiction of the landing on  Normandy Beach is one the most intense battle scenes ever filmed.It is  no less than a sheer masterpiece of filmaking. It is a well-researched,  authentic anti-war statement that stands as a tribute to those individuals  who endured horrific circumstances and literally saved the free world from  tyranny.Saving Private Ryan accomplishes what Schindler's list did in  regard to the holocaust and what Oliver Stone's Platoon accomplished in its  statement on Vietnam.In addition, Spielberg has not only paid a  deserving tribute to the veterans of World War II, he has also produced an  excellent anti-war film that deglorifies warfare. There was nothing  romantic about being butchered on the battlefield. If there is a hell, the  D-Day veterans have already been there.Saving Private Ryan is without a  doubt one of the most honest, realistic combat movies ever made. Although  Spielberg may not have gotten it all down in regard to the war with  Germany; his depiction in regard to Normandy Beach and D-Day are right on  target!	5.0	Saving Private Ryan DVD: Definitive Movie on D-Day	1999-12-30	76	57	19

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A22AIAFY9X5D00	Warren V Thoms	It is unfair to say that 'saving private ryan' is the greatest D-DAY film  of all time. Its quite simply not. The first 20 mins or so of the movie  (set on Omaha Beach) is the only scene actually dedicated to the greatest  day in modern history. No movie could ever exactly portrait the happenings  of June 6 1944. A few arms and legs being blown off does not qualify this  film for being the 'most accurate'. The events leading up too and during  this great day are a story within themselves and for those with a limited  knowledge of world war 2, i expect that the script must have been very  confusing. Im sure that many who have seen the film had not the faintest  idea of what was going on.I would have to agree that the opening battle  scene is quite possibly the greatest ever made however that does not give  it the right to be compared to other movies such as the 'The Longest Day'.  Its main plot is vastly different. Im sure that Stephen E. Ambrose would  have been a little disappointed (as many veterans were) with the story line  of Saving Private Ryan for the simple fact that there were countless  factual happenings on D-DAY with enough content to film a hundred movies.  Tom hanks was brillaint (again) as Captain John Millar though i thought  some of the other acting led a lot to be desired. I am thankful that  Davies, Speilberg and Ambrose have helped to keep the brave and unselfish  feats of our countrymen alive for some time yet. A great film on the whole  yet i do suggest if you are indeed interested by D-DAY that you read a good  book on the subject.	4.0	Please dont compare	2000-08-02	2	0	2

From the opening scenes to coming full circle in the closing scenes, Saving Private Ryan is a movie and emotionally draining film that leaves you analyzing your own life to determine if you have led a life worth the sacrifices the men and women of our armed forces have made.Speilberg has created another masterpiece.  Just when I thought he could not create a movie more vital than Schindler's List, he comes up with Saving Private Ryan.  I cannot say enough about this film.  If bloody realism is not something you can stomach then move past the initial Normandy invasion scenes.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3CFT5LHFCB46K	"""weirdo_87"""	"To start off my review, I would like to answer those who complain about this film ignoring the British and not having African Americans or other minorities in the army units.Yes, the British did have a major part in World War II and there were many British and Canadians, as well as Americans, present at the Normandy landings. But a few reviewers have already mentioned that Omaha was invaded by the Americans. And, as someone mentioned before, Brits weren't exactly commonplace in an American Rangers Unit. As for the minorities, American units were still very much segregated in World War II.But, I do agree with other reviewers who mention the slanted portrayal of Germans in this movie. Some have blamed this on Director Spielberg's Judaism. While I can't agree with that, I will say this: The German troops in here reminded me of drones. They were cold hearted and brutal. None of them thought of killing without hesitation and, above all, they weren't human. They were also easier to eliminate then the Americans (With the exception of the opening scenes), despite the fact that they were probably elite German troops (They seemed older, bigger and tougher then many of the Americans). However, hasn't this been seen in war movies for decades, dating back to John Wayne WWII movies or films like ""The Guns of Navarone"" and ""The Dirty Dozen""? It's pretty ridiculous to downgrade an AMERICAN war movie because the soldiers on the other side are easier to kill then AMERICANS. Basically, historical movies, especially those made by the United States, aren't the best history teacher.The greatest question posed at the end of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is was it worth it. Was it worth risking the lives of eight men just to save one, basically unimportant man just because his brothers were all dead? Contrary to some reviewers, I think the movie was showing that it wasn't worth it. Most of the men in the squad sent to save Ryan were killed and the survivors would have been slaughtered had it not been for allied reinforcements. Even Tom Hank's John Miller seems skeptical as to whether it was justified: His last words to Ryan are ""Earn this. Earn it"".My only other compliant with the movie was in who survived on the American side. I'm not complaining about Ryan, but about the other men in the squad sent to rescue him, of whom just two survive. One is a cocky private (Edward Burns) who can't keep his mouth shut. There is a tense scene where he tries to leave the squad and gets into a shouting match with another sergeant, played by Tom Sizemore. Sizemore pulls his gun out and threatens to shoot him. I was hoping that he would put the bullet in his big mouth. The other survivor is a very well educated corporal who's bilingual in German and French, which is why he was brought along. Yet he isn't a good solider because he's easily shaken by battle. Granted, not everyone can be a tough guy underfire (He isn't really a soldier either. He was a mapmaker and translator beforehand). Still, had he showed more bravery and courage in the battle in the French town (He had a thirty caliber with a full belt, for pete's sake), at least two others in his squad would have either been saved or would have had an advantage against the Germans. He was also very much within firing range of the Germans through most of the last battle. Not until the battle's end does he finally have the guts to shoot someone. His character's action seemed based on those of Lt. Joyce from ""Bridge on the River Kwai"".I also somewhat agree with those who question the military tactics. A squad of American soldiers is in dangerous, heavily occupied nazi country, yet is bunched up closely together talking loudly. Ridiculous, no doubt. But again, this is Hollywood. It's better film wise to have the actors placed this way. And during these walks, we learn more about the men and about their opinions on the mission and the war.That said, this is an excellent, powerful war movie. The battle scenes are stunning and, while ultra violent and perhaps made for action movie buffs, they make one hope that we or the ones we love are never have to be in those situations. However, while this movie depicts the D-Day assault more brutally than any other, the early war epic ""The Longest Day"" shows a wider overall coverage, though with less bloodshed (Since censors wouldn't have allowed it at the time).

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	Yes, the opening scene at Omaha Beach is riveting.  The problem is, they put it at the beginning of the movie, and it's all downhill from there.  The rest of the movie is mostly a mishmash of contrived dialogue, forced acting, and cornball speeches.  I find its depiction of war quite inaccurate, with its apparent message that war ennobles its participants and brings out the best in soldiers (and includes lots of moving oratory by guys like Tom Hanks).  Quite simply, that isn't true.  I found &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; to be much more accurate portrayals of the psychological impact of war.  And while the opening battle scene is good, if I want a ton of violence, I'll watch the far more entertaining &quot;Commando.&quot;	2.0	Boring and pretentious	2002-03-04	11	4	7
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1BDUIQQHIAAI7	whitewash	This movie was definitely just like real war: Short bursts of action followed by long stretches of uneasy boredom.While the opening set piece was certainly busy, I still couldn't help thinking, &quot;Gee, so this is  what a John Wayne movie would've looked like with whiz-bang special  effects!&quot; Unfortunately, this film suffers from the same defects as  those old war movies. Way-too-old soldiers, &quot;evil&quot; German  adversaries, overly romanticized death scenes, and that done to death  &quot;ragtag band of misfits behind enemy lines&quot; plot. This is the  type of story a ten-year old would come up with if you gave him a  two-dollar bag of plastic army men.An entertaining, if somewhat  sluggish, war fantasy? You bet. History? Hardly. Where are the generals,  with their noncomm servants and comfy digs, calling the shots from the  safety of HQ? Where are the clueless eighteen year-olds who don't know that  they've volunteered to be used as cannon fodder? Where are the British, who  were literally fighting for their homes and families?In the final  analysis, this movie has the same fatal flaw most war movies have. No  matter how horrific the battle scenes are, you still come away with a good  feeling about the sacrifices that were made. And as long as that is the  case, there will be no hesitation to make those sacrifices again. Enjoy it  as a patriotic fantasy, but don't call it a history lesson. If you want an  idea about the reality of war, I would suggest reading All Quiet on the  Western Front, Slaughterhouse Five or Johnny Get Your Gun.	2.0	Just like real war...	1999-11-26	53	13	40

The level of 'hooray for the good-guy' sentimentality and Camus and Sartre philosophy is sickening. Real people did not spend their free moments between death and mayhem philosophising about the existential meaning of existence, that would have made death pleasurable by comparison. Also, the contrived plot devices (the shaky hands of Tom Hanks, among other things) nearly drive this movie into the ground. It's as if Spielberg said ""Hey, let's do something to make the audience relate to the character again, I think we're losing them. I know! Let's do the shaky hands thing again!"" Granted, visually, it's disturbing, the first 20 minutes are enough to make you ill (if you can get past the cheap bait-the-viewer trick Spielberg does, also totally unnecessary), but the acting and dialogue are worthy of the 40's serial war films (You know: ""I'll do it for Ace, and Little joe and stinky!"") Spielberg historically oversentimentalizes and cheapens incredible films in order to try and force meaning on them and 'gasp', yes, even make them more marketable to the masses who don't quite get Kubrick films. If only he'd do art for art's sake, he could be Fellini or Bergman. You want to see a movie that truly captures the cold, surreal, impersonal aspects of war without forcing a mantra a reason for it, see 'Full Metal Jacket' and think about how that film, with it's sparsness of violence in comparison, pulls of a much better effect. The real horror of war is not that you kill hundreds of faceless Germans, but that you kill one person, and their face never leaves your mind. Ideologies can't ever compare to blood on the hands, and Spielberg lets that slide."	2.0	The print and sound are excellent, the plot and story stink.	2000-03-27	10	5	5

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1PIJUS839OZSU	william l scott	the best, most realistic war movie ever made - an emotional gut-wrencher, with combat scenes as close to the thing as could possibly be done. It's also a wonderful character study, especially Tom Hanks' Capt. Miller, who so epitomizes the kind of &quot;civilian soldier&quot; who was so important  to the winning of that war, the kind of officer who doesn't care about  promotions or covering his butt or getting his ticket punched, whose only  concern is getting the job done the best way it can be done and getting the  hell out of there in one piece, back to his wife and his career and the  &quot;real&quot; world - exactly the sort of officer who was so  conspicously missing 20 years later in Vietnam. (Hanks almost certainly  would have won an Oscar for this, except there was no way the Academy was  going to give him 3 Oscars in the same decade, no matter how deserving.)  Anyone who has had a relative in combat, especially W.W.II, should force  themselves to watch this movie, at least once, just to see, just to get a  small glimpse, of what it was really like.	5.0	best war movie ever	2000-04-22	3	2	1

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	"I go back and forth on my feelings about Steven Spielberg as a director.  I gushed pretty blatantly about Artificial Intelligence, but on reflection (and several more viewings) I think I was just relieved that he didn't screw it up too badly.  Now, I find my review faintly embarrassing.  Oh well.Saving Private Ryan has taken longer to percolate.  It's great achievement (one worthy of study by film students) is the Omaha Beach invasion on D-Day.  My God, what a terrifying sequence.  It is, perhaps, the single best sustained action scene in recent memory.  Only Kurosawa's devastating castle attack from the middle of Ran eclipses it for sheer apocalyptic horror.  It is war as abstraction; the newsreel style a metaphorical fan brush loaded with pigments of green, khaki, and red as it feverishly, even angrily paints its canvas.Other scenes work well, also.  In spite of other reviews denouncing the ""false moral dilemma"" of the captured German soldier and Jeremy Davies' too-soft translator, I believed that most of the guys under Miller's command would, indeed, want to kill the German prisoner.  I do.  I also believed that someone would probably point out that killing him would do nothing bring back their campadre, and would, in fact, be illegal under the Geneva Convention. Scenes like this, the showdown with the sniper in the bell tower, Caparzo's death, and the long night in the church mostly work - even when the spell is broken by the occasional Oscar Speech (patent pending) from Tom Hanks.  By and large, the scenes were well handled, with thoughtful dialog and subtle acting.But, alas, Spielberg could not overcome his ultimate weakness - sentiment verging on unadulterated corn.  The book-ending scenes are insulting in the way they ask us to believe not that General Marshall would send soldiers in harm's way to rescue Private Ryan, but that he would do it for sentimental reasons.  My complaint is not with actor Harve Presnell, who delivers his lines with great conviction, but with the very idea that a man in his position would actually value the life of a single man over the lives of many.  That equation does not wash.  Such a mission is realistic (the film is based, we are told, on fact), but the reason behind it would almost certainly be one of propaganda value.Imagine if Spielberg's late friend Stanley Kubrick had made the film: Mrs. Ryan gets telegrams telling her that all but one of her sons are dead and the last is missing.  She explodes in anger and grief, forgetting that her sons died to save the free world and focusing instead on her own loss.  She calls the papers, she raises a stink, the AP gets hold of the story.  Now Washington takes notice and leans on General Marshall - can't we do something to shut this woman up?  And thus starts the mission.But no, that would be entirely too realistic.  It's not that Americans NEVER send rescue teams to pull lost soldiers out of harm's way (remember Captain Scott O'Grady?); it's that the calculus for launching such an operation hinges on a great deal more than how much the powers-that-be get all dewy-eyed over the thought of sending another telegram to the parents of a soldier.On balance, though, Saving Private Ryan is still a film worth owning.  The technical achievement is undeniable; isolated scenes are brilliant.  It's just exasperating to see Steven Spielberg sometimes lose his nerve, stop trusting the strength of the material, and go for the sharp stick to the tear-duct."	3.0	An amazing achievement, but not all that great	2003-01-04	8	4	4

Great job and a fitting tribute to those who died trying to liberate Europe from Nazism and Fascism. Extremely well-done and a great movie. Makes me tear eyed when the army car comes by to notify Ryan's family of their sons' death. The acting is great and the visual effects are very well-done.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	A347MRCA48RV4J	wiser consumer	"My military experience was limited. I joined the Army Reserve in 1956 right out of high school just to satisfy my draft obligation, went to Fort Leonard Wood, MO for six months of training, then did three and a half years of one-night-a-week meetings plus two weeks of summer camp once a year. So I'm no battle-hardened veteran.But in this film, when I heard the German machine guns open up on the GIs coming into Omaha Beach, I thought, ""That's the first time I've heard the actual sound of machine guns firing since my days in Leonard Wood."" This film is probably as close to the real thing as you're apt to find. It makes the old John Wayne film ""The Longest Day"" and its depiction of that landing look like a Sunday stroll in the park.Normally I avoid films that're violent, figuring they arouse human passions best left dormant. But I've added this film to my library because it's an accurate portrayal of just how stupid and cruel we can be to one another. And to what purpose -- I want your stuff and you want mine? It's like two-year-olds fighting over the same toy, but then two seconds later the winner could care less about that toy and is off to the next. We are a ridiculous and heinous species, the scourge of our planet, and this film does a very good job of showing it."	5.0	Real	2011-09-12	2	2	0

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	ALSPQLL2YMF4	Woody	Although the proceeding description is often used and rarely substantiated; Saving Private Ryan is a landmark film.The visuals are among the most haunting ever filmed, including a now justly famous opening  battle scene which has set a new standard for battle scenes in war movies.  There has not been a more accurate depiction of a battle, than  &quot;Ryan's&quot; take on Omaha Beach.But the movie's brilliance does  not stop at the technical wizardry.  The performances are heartfelt and  memorable, and the largely unknown cast (for now), is absolutely  superb.Leading the way is of course Tom Hanks in, not his best  performance, but a great one nonetheless in its understatement and quiet  dignity, very well worthy of his Oscar nomination.  Also noteworthy are Tom  Sizemore as a dependable, eternally loyal lieutenant, Jeremy Davies as a  not-battle-ready translator, who is integral to the most haunting scene of  the year.This is an excellent movie the should not be missed.  It is  expertly directed, acted, and scripted(a fact which was underrated).No  matter what the Academy says; this is the Best Picture of 1999	5.0	5 STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH	1999-12-06	11	7	4
B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AKCYGOHDG141A	W. Roberts	Spielberg may be our most infuriating director. Parts of this movie are just spectacular, from the super realism of the opening segments, landing on the Omaha beach, to some really precious intimate scenes during lulls in battle between the soldiers. Superb ensemble acting.  I suspect the script writers got all that dead on right. But Spielberg is never satisfied to just give us a simple story well told etched in harsh reality. He has to add his layers of schmaltz and syrup, like that's the only way we can consume this stuff. It really drives me nuts. So we end up with this manipulative schmaltz throughout the movie, beginning with the John Willams score (will someone please shoot him and put us all out of our misery?) and continuing with the conceit upon which the plot is built. Give me a break. No general is going to send eight men--highly trained Rangers no less-- to their likely death to find one lousy guy. Sorry Mrs. Ryan. Then you have the cemetery scenes at beginning and end, and the Norman Rockwell shot of the Iowa farm house and the Norman Rockwell shot of the typists banging away letters of condolence and the flag waving in the breeze not once not twice but three times. This stuff is an affront to the real heroism otherwise portrayed. Puhleeze....I liked this movie and I absolutely hated this movie, or what Spielberg thought he had to do to it. No wonder Americans are becoming sniveling vapid sentimentalists who can't tell real from false.	3.0	Saving us from Spielberg	2005-06-13	30	20	10

Soon enough assault crafts carrying US Army Rangers land at Utah Beach Normandy France,D-Day. As soon as the ramps open,US Rangers were being cut down mercilessly by MG fire from German bunkers. Rangers including Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) rush forward to take cover behind anti-tank barriers,as the MG barrage continue, now with mortar shells exploding all over the beachhead.Soldiers were torn apart by the shell fragments.US Rangers succeeded to hold the beach, after the heavy firefight with many casualties. The beach scene was really intense, showing you the cold hard reality of combat action during war time.Captain Miller was told by his superior officer to go deep into Normandy to look for Private James Ryan (82nd Airborne Division)and bring him back as his three brothers were KIA. Captain Miller thus assemble a squad of his men plus a translator Corporal Upham(Jeremy Davies). His squad consists of SGT Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Pte Reiben (Edward Burns), Pte Jackson (Barry Pepper), Pte Mellish (Adam Goldberg),Pte Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and Medic Wade(Giovanni Ribisi). Most of the squad were carrying standard issued M1 Garand with exception Cpt Miller (Thompson M1), Sgt Horvath (M1 Carbine), Pte Reiben (BAR : Browning Automatic Rifle) and Pte Jackson (Springfield M1903 with scope).Won 5 Oscars in 1998 including Best Director (Steven Spielberg) and Best Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski).Contain graphic war violence and gore.	5.0	Covering Fire !	2010-04-06	6	0	6

It doesn't look Speed Racer or Dark Knight good, but what they did to clean up the visuals give it a stunning makeover.  The sound on a 5.1 Dolby system will make your ears tingle it's that good.  Now as far as the story and all goes for those who may not have seen it but have heard of it before - This is our generation's (18-35) war movie.  For some it was Rambo for some it was Full Metal Jacket, this takes the violence of Rambo and takes it to the 10th power.  There was originally talk of pulling it from theaters it was so violent.  It's not over the top Sin City or Kill Bill violent though, this movie aims to show you what it's really like when a bullet hits you or a shrapnel grenade explodes in your vicinity.  In short it makes you realize war is hell and leaves you wanting to never experience it.  Also to the youngsters who may read this review and look at it as a boring Tom Hanks movie, nothing like it at all.  If you have ever played a WWII FPS this is where they all got their inspiration from, seriously there are scenes from Call of Duty, Brothers In Arms, and Medal of Honor that are ripped straight from this movie.

B00000K3AM	Saving Private Ryan [VHS]	AYTBAXJ2Q958V	YogaGurl	"I am so glad Spielberg made this film.  D-Day really happened and it's important for us to recall or be shown what really happened - even if we find out through a movie.  It's important for us to recall the tremendous bravery and loyalty soldiers have shown so we could live free and in comfort.  Those men of that generation were truly a great generation...selfless and willing to fight for what they felt was right.  Even if a war is started for duplicitous reasons (and I don't think WW2 falls in this category) one must remember that soldiers, for the most part, are acting from the heart..from virtue to fight for what they feel is right.Some other reviewer said that there was no good reason for this film...but I heartily disagree.  It was real...it happened and we should know our history and the sacrifices others have made for us. Many people will never read any account of what happened.  They will only learn via movies...I'd rather have a movie about it than nothing at all.  We need more appreciation for the sacrifices previous generations have made.  The only reason we are allowed to say ""war has not solved anything"" is because others have courageously gone to war.  I don't like war...no one does...but we can't deny the fact that it has eradicated some evil in the world. It's just the truth and this film has shown it.

In the movie Saving Private Ryan, the soldiers go through very painful experiences to save Private Ryan. During the process, the movie shows humanism and reality of the war. In the same way, The Thin Red Line tries to show humanism through the soldiers who are suffering from the cruelty of the war and the poor people with no guilt who become the victims. Also, the movie represents the time of war with reality very well. In those two movies, there are some horrible and cruel scenes, and they both deal with thedeaths of people. The focus of these movies is to make people think about war. People will say, &iexcl;How cruel the war is! That is so terrible. Thinks like wars must not happen again.&iexcl; In addition, both are quite serious but touching movies because even during the war, in those movies, people still know the dignity of human beings and people try to help others. The movies are both famous, and valued as great works. In these ways, Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line are both takinga serious view of war.	5.0	Comaparison with the other movie 'The Thin Red Line'	2003-06-10	1	1	0

Another great thing is that this story is seen throug the eyes of its leader(Tom Hanks, who plays Captain John Miller) and sometimes the men he leads.Overall acting: 5 stars: Tom Hanks does an excellent, but quiet job in portraying his role as Captain John Miller. Matt Damon, as Private James Ryan is just as convincing. Also, Jeremy Daives does an great job on expessing his characters emotions and thoughts.Overall plot: 5 stars: Captain John Miller must take his eight men on a journey through Normandy. They have a mission to carry out, thier mission is to find Private James Ryan, who's other three brothers were killed in combat. Because of this, Private Ryan has a free ticket home. Throughout thier journy, the eight men encounter many troubles, and every wrong decision is faced with horrible consequences.I would not reccomend this to someone with a weak-stomach.
