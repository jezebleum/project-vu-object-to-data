B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A202BO87Z7SLUR	&#34;D.&#34; Dark	When I first saw Serenity I had no idea it had been made after a cancelled TV series. Fortunately the movie stands completely on its own. Extremely well written, acted and directed, this was what I had been waiting to see for a long time in the realm of Sci-Fi.Needless to say I was immediately addicted and became a fan of the series too.Everyone who still wants to see how great moviemaking can be, should watch this at least once in their life. Or twice. Or every week...	5.0	Yes, Serenity is really that good	2007-08-18	1	0	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1	"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11"""	"I was 10 years late to the ""Firefly"" series...and then gorged myself on the delightful mix of science fiction and western memes, dark humor, subtle social commentary and comic=book violence of the 14 available episodes in a weekend.Question 1: Would this movie stand alone without being prefaced by the series ?Answer 1: Yes. But but treat yourself to the series first.Marginal spoiler alert:The family member who turned me on the series warned me about the movie: ""Don't watch it! Characters you like will die....""And while this is indeed true, carnage does not befall the entire crew, so the finality is not wholesale.This story focuses on the Alliance's interest in River's special skills, and the Alliances desperate ploy to cover up the truth about the origin of the Reavers. As the plot unwinds, you get to enjoy all of your favorite Serenity crew members doing what they do best. And the do this with fun doses of action and crisp, clever dialog.This is what you need to bring your ""Firefly"" experience to closure..."	5.0	Shiny. A worthy coda to the series...	2012-12-01	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A17JNWMQJ376R2	49sim67	The only problem with Serenity is that it came to an end. Sure be great if there was more to see in this series. Josh Whedon please consider continuing this series. It is too bad that Firefly/Serenity did not continue. With so much unimaginative garbage being produced out there, it is a shame that something with substance and continuity could not continue to draw support. Well done Josh Whedon here my vote for a sequel.	5.0	Great Film On Blue Ray	2013-06-05	1	1	0

It captured the essence of adventure so well and the chemistry between the cast was just perfect. This movie takes everything from the series and expands upon its awesomeness even more.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AIVW70D4EGQ87	"A. Austin ""artemishunter"""	Browncoats the world over got a nice little gift when Serenity's Collector's Edition hit stores. Fantastic new cover art and inventive presentation make this little beauty pretty before you even open the box! The DVD menu's a tad simple, just taken from the original release and removed the cast faces whizzing by. I still think there are a few deleted scenes that should have been included (Stuff on Miranda that everyone's seen in blooper footage), but the new commentary makes up for almost any faults I can find. Joss, Summer, Adam, Ron, and Nathan are fantastic as they go through the entire movie and reminisce 4 years back into their chance to keep flying.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AAKXNDAN3PHES	A. Benoit	This review contains spoilers.If you're a die-hard sci-fi fan that never watched Firefly, you might not like this movie. If you're a die-hard Firefly fan that's a purist about details, you might not like this movie.I read some of the 1-star reviews and I read some of the 5-star reviews. In both cases, I think people were a little too harsh on a movie that's very entertaining.For the Firefly fans, there were a few things that were inconsistent with the series, but in my opinion, they weren't major enough to detract from the entertainment value of the movie.The dialogue was just as quick-witted and sharp as it was on the series. The action and non-action scenes were balanced. I was not once bored during the film. While the deaths were heart-breaking and hard to bear, I understood why Joss wrote them in that way.I took both my mother and my girlfriend in to see this film in the theater. They both have rewatched it on DVD at least once, and now my girlfriend is watching the series because she liked the movie so much. I think if you go into this with an open mind, you will enjoy it for what it is--entertainment.Bonus Points on the DVD:-Hilarious outtakes-A good selection of deleted scenes.-Interesting featurettes.-An easter egg: the making of the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial along with the full-length commercial.	4.0	A Firefly fan with an open mind	2006-01-29	3	2	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A225IZORWVBL4H	"A. Bugden ""Auz"""	"The earth that was is gone, it was used up. You don't dwell because you don't have time. You have to make a living 'cause the alternative is short and mighty unpleasant. Simply, you deal.Imagine, a place where towns and cities are few and VERY far between.  Then imagine an equally far away government obsessive about order and less interested in helping it's people provide for themselves. Most people earn a hard living from the land, growing the food they need to live. Imagine the journey of seven souls who travel from town to town trying to make a living.  If you can get work, you take it. All of Serenity's crew have a past, but two have a past that rubbed the government the wrong way.But this ain't no chuck wagon, cause chuck wagons arn't worried about burning up ""goin atmo"" (atmospheric entry).Based on Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"", Serenity takes flight following nine souls who happened to cross each other's path in the 26 Century.  But Serenity is written so that you can just hop into the story without knowing the TV series.  With smart and not so smart dialog, the two-hour movie is a guilt free look into a harsh future where people do what they have to get by.  You may even recycle more after seeing it."	5.0	For pilots, Sci-fi buffs, and those who loved those Saturday Morning Westerns...	2005-11-05	7	6	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2O8RIDCJ0H83V	Acoma	"First off, I have watched the DVDs of the short-lived Firefly series three times. I have no basis for this film from the perspective of someone who is unfamiliar with the ""Firefly Universe"". Objectively speaking though, I believe even if you haven't seen the Firefly series you will still find this one of the best movies to come out in a long time.If you ever wondered what it would be like to watch a movie with comedy/horror/action/drama all rolled up into one succesfully then that is Serenity.There are a lot of characters in the film, but Mr. Whedon combined them all rather well. After the dismal showing of the Star Trek: Next Generation films which were basically suped up episodes I was skeptical about a TV series making a transition to film. This is not just another episode and it does take into account everything that happened in the TV series. It is a film with a great plot and excellent storytelling.The comedy is by far my favorite from this movie. I was laughing out loud quite a few times in the theatre. There are so many trash films that come out of late with suped up special effects or very boring storylines that watching Serenity was a real treat.If you haven't been to the movie theatre in awhile because of the lack of good films then give this one a try. You won't be disappointed because you will laugh, jump in your seat and might even shed a tear."	5.0	From Firefly to Serenity...	2005-10-06	4	3	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2LWW3S2ZE9FFD	"A. Cupps ""- I aim to misbehave"""	This movie was incredible and one of the best movies in recent years. Yes, it wasn't Star Wars or any other recent sci-fi films that have so much CGI or overwhelming graphics but a old fashion space western that reminded me of how Star Wars used to be - a good movie with a good plot.Unfortunatly, due to the lack of theaters and the fact that many people had to drive more then an hour to see it at the closest theater - it could not do as well as it could have had Universal pushed for more theaters. Another reminder of the first release of Star Wars in '77.Maybe its not for everyone but everyone I know except one person loves the movie and has seen it multiple times. The one person who saw it I think was expecting another Revenge of the Sith...This movie brings back the magic that was once there. Those that truly appreciate it do so for the fact that it is fun to watch, moving to listen to and gets the heart rate going no matter how many times you see it. You have your classic characters from mythology - the hero (River & Mal), the Warrior Princess (Zoe), the goofball (Wash), the anti-hero (The Operative), the Swashbuckler (Jayne) and so on. This is classic mythos in modern form once again. Maybe its predictable in some points but maybe thats because its a story we have been hearing all our lives in every great story ever heard, listened to or seen.	5.0	Lucas made space dirty, Whendon gave it guts...	2005-12-09	10	8	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ANOA08Q363G6X	"Adam Avitable ""It's Inevitable."""	"Since 1977, there has not been a sci-fi film that captured the magic, romance, humor, and adventure as well as Star Wars.  Serenity has turned that all around.Joss Whedon is a genius.  He ""gets"" life, and he ""gets"" the pathos required to make a character truly lovable.  This is a movie for intelligent, mature, movie lovers.  If you are one of those people who think XXX is a good flick, or think that Fight Club was really about fighting, OR, if you're someone who only watches those ""slice of life"" films (which are good in their own right), you won't understand this film and shouldn't bother.  But otherwise, go for it and buy several copies.  Support this type of creative and artistic direction."	5.0	This movie is the best scifi film since the original Star Wars	2006-01-09	12	12	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A34VV92TSLC37R	Adam Craig	"The only way I can think of to describe Serenity would be a ""laid back"" movie that was well aware of its core audience, and well aware of ways to exploit its own genre, in a positive way.The crew of the Serenity is being trailed by the Alliance due to the fact that they are harboring a psychic girl with unknown powers.  In what seemed like an anti-big government screed, the movie presents the Alliance as an all powerful, corrupted, invasive government that tries to control every aspect of the life in the new solar system.  River, the psychic girl, knows some secret that the Alliance has been keeping from its citizens; a secret that could cause the whole thing to come crashing down.  So the alliance sends its best assassin after the girl, and the whole crew of the Serenity.  The assassin, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is one of the best villains I have seen in a movie in quite a long time.  A lot of that is thanks to his acting, but also thanks to the writing of Joss Whedon.  The writing in this movie is amazing.  Whedon does an amazing job of giving each character their own distinct personality.  Each Serenity crew member adds something, and by the end of the movie, you are really rooting for the crew as a family.  The dialogue is interesting, not overdone, and extremely funny in some parts.The action is cool.  Yeah, there are some cheesy parts.  But you are rooting for the good guys so much, you just don't care how cheesy it is.  Near the end, I was almost standing up yelling at the TV for crew of the Serenity to fight their way out of the situation.  Technically, the movie is also very well-done.  The special effects are pretty dang cool.  The one real ""battle"" scene in the movie provides some amazing visuals, with the Serenity spinning out of control down through the atmosphere in the middle of a huge battle between the Alliance and the Reavers.Like I said, I never watched Firefly, but now I feel like it might be worth a shot.  In the least, I think that Joss Whedon is an amazingly talented up-and-coming filmmaker.  I can't wait for his next movie, I hope some studio will give him the opportunity to really create another vision of his like he did with this film."	4.0	From someone who's never seen Firefly, a really cool film	2006-02-02	9	8	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1DS0IESVWVVPF	Addison Phillips	"Ah, me. I'm not one of those folks who self-identify with little fandom groups with weird names--Trekkies and furries and whatnot. I liked FIREFLY: liked it a lot. Thought the world of it and really really really wanted more than the scant 14 episodes we got.I was in Moscow--the one in Russia--on a business trip with nothing to do (it gets cold in Moscow at night). I'm wandering the hotel and see the sign for the American Movie night. The poster is in Cyrillic and has some metal clad chick with an axe. Hey, wait... that Cyrillic says ""Serenity"".I was alone. I mean utterly alone in the makeshift theatre. With no one to tell about this film. It was... an epiphany. No, it isn't perfect. Boy does it have some warts (I didn't much buy the trip to the dead planet in the middle), but mostly this movie is alive, breaking rules and breaking a fan's heart. So much what, say, SITH was not. Joss Whedon does not tip is hat to the fans. Not at all. Neither does he ""reboot"" the series, starting over at the beginning. And you don't see things coming.I walked out a Browncoat with nobody to tell. It was (mostly) magic. A ticket to a science fiction world you've glimpsed maybe here and there. And here you are in it.The reviews (I scoured them) were downright weird: 4 star reviews that duck at the end and say ""well, you know if you like this kind of stuff"" (as if it must be washed off).What does FIREFLY/SERENITY have to do to get noticed (so that the money guys will give us another fix)? I don't know. As I write this, though, the DVD is #4 in sales on Amazon. Somewhere, someway, under the radar, a lot of folks are finding it. Singing the weird-as-get-out theme song.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1AXHNRDJEQ0B	Adi Adler	It seems that while Joss Whedon is a genius where it comes to writing TV series, it seems that his movies aren't always up to par. While it can be assumed that 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer - the move' was a flop since Joss didn't have much control of what was done to it, Serenity had no such excuse. Perhaps writing a plot which will fit a 90 to 120 minute feature film is much harder than writing one that will fit the 40 minutes or so of a weekly episode that can be extended throughout an entire season...Written to tie up the many loose ends of 'Firefly', my main disappointment with 'Serenity' was that it seemed too much like many other sci - fi X File style features. The plot itself was pretty perdictable (including the 'plot twist' at the end), and after a while I stopped wishing for something original to happen and just wanted the movie to end...	3.0	Firefly revisited	2009-02-21	6	2	4

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A25TLT7VWW9AY3	A. Fuller	I went to see it the day it came out not knowing what to expect. I hadn't seen any trailers or any commercials. I thought it was awesome. It won't win any awards or I don't expect it to. But it was enjoyable and I really cared about the characters... so much so that after the movie I barrowed the series from my friend and watched it all in the next 72 hours. There are some jokes that I get more know that I have seen the series. And it is better having seen the series, but the movie got me into the series. So it isn't just a film for fans. Just kick back, have no expectations and you will enjoy this movie. Also I found the trailers after I saw the movie...

Hopefully it will be resurrected by one of the cables.  And of course Serenity is a truly great movie that stands by itself even if you've never seen the series.  But it will make you want to see the series.Anyway, back to the Blu-Ray.  We had the normal DVD and it was good.  Before we saw the Blu-Ray we thought the regular DVD was great.  Now we know it was only good.  Not only is it a terrific action adventure movie but it is definitely one that you can use to fully show off your 1080p TV and your super surround sound system.  It is reference quality.  Grab it, turn the sound up, push play and enjoy!	5.0	A Favorite Gets Even Better!	2010-01-28	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"As I glance through other reviews of this film, I see several people mention that they had not seen the television series prior to watching this film.  While most still loved what Whedon had to offer in this big screen adaptation, I must warn everyone that you MUST watch the television series first.  There are character connections and emotional moments that you may not develop an understanding about without watching the series first.  Serenity is a conclusionary film in the sense that its purpose is to finally answer those questions that were left on the table at the end of the television series.  With that said, Serenity is the BEST conclusionary film ever!  The true conclusion to Whedon's science fiction epic is finally told with the budget it deserved.  While I do believe that Whedon could have successfully done this perhaps seven seasons later, due to the final termination of the first season, he did the best that he could.  Actually, who am I kidding, he did magnificently.I am an enormous, yet new, fan of this series.  For those that have not experienced the television show Firefly, you are missing out on possibly the best that television had to offer.  This film is just a brief snippet of what was offered in the television series.  So much of this film is left up to the idea that the viewer has seen the television series, no matter what others may say.  You need to watch the television series first.  Whedon has amazingly transformed the bond between these characters, the tension, the excitement, the passion, and given them their feature debut.  Everyone, from the small background characters to the head-honchos of this crew, give more than 100% in their efforts for Whedon's dream.  It is obvious as you watch this conclusion that those involved with this series were extremely passionate about what Whedon was creating.  The actors were completely immersed in their roles, giving us the same spunk, pizzazz, and charm from the original series.  Watching Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, and Summer Glau reprise their characters was like revisiting your favorite book on a beautiful spring day at the beach.  Nothing could have been more enjoyable or relaxing.One of the aspects that I love about this film is that Whedon honestly does answer all of those burning questions that are in the back of your mind.  Fans of the show will know what I am talking about.  Those watching the series and wondering about River, Reavers, the Alliance, and a bit about Book will know more coming out of this film.  Whedon does not disappoint his fans.  He does this by keeping so many of the same elements in the film that we grew to love in the television series.  The very technological CGI, the western atmosphere (though this film does feel a bit more sci-fi than the television series), and the bond between the crew (a element that you do not see in most television film adaptations) are all points that made the series great.  Whedon has taken these and crafted one of the best films this year.  Even three years after the final episode, Whedon remembers what brought his fans to this series.  He remembers the humanity of the characters, the humbleness of Mal, and the fire that is in each of their eyes.  It is about having faith (but not always about God), it is about honesty, and it is about courage and dedication.  After watching this film you cannot help but feeling motivated to get up and fight for what you believe in.  Mal and his crew ignite that passion within you!If I had to have two gripes about this film, they would be very small, yet still dwelling within my mind.  Where were the men in the blue gloves?  Remember, River always chanted, ""two by two""?  There was even an episode called ""Ariel"" nearly dedicated to them.  I wish Whedon had expanded with them instead of focusing so contently on this Operative.  While I think the Operative was amazing, I just kept thinking about them throughout the film.  The second remaining question that I had was this, ""Who was Shepard Book""?  I thought out of all of the characters, even River, he was the most complex.  While he is hardly in this film, he continues to force us to ponder on what is truly in his past.  What makes him different, yet special at the same time?  Just two simple questions that I did not feel validated by the end of the film.  Small gripes, nothing huge to talk about.Overall, this movie was fantastic.  It carries everything a sci-fi, western, action genre person would want.  Whedon proves that he has the power to control his characters and develop honest stories that keep simple themes and devoted morals.  Serenity was nothing short, to use words from my Firefly review, of perfection on a stick.  Never have I finished a series, coupled with a film, only to want to start from the beginning again to see my old ""friends"" in action.  I actually felt very emotional when this film was over because I really didn't want to have a final closing to this series.  I wanted to know that my friends would still be out there waiting to make me laugh, enjoy an adventure, and grow challenging secrets.  It is what I loved about the TV series, and it is what completed this film for me.Whedon, from Firefly to Serenity, I applaud you!!BRAVO JOSS, BRAVO!!Grade: ***** out of *****"	5.0	Half of writing history is hiding the truth.	2006-01-19	17	15	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A28QJTKQY0LS7P	"A. Havel ""angelsong76"""	"Remember the first time you rode a roller coaster? You can usually predict that first big drop, because of the build-up and that moment you sit, suspended in midair, looking down at the track stretching below you, but after that... you are at the mercy of the coaster.I am of the opinion that a good movie is like a roller coaster. There may be a predictable first drop, but the rest should be unexpected and thrilling, like a great Six Flags ride. Of course, it's even better when you can't even predict that first drop. And that's what Serenity delivers. Over and over until the very end.Set 500 years into the future, Serenity follows the story of Captain Malcolm (Mal) Reynolds, a veteran of the galactic civil war that happened between two factions of humans: The Alliance and The Independents. Capt. Reynolds was a member of the Browncoats, Independent Faction soldiers who were opposed to the Alliance in the Unification War. Capt. Reynolds, played beautifully by Nathan Fillion, owns a ship called Serenity, named after the location of the Independent's final defeat. For Reynolds, Serenity is freedom. The ship allows him to take jobs (both legal and illegal) and stay as far from the strong arm of the Alliance as he possibly can. His crew is made up of similar (and not so similar) minded peole who have their own reasons for being on Serenity. These crew members include Zoe (Gina Torres), who fought with Reynolds in the war, and who also happens to be married to the pilot, Wash. Wash, played by Alan Tudyk (28 Days, A Knight's Tale, Dodgeball, Into the West, and Spamalot on Broadway) is the perfect everyman character who is always ready with a well-timed quip. He also plays with plastic dinosaurs in his free time. Kaylee (Jewel Staite) is a young, spunky mechanic who wants to see the universe. She is everyone's friend and brings out a very brotherly protection instinct in Reynolds. Jayne is an assassain, played hilariously by Adam Baldwin (Independence Day, The Patriot, The Inside). Other crew members include a companion named Inara (Morena Baccarin) and a preacher named Book (Ron Glass). Together, this crew makes up a kind of family for Reynolds, and he is fiercely protective of this family.When Reynolds and his crew take on two passengers, everything changes. Simon (Sean Maher) and River (Summer Glau) are siblings with a secret that some would kill to keep and others would die to spread. Simon, a young and accomplished doctor, took River out of an Alliance facility, and they will stop at nothing to get her back.The crew of Serenity faces an immense challenge in keeping River and Simon safe from The Alliance, but they face other threats as well. In their travels, they come across the real-life incarnation of camp fire villains called Reavers, canabalistic savages who are said to have gone crazy at the edge of space. Caught between the murderous Reavers and the unrelenting Alliance, Reynolds is not having his best day ever.If the characters and premise sound a little familiar, you are probably one of the few who saw ""Firefly,"" the television show that ran on the FOX network in 2002. Created by award-winning writer/director Joss Whedon and hailed by critics, the show was cancelled after the network aired the second episode first and the first episode last, pre-empting episodes in between for sports coverage and other events, and keeping it in a traditionally difficult time slot on Friday nights. Fans of the show were unwilling to give up on it, though, and they rallied together on the Internet and made their voices heard. A DVD set of the series, including three unaired episodes, was released and spent months in the #1 position on online retailers such as Amazon.com. The active fan base decided the DVD wasn't enough, however, and began rallying for a movie to be made. Universal Pictures stepped up to the plate and greenlit the movie, and Whedon was able to get the entire original cast to return for the feature film. Whedon and the cast have even talked about making the film into a trilogy in the future, depending on how well the first film does. One important thing to note is that you do not have to know anything about the series before seeing the movie. An absolutely stunning opening sequence serves to refresh old viewers and to bring new viewers up to speed in a very elegant and interesting way. However, after seeing Serenity, you may want to purchase or rent the DVD set because you will want to know more about these characters.Serenity is a blend of all genres: action, sci-fi, adventure, western, comedy, romance, and foreign (the characters speak a little Chinese as part of the blend of Chinese and English-speaking cultures in this version of the future). Though the sci-fi and adventure elements are prominent, the most promient feature is the humor. Whedon is a master of witty dialogue and the intelligent quips that go back and forth between characters is delightful. Character is a focus in this film, and that, in addition to the big explosions and cool space battles, is what makes the film work as well as it does.Fillion owns the screen as Reynolds in a performance that rivals Harrison Ford's Han Solo. In fact, Serenity has been described as the story Star Wars would have been if it had been about Han instead of Luke. With better writing. And a more believable story. Summer Glau's River is psychotic and scared, vulnerable but extremely powerful. The origin of her abilities and the story behind the secret she carries will not disappoint even the most cynical moviegoer, and the outcome of the film cannot be predicted even by the most perceptive viewer.In the grand tradition of great Sci-Fi, Serenity has fantastic special effects, spectacular space battles, beautiful scenery and complex, satisfying plots. It will engage every emotion and keep you guessing until the last second, just like a good roller coaster does."	5.0	Best movie of the year!	2005-10-04	4	3	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A12NQ4FPP2CXDE	A. Horowitz	"If you're a Firefly fan, you have to see Serenity. If you're not a Firefly fan, you have to see Serenity.Serenity wraps up many of the mysteries left in Firefly, specifically dealing with River. While it doesn't answer all of the questions, and certainly brings up quite a few more, Serenity is the concluding story of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew, and depicts each member's growth as an individual.For those who have never seen Firefly, Serenity offers an action-filled sci-fi movie with an interesting concept. It's fast tempo easily draws watchers in, and will make them instant fans.  Many of my friends saw Serenity before Firefly, and are now die-hard Firefly fans.  I personally saw the TV show first, but either way I believe Serenity is an open movie for all to enjoy.Serenity is one of the many great works by Joss Whedon. It was the only movie directed by Joss before he was chosen to direct the Avengers, so clearly it impressed people.  It is ranked one of the 10 best Sci-Fi films of all time by SFX.  Orson Scott Card is reported to have said that he would not make an ""Ender's Game"" movie unless it was as good as Serenity.  Considering that movie has yet to be made, I'm going to assume that means the bar was set a little too high."	5.0	One of the Best Sci-Fi Movies	2012-05-23	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1AUOVXPT5MYX4	"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx"""	I didn't shed any tears when Firefly was canceled. I saw the first two or three episodes and then I gave up on it; the central mystery of the crazy girl was interesting but the individual episodes were slowly paced and bland. With the episodic structure gone, Serenity takes Firefly's central mystery and runs with it, creating a fast-paced, consistently entertaining sci-fi western.The movie is a lot of fun, with sharp dialog and pretty good acting (especially the assassin played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), but like Star Wars, there's really not much to it beyond surface flash. Which is okay, since I'm a sucker for good surface flash, but it does mean this cannot be called great science fiction; just very good action.While I enjoyed the movie a great deal, it does contain one of the central flaws of the series; the characters are a little bland, except for Gina Torres and the aforementioned Ejiofor. Nathan Fillion is a decent dashing hero, but he lacks the panache of a Harrison Ford or Errol Flyn. The crazy girl is an interesting concept but the actress doesn't have much to do except look fretful, and her brother is painfully bland. The other couple of women are likable but really don't have much to do. And the big tough guy, I almost forgot to even mention him.It seems Whedon's concept of a sci-fi western included using typical western stock characters, and I think that was a mistake. You can't have a good series full of two-dimensional heroes. But it actually works pretty good in a fast-paced action flick.	4.0	If the series had been this entertaining I would have kept watching	2007-08-10	6	0	6

As a movie that was made because of the uproar of fans, Joss Whedon did an amazing job pulling together all the elements of the tv show, trying to tie up some of the loose ends, and making a great run of it. Granted, by watching the series first, you're a little more drawn in by it, but even on it's own, it's an amazing movie.

I had no idea what this was, and no idea that this was a TV series made into a movie. How incredibly awful. The actors act like it's a TV show. The script reads like a TV show. And when it's all done, you feel like you were watching TV. Sorry, this is not what the crowd is cracking it up to be. If you consider good Sci-Fi to be movies like Blade Runner, Alien(s), Fifth Element, or Terminator, this movies not for you. If you're part of the new generation of ""Television is actually good"", then you can take it.I really wish they'd marked the box - I would've stayed away. I knew after the first 5 minutes that it was a full step below ""B"" movies, not even up to the level of Pitch Black or Chronicles of Riddick.TV Sci-Fi comes in at C- everytime. This is down there with Laser Hawk, and even worse than Star Ship Troopers II (and that was just awful).Shallow script, half-baked story, sketchy FX, and poor TV style directing."	2.0	Television Sci-Fi brought to the widescreen...

Now, I'm not sure why I liked the movie so much.  I don't know if it was because I really liked the series, or because the movie was indeed ""just good"" despite the short lived series.  Who knows.  I do know that the people I went to see the movie with, who had never watched the series, liked the movie as well.My only complaint is that it ""babied"" those who didn't watch the series or know anything about the series for too long.  If this had been the season premiere of Firefly, many things they showed you and talked about in this movie would have been editted out.  I was like, ""yeah, we know this already, let's move on"".  But being the fan I am of this series, I let it go and didn't let it ruin my experience.After the movie I asked, how was it that it blended science fiction, drama, romance and comedy so well together?  Very funny movie.  So good.  This is one of those movies you watch and don't feel like you wasted your money.  This time, the movie was actually better than the previews, an achievement in itself.P.S.Sure I wish for a Serenity 2, but I'm not certain it should be made.  This movie was made in such a way, I don't think it could be topped by another.  It's like when Michael Jorden retired, he should have stayed retired.  Joss Whedon may be very talented, but I think he should leave this series alone, for now.  I'll still like to read the books though.  I think this may be the last we see of anything Serenity for a long time on the screen, and that may be a good thing.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A98HTCO8EJPG8	Aleksey	"The introduction sequence from ""Serenity"" manages to cover so much background from ""Firefly"" in about five minutes - and yet, it doesn't seem forced. What we're witnessing here is a brush of a master at work.The rest of the movie doesn't disappoint, either. Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" is ""Firefly""'s bigger, rowdier brother. Created with a budget of $45 million dollars, instead of two spaceships, we get ... fifty. Instead of one planet, we get a few. Instead of one fighting sequence, we get several - wireless, grounded, physical, and much better choregraphed than fighting in Whedon's previous TV work.But what about the characters, you may ask ? Do we feel the same way about them as we did in the TV series ? Or have they been converted to mindless automatons, overshadowed by special effects on the green screens behind them ?Well, you can set your fears aside, friend. The characters from ""Firefly"" are fully intact - both with their flaws and the funny banter - some of which is surely to be missed the first time around. This is why you should buy the DVD !""Serenity"" appears to be the final chapter on the universe established in ""Firefly"". Somber as that thought may be, we can only wish the same sort of big-screen treatment for all of the other TV shows that we have grown to love."	5.0	A finishing throw for Firefly's punch-kick combo	2006-05-09	9	9	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3TLY1A7NGVCQM	"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP"""	"This movie exceeded every expectation I had.I got into the series after it was cancelled and I'm glad I did since I would have gone ballistic when the morons at FOX cancelled it. When I bought the DVD set I knew it was limited and therefor enjoyed it the more knowing it was as scarce as a rare jewel.Serenity as a film succeeds in the way that most space-operas fail: character development. In so many space opera characters are virtually interchangable and few have anything that really sets them apart. Serenity and Firefly revels in the characterizations and plays on the differences to make the whole better and stronger.I have read several professional reviews that opined that Serenity was better cast, written and performed than any of the last 3 Star Wars episodes. On this I heartily agree. Serenity makes the Star Wars look like as superficial as a Japanime cartoon in comparison.Dialog is fast and witty. Spec-effects are on par with the best of the best ( and probably done for a fraction of the cost of others) and Whedon's writing and directing make this a personal film with a strong libertarian streak throughout.The Firefly/Serenity universe is probably realistic for the time imagined -  +500 years. No aliens, no transporter beams, but  strong and pervasive internet ( the Cortex ), and above all practicality.You can see the future here and believe it.For those of you not familiar with the Firefly/Serenity universe, it may seem odd at first - old western. But logic it out. It makes sense. The Allinace terraforms ""dozens of planets and hundreds of moons"" populates them and leaves them to their own devices except when it's tax time. Most are forced into a agrarian economic base and a technology equivalent to the mid 1800's.Anyway way it doesn't matter all that much anyway because the plot doesn't depend on laser battles and weird aliens. It's about people and their yearning for freedom and our hope that 500 years is not enough time to stamp out the love of freedom no matter how powerful the Alliance or the Fed become and that individuals can triumph and live their own lives.Serenity is easily on par with the new Battlestar Galactica which according to Wired magazine is the ""best show on television"".Lets all hope that the success of this film will revive the series or at the very least lead to second movie."	5.0	Shiny	2005-10-04	8	7	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AVK3XUFZBQM1F	Alexis Selzler	"Serenity is a Science-Fiction film that takes place mostly in space. This movie is an exciting tale of a captain, his crew, and a young seemingly-crazy girl who make their living as thieves. The captain, Mal, has taken the girl and her brother onto his ship. The siblings, Simon and River, are on the run from the Alliance, the government of the galaxy. Simon broke River out of an Alliance laboratory, where they were doing studies on her, and they have been hiding since. Simon, thinking that Serenity is no longer a safe place to keep River, decides to part ways with Mal and his crew until River has a psychotic episode that exposes her whereabouts to the Alliance.Serenity started out a Science-Fiction television series called Firefly that didn't last very long. After the show was canceled it was decided there would be a movie to wrap up the loose ends of the story. Nathan Fillion plays Mal, the veteran captain trying to make a living after the end of the war. Summer Glau plays River. Adam Baldwin plays Jayne, a shoot-first-ask-later member of Mal's crew and a source for most of the humor in the film. These actors aren't exactly red carpet stars. However, they put together they made a great movie.This movie has everything. There is every type of romance, the budding love between the ship's mechanic and Simon, the mature love between Mal's first mate and the ship's pilot, and the estranged love of Mal and Inara, a teacher in a girl's house. The film is filled with action. There are numerous battle scenes with many enemies. The crew is forced to fight off Reavers, cannibals and rapists who float out in space and send raiding parties to nearby planets, during a heist. The Alliance sends an assassin, armed with a samurai sword, after River and Mal fights him more than once. There is also humor. This movie has many funny parts, mostly due to Jayne's snide comments such as the one made during the climactic battle scene. The first mate asks, ""Do you really think any of us will make it out of this alive?"" Jayne pauses for a moment as he looks at the rest of the crew, then replies, ""Well, I might.""There are truly, very few negatives to this film. Although the movie is a cheesy Sci-Fi flick the storyline is fantastic and intriguing. The actors are mostly unknowns, but they play their parts spectacularly. The special effects were even fairly well done for when the movie was made. There's very little I would change about this film, if anything at all.This is an excellent movie for Sci-Fi buffs, but not only them. I have never really been interested in Science-Fiction space movies but I enjoyed this movie immensely.  I recommend this movie for those who enjoy films like Star Wars and Star Trek. However, I also recommend Serenity for those who are looking for a movie that's a little out of the ordinary, but has a great storyline."	5.0	Sensational Sci-Fi Flick	2011-09-12	1	0	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A402IK8HX9SBN	"Alex Lovejoy ""Alex"""	Firefly, the series, is one of my all time favorite Sci-Fi / Future/Tech Fantasy TV shows.  I love the Wild West and Oriental cultural overtones ... I love the rough and tumble nature of the crew and their missions and lifestyle.  And I particularly loved the time and attention that was given to exploring and expressing the very different personalities of the crew members as their individual and collective stories were being unfolded. I just loved that series.  I watch the DVDs over and over.So, I was really very interested in what they were going to do with the Serenity movie.  Here's my take, now that I've seen it:A)  Were they true to the characters, themes and styles of the TV show?  YES, absolutely, though with a few twists.B)  Did they explore and expand on the themes and plot lines laid down in the series without doing so in a way that requires having seen the TV series to enjoy the movie?  YES.  Absolutely.C)  Was the mixture of action, suspense and quality gritty story telling up to the standard of the TV show.  Yes, absolutely.D)  Was the movie just like the series?  No.A series can take the time, week to week, to slowly and carefully unfold layers of it's characters and story lines that a movie simply can't.  The series brief 11 episodes had something like 450 minutes with which to carefully, slowly, gradually unfold these characters and story lines ... the movie had 119.  So I didn't expect the movie to have THE SAME feel as the show.  What I was hoping for was a look and feel that was consistent with the show while recognizing that a theatrical movie release has to have somewhat different goals from a TV series.  I think they did a great job of that.  And I really enjoyed the movie.I've seen some folks say that the movie lacked some of the personal intimacy of the TV show, and I think that's true.  Given the fact that it was a 2 hour movie and they had 9 characters to deal with in a balanced way, maintaining the same degree of intimacy while still presenting a movie that was compelling to the action/adventure crowd would have been amazingly difficult, if it's possible at all.  As someone who really loved that very personal feel the series had, I didn't think they gave up more of that in the movie than was absolutely necessary.  And if the gangbuster movie results win them a chance to give new birth to the TV show ... well, then they will have succeeded in achieving what I think was their and their fans dream of dreams.Were there any things I'd have done differently?  Yeah, but so what.  This show had a lot of very emotionally attached fans.  They can't do everything the way every fan would have preferred.  Did they do a great job that I felt totally able to enjoy?  Yes, you bet.  And the friend who went with me to the movie had only seen 2 of the 11 series episodes and he also enjoyed it ... and he's a pretty demanding Sci-Fi fan.	4.0	VERY enjoyable, yet different from the series.	2005-10-09	5	4	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3Q10ZPZMLXBQP	All Seeing Eye	"From all the trailers and hype surrounding it, one would think that Serenity would surpass all expectations. Well, it didn't. It has got to be one of the most cliche`d science fiction movies I have ever seen. If you are reading this -- and are a highly charged fan-- please consider that as a neutral observer my comments are not meant to offend. I am simply pointing out truth without bias in or against the film.To give the film credit, the special effects were stunning. I loved the introduction to the worlds, and the beautiful alien landscape designs. (Although one of the buildings looks suspiciously like the Dubai Emirates Office Tower of the U.A.E)However the alien landscapes after that are fairly ""star warsy"" and nothing really original stands out. The soundtrack was absolutely brilliant also, and was one of the few things that was quite perfect. Some of the ideas highlighted in the movie also had merit; I particularly like the idea that China and America had merged to become the world's greatest superpower. I also liked how Chinese and English were merged in the film. But that is where the praise must end.The story begins with River Tam who has just escaped an Alliance facility with her brother, Simon. Apparently this girl is a dangerous weapon and a psychic, and so the Alliance must get her back at all costs. This escape scene was far too fake and easy really. It was over before it started. And no one seems to notice that River Tam is the 17 year old incarnation of Haley Joel Osmont from the Sixth Sense. The wide eyes, occasional raspy word and mental breakdown are the only glimpse we ever get of her real character. The fighting scenes weren't bad, but they weren't great either. They could definitely take pointers from another cancelled show like Mutant X -- one that had far more flair, orginality and character development.After the two renegades are picked up by the Serenity, we meet the cast, and it isn't very pretty. Captain Mal seems to be a carbon copy -- pun intended-- of Han Solo right down to the scruffy hair and wisecracking drawl. He even dresses like him, which is quite unsettling because one gets the feeling that one is watching a bad Star Wars remake. I find it laughable that people actually find Serenity better than the prequel Star Wars films, which were not perfect by any means, but easily beat Serenity.( In the bonus features Josh Whedon even admits that he was heavily influenced by Star Wars. Sounds like a confession to me.)The characters of Jayne and Zoe are blase`. Jayne is the stereotypical tough guy while Zoe is the token black character that must accompany the all white cast. I can see that the actors are trying to make do with the script they received, but it isn't working. There are brief refences to ""the war"" now and then. After a Star Wars like chase through the hills, the soldiers turned thieves, make it back to the ship after Mal shoots a man who wanted to come with them. Zoe  later confronts Mal stating that they never would have left a man stranded in the old days. This scene could have been far more poignant, but Mal's blank stare leaves much to be desired.After the introductions have commenced, confusion ensues. Apparently they want to kick off River and Simon. There's supposed to be some conflict here but the others don't seem to have much of a problem kicking them off -with the exception of Kaylee. Simon and River head on their way when River loses control in a bar and kills a few dozen people. Once again the fighting isn't all that great. River Tam looks like a skeleton with eye bags. The beautiful, curvy woman on the front of the Serenity cover was truly put their to be eye candy, because River's eyes never become blue. And she doesn't look anything like she does in the movie.Back to River, subliminal messages are planted in an ""Oaty Bar commercial"" where cute  Chinese style cartoons suddenly ""burst out of their blouses"" due to eating an oaty bar. Disturbing to stay the least. Apparently they were planted with sublimnial messages by the Alliance, who hope to track River down by making her lose control. Mal then takes River back to the Serenity and no one except Kaylee is really happy to see them. (And she is probably more happy to get into Simon's manly arms, as they later tumble passionately as the move nears the end)River then has more of her crazed fits and mutters 'Miranda' over and over. They then go to the planet and discover the""terrible secret"". For the sake of the reader I won't spoil the ending, but this  does not explain why River is a deranged maniac. (I know she was experimented on but the viewer was lead to believe that River Tam's outbursts were related to the secret.) River then eerily metamorphoses into the tiny, black haired girl from the Ring. Fighting ensues as the crew decides to reveal the secret to the known worlds so that the Alliance's power is weakened.More fighting ensues as the assasin sent to trail them, the only interesting character in the film, arrives. There is even more fighting and at the end of the scene River Tam has suddenly become Mila Jovovich from Resident Evil. The pose seems xeroxed right out of the movie which is really strange. (The 'secret' too seems 'inspired' from this same movie in case you were wondering) Inara , the courtesan, is confined to the looking-pretty-staying-behind-the-brave-hero-role. Similar to mary Jane fromt the first Spider man movie.Overall, I had to fight to keep my eyes open. And yet I continued to watch, waiting to find out the secret. Perhaps I thought it would redeem the whole movie, but I was to be sorely disappointed. No offence to Firefly fans, but if the T.V show was anything like the movie I can see why it was cancelled.This movie is really all hype, and the only reason it was made because Josh Whedon is the creator of Buffy and Angel. With his name behind the movie the people at Universal could guarantee to tap into his legions of fans. In a few years time everyone will remember Star Wars and Lord of The Rings. But no one will remember Serenity."	1.0	Absolutely , mind bogglingly droll	2006-06-09	198	34	164

My libertarian friend from MLP, J.L., raved about it, but to me it's total crap. The most boring story ever, I totally tuned it out about 20 minutes into the film. The aesthetic and artistic value is just about nil. It seems like a pulp action movie suited to country hicks in the schticks, or mentally-challenged farm hands. I can understand liking it if you're high on a few beers or a joint and you would find almost anything entertaining, but really, being fully sober I couldn't find anything to like about this. Even the story is somewhat muddled, something about a female action hero who is always ready to bang some heads together to save the day. I mean, please, there are better action movies! How about ""Starship Troopers"", for instance? This is 3rd rate sci-fi. I've had very bad luck with all the movies my libertarian friends have recommended to me. Movies like ""Fight Club"", and this. Total losers. Well, I've concluded that if you want to understand the truth about politics, listen to a libertarian; if you want guidance about elite movies or any other High Art, it's better to seek advice from ""the establishment""."	1.0	a TOTAL DISASTER for any Cinemaphile or Connoisseur	2007-01-04	107	5	102

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A52X1I4UT56KL	"Amazon Customer ""debater7"""	Serenity gives Firefly fans what we all want (besides more Firefly): closure.  Director Whedon does a brilliant job of tying up loose ends by explaining the central mystery of Firefly and even developing the characters more.  He also leaves room for a continuation of the series, by advancing key relationships to points that would allow a new storyline, including making room for new characters.  I can't be more specific w/o including spoilers, but really, this movie's great strength is the amount of material it covers.  The Firefly saga gets wrapped up neatly and satisfyingly and Serenity works well as a a stand-alone because of the very fast pace required to explain what could have been the basis of an entire second season.As other reviewers point out, this is also the movie's only weakness.  Certain parts do seem rushed.  However, what is lost is not terribly significant.  For example, not much time is spent on Jayne, but, hey, Firefly had a whole episode focused on Jayne and his character isn't supposed to be terribly complex.  Meanwhile, Kaylee and Simon both get a lot of attention and River reaches a point where she could be more than merely mysterious and disfunctional.  We also get an explanation of the Reavers.Technically, Serenity is solid.  Good special effects, good dialog, good acting.  For non-Firefly fans, this is the best sci-fi movie to come out in a long while.  It moves faster, is funnier, has more realistic characters, and more interesting relationships than the Star Wars prequels. (I apologize in advance to the George Lucas fans out there). If you like sci-fi, Serenity will be pure joy.  If you like Westerns, it'll be good.  If you don't, this may be the one recent movie that can change your mind.Gongrats to the whole Firefly team.  Serenity could hardly be a better way to finish.	5.0	Closure.	2006-01-27	8	7	1

It's a Science fiction film where plot and characterisation have not been submerged by pointless CGI and the need to merchandise a myriad nasty plastic toys. Devoid of bug eyed monsters and pseudo mystic waffle, this is a story about believable people in a futuristic setting, even non Sci Fi buffs can enjoy it.

However cancelled it was and rarely was a bigger gaff made by the studios. The film Serenity finishes off the story beautifully and left it open for another series to pick up where it leaves off, although that seems unlikely now. The film is well made and each of the cast provides an excellent performance.

I just don't know that there has ever been or will be a show and movie like this again. I lament its conclusion and wish there was a way we could see what happened to the crew of Serenity.

So I bought the series, and then the movie Serenity, (from Amazon of course) and watched it on my laptop.To say that I was blown away would be an understatement! I must be careful here, because I have seen other films and TV series that I thought far surpassed anything I'd ever seen before (Mash, X Files, Lonesome Dove, and others come to mind) and it's hard to drop one of those from my list of permanent favorites, but I came close to replacing them all with Serenity and Firefly. The writing was powerful, the casting superb, and I was caught up in the sheer passion that Joss and his crew obviously felt for this calling.So no, it did NOT ""replace"" all my other favorites, it forged a new category in my mind, that embraced all of the others into one ""Holy Grail"" from which I refresh myself from time to time.I'll be watching it again soon, and I do not think I'll be changing my mind about it at all!"	5.0	Joss Whedon is a genius!	2012-10-16	0	0	0

As soon as the bar scene with River came on, it clicked into place - I wasn't supposed to see this movie, it looked *horrible* in the previews.  Thank goodness a friend of mine lent me the Firefly DVDs, I was excited and didn't even remember the horrible previews (who made them?!  Not the director, I would have to imagine).  It's really too bad that the little marketing there was for this movie, it was downright unrepresentative.  This western (that happens to be set in space) has everything going for it - *fantastic* actors, *amazing* writers, and complimentary (and not distracting) special effects.There had to have been some conspiracy to keep this movie down because it was perfect.	5.0	Special effects + character-driven plot...	2005-11-29	18	17	1

(Although if you have, it probably makes more sense as you're able to reconnect with the characters much quicker).The story is inventive, interesting, and captivating. It also answers a few unanswered mysteries from the TV show, so if you were a fan of firefly, you'll want to watch the movie for that aspect at the very least."	5.0	better than the TV show	2006-12-26	3	3	0

The whole Western/Sci-fi theme, while fairly unique, just didn't work for me.  And the little skinny girl going ballistic on Reavers was completely ridiculous, not to mention Reavers being able to pilot sophisticated starships when they're supposed to be some kind of irrational madmen!This was just a silly TV movie somehow - SOMEHOW - elevated to feature film status.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A148WY6W8G2RIS	Amazon Customer	Well as soon as I had heard that there was a movie coming out for the shortlived Firefly series I counted down the days.  My friends were patient with me as I probably drove them insane... 1 year to go...1 month to go...1 week to go...and when it finally came to New Zealand (well after it had opened everywhere else) their suffering was alleviated.I watched and noticed a few differences from the series but hey no biggie.  Maybe it was just the movie theater but some of the dialogue was a little muffled - I'll find out with the DVD - but the visualisations were great - the ship and environments in the Wedon universe were done justice with a bigger budget.My only regret is that it was just a movie and I hope that the series will be picked up again or there will be another movie.  I can dream can't I...but until then I will have to content myself with the series and this DVD.To those that have watched and liked the movie but haven't seen the series - buy it, you won't be disappointed.

What a shame that the people at Fox are so focused on immediate payback that they did not allow this show to cultivate an audience (can you spell Seinfeld Fox???). This show and movie are really that good.It is not necessary to watch the series before the movie, but guaranteed, you will watch the movie again after with a whole different perspective and enjoy it all that much more.As for the (very few) negatives here, all I can say is.. they just didn't get it.	5.0	Please say it isn't over..	2006-03-24	9	9	0

It flows perfectly, follows continuity, and keeps a great balance between action, humor, and drama. If there is any flaw, it's that some people who did not read the ""Serenity"" 3-issue Dark Horse comics did not know certain things. The comic book trilogy bridges some of the events from the t.v. show to the movie, such as what happened to the blue-hand men, Shepherd Book, and such.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2F7KIN0SL00I6	"Amazon Customer ""Proverb"""	When I first heard that Joss Whedon was making a movie based on the Firefly series, I was so excited, but began to wonder how he would make it.  I was concerned about several things:1.  Would people who didn't watch the series be able to follow along with the movie?2.  How was he going to make a two hour movie over a twenty episode series with hours of character development?3.  If the movie busted, would it kill future Joss Whedon projects?All of my concerns were met with outstanding answers:1.  The movie was done in a way that you could watch it without having seen the show (Although the show's character development does help).2.  Joss decided to pick a few specific character's stories and go with them in the movie (And the beautiful thing is, he left it open for sequels to go into the other characters' stories).3.  It didn't bust and Joss is already scheduled to write and direct two more movies in the next two years (Including the highly anticipated Wonder Woman)The movie is great.  It has the perfect combination of Whedon humor, action, story, drama, thrills, and character development.  It is a roller coaster ride that doesn't disappoint and I can't wait until the December release of the DVD, which with any luck will have all sorts of goodies on it.I hope and hope that the success of Serenity will also spawn one of two things; Either many sequels or a television network to pick up the the Firefly series and continue the saga that was so horribly murdered.	5.0	Outstanding Film and DVD should be too!!!	2005-11-01	10	8	2

Being a movie, it loses a little of the feel of the series, but stands alone very well.Be prepared for shocks and surprises, more so if you're a fan of the series, and be prepared for a quirky ""not your usual run of the mill sci-fi"" feel if you've not come across Firefly before.The budget, while not as high as you might think, was used with exceptional effect, with the special effects putting some of the huge-budget blockbusters to shame.I'm sure it's been said before, but you do NOT need to have seen the Firefly series to enjoy this film.

You get the characters, their personalities, backstory, everything is seemless. He doesn't knock you over the head with it. This may look like a purely action movie but it isn't. It's hillarious, heartbreaking, intense, and one hell of a ride. You care for the characters. This is a character driven movie as much as it is anything else. You'll laugh and cry. I usualy look at my watch every now and then when I'm watching a movie, but not with this one. It keeps you hooked untill it's over.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AV5XGM9DY6E56	"Amazon Customer ""steved2112"""	"I am a fan of Sci Fi, and was motivated to go see this by a glowing review by Orson Scott Card (author of Sci Fi classic Ender's Game). I intend to see this at least one more time in the theater, and will no doubt buy the DVD. I am further compelled to buy the Firefly series on DVD, since I was instantly impressed with the interaction of all these very strong carachters.The most important thing to me in Sci Fi is to make me feel I am glimpsing a plausible future universe, and this movie succeeds in presenting a people who are immersed in futuristic setting that isn't phony-seeming. The actors use technology and dialogue that describes an unknowable background of having always been aware of thier world, as we are of ours. But the producers don't make the mistake of having a ten minute conversation over every contraption they interact with. For example, they refer to a camera as a capture. I can relate to that. I would be clucking my tongue if the writers had instead opted to call it a ""multimedia 3D imaging module"". Sadly much of what passes for Sci Fi serves to stroke the ego of the prop designer with such nonsense.It was a terrific and moving production, and I can attest that this opinion is not relegated only to die-hard fans of the TV series. I rarely watch broadcast TV, so the series was unknown to me prior to the buzz surrounding this excellent film.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A928WN8NV03WZ	"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy"""	This is a mixed bag from the maker of the popular Angel and Buffy series. As well as the short lived Firefly series that this was based off of.  The series I never got into.  Didn't hate it, just wasn't my type of show though I am a big fan of his other creations.As a movie Firefly is ok.  It is fun, lighthearted, not overly violent or strange so it is kid friendly, and Whedon's wit still shines here and there.The problems are that there are a lot of flaws in the writing and the directions that were odd for Whedon to make.The concept is nothing new.  There was a b movie in the early 90's called Oblivon that won a few indie film awards that was the same concept, sci fi western and parody.  Wild west themes also played heavily into the original Star Wars series.Whedon is well renowned in Buffy and Angel for making interesting bad guys, or big bads; the Mayor, Wolfram and Hart, Spike and Drusilla, Adam.  This group however is rarely seen aside from their ninja superagent.  The other problem is that they are pretty much Britain in everything but name.  Which is a long running cliche in American movies. In an interview Kenneth Branagh commented on how America needs to let it go and stop making British villians.  If more focus had been made on it I would have accepted it as a joke.  He made similar references to good guys in Buffy, calling them white hats.  But here they are just vague references to a parliment and well refined British speaking bad guys that are an afront to the goodly salt of the earth heroes.The action sequences were a dissappointment.  They were often filmed too close to see what was going on. Strange flaw for the maker of Buffy.  Mostly what you see is random images of peoples facesThere was also the problem that this film offered little for those who haven't seen the show.  I reall just didn't care about the characters and for the life of me can't remember anything specific about any of them save the captain and young girl.this movie I give four stars for my dedication to whedon and appreciation for what he has done.  but I wouldn't advise it to anyone that wasn't a fan of his or who hadn't seen the show.  Because that is pretty much what this is, a long episode of the show.  if you like that, this will be your holy grail, if not, it just passes time.	2.0	for the fanboys, not the casual viewers	2006-01-25	20	7	13

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3B00QM1PP39C	Andres Mars	I really expected this to be one of the big film hits of the year. It was critically acclaimed at its release but failed to generate the box office that I anticipated.  Part of it, I'm sure, was the marketing campaign by the studio. However, upon reflection, I've come to realize that it is hard to boil this down to a simple concept that you can push.  It's a little too complicated for that.  I hope that, like the series, it will be discovered by many more on DVD.  If not, perhaps it will be picked up by someone like the Sci-Fi Channel.  It would make a great companion piece to Battlestar Galactica. There are many  more stories to be told in this universe.By the way, looking at the deleted scenes and the outtakes, there is great extended edition of this film contained within.  I would like some of these scenes reinserted into the film.  This one is something special.	5.0	Still Not Fully Appreciated	2005-12-20	14	13	1

Still, this movie is one of those genre-bending, fast-paced quirky films that appeal to many types of people on many types of levels.With top-notch special effects, the sci-fi buffs get a good taste of a possible future--not the traditional Star Wars/Star Trek ultra-hi-tech, all-is-good world.  It's 500 years in the future, and yes, there are still no aliens!  Get over it.Western fans can really appreciate the witty banter, gun-slingin' action, and quite impressive fight choreography.There's enough romance to entertain the ladies; the characters are fresh, exciting, flawed and dedicated.  The actors are top-notch, if not well known, and bring a fresh look into a new world.The network might have made a mistake in canceling the show, but you don't have to make a mistake by missing this movie.  Check it out.	4.0	Definitely worth the price of admission!	2006-01-29	8	6	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2YPC9AB2E8RE4	Andrew Kent	I saw this movie when it first came out on DVD, and watched it again just this past (hot) weekend, and it was very good both times. The characters are a nice mix of genre stock and unique individuals, but because the genres are mixed (western and sci-fi), the stock aspects are interesting in themselves, so the individual touches add even more depth. The opening single-shot scene is amazing, actually, and the action never lets up. It's a taut, tense, interesting movie, with a complex stories that flows because the script and director don't pander.	5.0	Seeing it in 2005 and 2013, and it's still very good	2013-07-08	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A11LBR6P1FIZEE	"Andrew Kulick ""bibi"""	"But, this film was very well done.If you've never seen ""Firefly"" (which was the case for me), the movie catches you up to speed fairly well in the first few minutes. There are things that I felt like I missed because I didn't watch the show, but Whedon goes out of his way to make sure that everyone will enjoy this movie.And enjoyed it and there are some good scenes, and I am not usually a sci-fi fan (with the exception of the outstanding, ""Fifth Element,"" which is like this movie in that it's not all about the action or the genre, but there are actual human elements to the characters and a good dose of humor sprinkled into the mix).The story itself is message oriented, without feeling like you're being beaten over the head for it, and as already stated, the humorous moments were a bit wrecked since most of them are shown in the trailer of the movie.The acting is well, for the film. Because the entire case of the television show is brought back for the movie, they've developed a great rapport and a style that shows they genuinely care about each other as actors and characters. This leads to all kind of great moments in which the characters interact almost as family, which is the whole point of the story, that this family is on the run and will do anything for each other. There are a few things in the film that are a bit confusing, not so confusing that you won't understand the story but you might just have to re-think it twice. I was expecting to see a little bit more buttkicking from the girl, River instead she just fights in two moments of the movie. The plot very oddly, was very similar to Resident Evil: Apocalypse which was also a great film. The only bad thing about this film, is the plot was a bit too stretched and it took a small tad of time to realize what they were doing. Overall This movie deserves a 4/5 and was very nice. I actually bought it. If you did like this film I highly recommend: Resident Evil: Apocalypse"	4.0	Not a huge fan of sci-fi films but...	2006-01-04	9	8	1

Parrish ""Arrrrgh"""	"Okay, there are other reviews to tell you just how strong this movie is and how cool the DVD eventually will be, so I'm gonna use this space to gripe about that cover art. Wow does it look like ass. Wow. It looks as if they pulled a guy off the street, gave him a 30 minute crash course in Photoshop, blindfolded him, let him try and design the cover, took a dump on the results, then packaged it.What's really infuriating is how the cover smacks of what went wrong with the marketing of this movie. I gaurantee there were at least 15 people with their fingers in this pie, saying things like ""Put a little space battle going on up there in the corner."" or ""Generic qoute at the top will sell DVD's!"" Cripes. Criiipes. Serenity wasn't that kind of movie. It was above all that.I really can't believe how bad that thing looks. It's sub standard even for typical sci-fi bad montage cover art. Covers like this, and especially the corporate greed mentallity behind it, cheapen film as an art form. Get an artist to design the cover art, not twenty suits and a copy of Photoshop.I do have to point out how much I loved the movie, though. It put a rather nice cap on the TV series, while still allowing space for possible future endeavors. Hopefully this cover will change by the time it's released."	5.0	Great movie, but the cover art...	2005-11-09	18	10	8
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	Serenity is one of the best movies that I have seen this year. Considering I got it off the clearance rack at Blockbuster, this is one of the best purchases I have made recently.  Why? Well...1) As a huge fan of the Firefly series, I enjoyed immensely the relevance to the plot line and inclusion of main characters.2) Okay, I admit it... River (played superbly by young actress Summer Glau) is extremely good-looking and a great actress.  Plus, the fact that she kicked major undead ass trying to defend Simon and the rest of the crew (using her amazing karate skills and a sword and a handax stolen from a dead undead) scores a billion cool points in my book.3) Two words: SPECIAL EFFECTS!!  Even though Firefly's SE was great, Serenity's CGIs blow all competition out of the water.4) The film is directed by Joss Whedon, the producer of two of the best series ever, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.  Whedon did an excellent job on the two series, but outdoes himself a million times over writing and directing Serenity.5) The plot rocks.  What else can I say?6) The Reavers (cannibalistic bounty hunters) were cool, but I loved seeing the crew kick their asses the one time they meet face to face.All in all, Serenity has something for everyone... It has romance, action, and some funny parts.  If I could give it more than five stars, rest assured I would.  This film is Joss Whedon's crowning work; let's just hope that his next piece even comes close (if possible) to the masterpiece that is... Serenity.	5.0	contains nearly everything RIGHT with sci-fi	2006-01-17	8	4	4
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"I still can't believe this movie was even made.  After all, Serenity is the follow-up to a failed TV show from 2002 that lasted only 11 episodes on FOX.  Sure the DVD sales for the complete series of Firefly have been amazing, but that is no indicator of how a movie will do.  Yet, Universal Pictures took a chance and bought the movie rights from FOX.  Reassembling the original cast and creator, they made the hopes and dreams of Browncoats (Firefly fans) everywhere.  The series left many questions unanswered (supposedly, creator Joss Whedon planned out seven years of storylines for the show), and fans saw this movie as not only a way to get answers for their questions, but it was a way to revisit the Firefly universe and its beloved characters.  You see, it's not just the stories that made Firefly a great show, it was also the amazing cast.  People genuinely cared for the characters, and being able to see them again was, as I said, a dream come true.Six months after the series finale of Firefly, things have only gotten worse on the firefly-class transport ship Serenity.  Due to the overbearing government, known as the Alliance, work is becoming harder and harder to come by for petty thieves like Capt. Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew.  This is causing the ship to fall into further disrepair, despite the best efforts of their gifted mechanic, Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite), and makes flying the ship more and more difficult for skilled pilot Hoban ""Wash"" Washburn (Alan Tudyk).  Meanwhile, former crew members Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), a registered companion (read: prostitute), and Sheperd Deria Book (Ron Glass) have left the ship for reasons that, while differnt, both involve Mal.  Furthermore, fugitive siblings Simon (Sean Maher) and River Tam (Summer Glau) are still wanted by the Alliance, and the government is getting desperate.  They have recently enlisted one of their nameless, rankless officers, known only as The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to bring in River Tam.  The Operative is simultaneously a ruthless killing machine, skilled in all types of combat and strategy, and an articulate orator who deeply believes in the possibility of a world without sin.While The Operative hunts down Serenity, Mal has decided to take River along with himself, Zoe Warren (Gina Torres), his first mate and wife to Wash, and Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) on their missions/jobs due to her ability to psychically read the thoughts of others.  Simon disapproves of this, fearing that she will somehow get hurt or caught.  Despite a good performance by River, Simon becomes enraged after the crew narrowly escapes an attack by Reavers (cannibalistic madmen) while on the mission, and decides that he and River are going to leave the ship and find a new transport.  Of course, things don't always go as planned on Serenity, and when the crew discovers one of River's latent abilities, they are forced to keep her onboard.Everything about this movie, in my opinion, goes well above and beyond any expectations I may have had prior to seeing it.  As usual, Joss Whedon delivers his trademark witty dialogue and (more importantly) an amazing plot.  A good amount of our questions from the series are not only answered, but answered superbly.  I never would have guessed at what really happened, and yet it makes sense and is truly a revelation.  Other questions were left unanswered, to be addressed in later movies (which unfortunately, as of right, now doesn't look like a possibility).  And while the level of character development isn't as good as it was in the series, this is a two-hour movie; there is only so much time to devote to each aspect (such as plot, action, and development).  Whedon has said that the film is pretty much season 2 of the series crammed into two hours.  He had to take out a lot of character stuff (such as a relationship between Mal and Inara) in order to tell us River's story.Furthermore, the actors all do phenominal jobs.  No one in the movie is on Hollywood's A-list, but I almost prefer it that way.  The original cast obviously have great chemistry together, and it is clear that they are all happy to be back.  Meanwhile, newcomers like Ejiofor and David Krumholtz give very solid performances as well (although Krumholtz's Mr. Universe is a bit of a silly character).For a film that was only made for about $40 million, the special effects look great.  With few exceptions (such as few shots in the chase scene near the beginning), the effects look seamless.  The ending battle is one of my favorite space battles in movie history, and yes, I have seen the original Star Wars trilogy.All in all, this is an amazing film.  I can't understand how it didn't take off.  It was supposed to be a sleeper hit, with word-of-mouth as its primary proponent.  For some reason, despite rave reviews from both mainstream and non-mainstream critics in addition to support from both old and new fans, the general movie-going public was very apathetic towards Serenity.  Sadly, a lot of people missed out on one of the year's best films.  Hopefully, the DVD* will win over all those people who didn't want to pay $10 for a ticket (so worth it).  Find Serenity, for there is no place that you can be once you find it.  They'll never take the skies from us.*Speaking of DVDs, I'm really afraid that Universal is going to release a multi-disc super special edition sometime down the line.  While I'd love one, I'd prefer for them to release it now."	5.0	Find Serenity in The Year's Best Film	2005-11-05	15	12	3

Even for the non-Browncoats out there, this is a special edition worth stuffing in the birthday or holiday gift bag.

(And a spoiler warning)I loved that Serenity and crew were flying again! ""Serenity"" picks up the story at a point where the crew is embarking on almost a crucible of a sort; no one's coming out the same. Some may not come out at all.  While darker than the series, ""Serenity"" still retained most of what I loved about ""Firefly"".  The cast, characters, the story and the style were as welcome as old friends.  Heists, Reavers, government assassins and conspiracies, and the ""truth about River"" (alas, it appears we will never know the tantalizing truth about another mysterious character); my husband and I enjoyed it immensely.  For an hour and a half, all was right in my `verse.During this rather dark chapter, I missed the humor that was more prevalent in the series.  The length of the film prohibited the quieter kind of individual moments between characters that I found appealing and gave them clich&eacute;-killing depths (Before live-in-the-moment-mercenary  Jane's conversation with Book in the Firefly episode, ""The Message"", who would have pictured him giving much thought to his life, death, or God. Or giving much thought to anything really!).  But this movie deals with hard times on Serenity.  As with many of my favorite shows, books, or movies, at the end I had the feeling that the story could not have been done better any other way.  ""Whedon and Co."" are Storytellers; they have stories to tell and they know how to do it.  A smart network or studio would just get out of their way and let them do what they do.(Warning Mini-Spoiler coming)  Before the movie's release, I dreaded the rumored loss of any of the main characters.  I've always found it difficult to choose a ""favorite"" character; they all appealed at different times for different reasons (a rare hallmark of good writing and acting).  Dramatically speaking, it did raise tension; literally no one was safe.  (Still, something in me insists that it sucks.)  But all is (almost.... mostly...) forgiven. I'll miss those irreplaceable characters and what they added to the mix (One has always reminded me of someone very special in my real life).

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1340GL04SILGC	Anniina Jokinen	"Basically, ""Firefly"" was a sci-fi television show about a ragtag crew of misfits in a junky spaceship at the far edges of civilized space 500 years from now. A fascinating mixture of space, cowboy, pirate movie, comedy, and drama, with brilliant writing and enjoyable actors, it's sort of like the story of what Han Solo might have been before Star Wars.  Or what the last several Star Treks should have been like, except they didn't have the luminous Josh Whedon as creator. It doesn't hurt that the captain and crew are on not-so-friendly terms with the Alliance of Planets that wants all of the 'verse to conform to norm.... Those of us who are on the side of the underdog and the dissenter can appreciate that.""Firefly"", the show, was cancelled after one season, but its loyal fans, who call themselves 'Browncoats' (after the Independents who fought against the Alliance) kept the hope alive. They believed, as the captain of Serenity, Malcolm Reynolds, that the Independents' side ""maybe have been the losing one -- I'm still not convinced it was the wrong one.""  Joss Whedon fought tooth and nail and finally got ""Serenity"", the movie, made.  It just proves what 'Captain Universe' in ""Serenity"", the movie, says: ""They can't stop the signal, Mal. They can never stop the signal.""I had not seen the TV show when I first saw the movie. While I didn't catch all of the inside jokes, I was rapt, immediately. The plot is engaging, the characters fascinating, the visuals and the world ruggedly beautiful. Whedon and his cast were able to make me feel invested in the movie from the first few minutes on, and I never felt let down - a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience!  I've since seen the show and the movie several times, and have joined the ranks of the Browncoats. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or the TV show, you are missing out.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AFCOI4UKT7PCJ	Anthony Graham	When the Firefly TV series aired in 2002 I was an instant fan. When it was cancelled I was crushed. In the first few episodes the writing, directing, acting, music... everything was more professional and polished than shows on the air for many years. The characters were oustanding and the world created for them was so vast that the story possibilities were nearly endless.Amazon.com became my favorite place to buy the DVD box set when it became available (ASIN B0000AQS0F). I bought several sets for myself (intending to loan them to friends that missed the show on TV) and several more for gifts. So many of my friends watched and instantly fell in love with the show! If you haven't seen it, buy it here on Amazon, and add Serenity to your order.Why? Because the TV series had a grand story arc that was cut short by its cancellation. An incredibly compelling mystery was set up and we were denied its resolution. Then Executive Producer Joss Whedon worked with Universal to bring Firefly to the big screen in the form of Serenity. This major motion picture offers the perfect resolution to one of the main mysteries explored by the series and at the same time stands alone as a fantastic science fiction movie.So few filmmakers make something that packs so much action, humor, suspense and drama into 2 hours. It feels like the entire 2nd season of the TV show was packed into this one film. I saw Serenity 5 times in the theater and look forward to seeing it many more on DVD!So go ahead, click to buy! You won't regret it, and the friends and family members you loan it to (or buy it for) will love it!	5.0	I can't stop thinking about this movie!	2005-11-01	19	19	0

You don't need to have seen the dvd of firefly as I went in cold and had no trouble knowing whats going on as the movie takes care of all of that for you in the first 20 mins or so.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1QLZMPVXL281Y	Antony M. Teofilo	I watched the movie, Serenity, first.  I was intrigued.  Then, I went back and watched Season 1 of Firefly.  Then I watched it again.  And again.  Then I came back to the movie just as this worthy special edition was released.Do it backwards, or forwards, or inside out.  It doesn't matter.  If you have an appreciation for good storytelling, you'll be truly hooked on both the television show and the film.  The series is like a huge 'origins' easter egg that supports the film.  The crazy thing is that this statement is also true the other way around.  Nearly every intricate plot point of interest in the series is paid off in the movie in big ways...but you don't have to watch the series to dig the movie.  If you're a writer, try to get your aspiring noodle around THAT one.Serenity is a stupendous film full of characters with real conflict, real human value.  This film is an amazing balancing act in plot, humor, and daring tragedy.Pick up this flick.  It's worth it many times over.New frontiers.  Freedom.  Brotherhood.

After recently rewatching Firefly I decided to watch the spin off movie Serenity.Other reviewers have covered the plot and even the themes of this movie much more in depth so I won't.This movie is about a group of people who are on a space ship operating just outside of the law on the edge of space. They take care of each other and form a family of sorts. They also, when they can, fight against the government.The acting is good. Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors. There is action and quite a bit of it in this movie. If you enjoy science fiction/fantasy this is a great movie to watch.

Each of the actors is cast perfectly, particularly Chiwetel Ejifor as the Operative and Summer Glau as River.  The humor is great, the action and special effects entertaining and the characters are facinating.  The story of criminals fighting against the perfect society and seeking to make the truth known never gets old.  If you are avoiding this movie because of the bad reviews, don't! It is well worth seeing even if you are not a fan of the genre.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A9AZJGWMDJ7SR	A Reader	I saw a few episodes of `Firefly' but never got hooked and probably only saw two episodes from start to finish. I was impressed with various aspects of the show but the heavy western theme just did not interest me. Thankfully in `Serenity' the aspects of `Firefly' I did not like are minimized and it improves on the aspects I did like. The result is simply a great film. If you enjoy sci-fi at all and movies such as `Star Wars' and `Star Trek' you will almost certainly like `Serenity'. In fact Serenity is certainly superior to a number of the movies in both of those venerable series.The special effects are inconsistent but always acceptable and sometimes outstanding. The sound is outstanding. The movie has great comical moments as well as creepy ones. The cast does an outstanding job and the cinematography is interesting to say the least.I enjoyed the movie so much I am going to buy the `Firefly' DVD set. If you did not like `Firefly' give `Serenity' a shot; I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. If you were a fan of the show this is simply a must get movie.Hopefully the surprise success of `Serenity' will allow them to do a sequel.	4.0	Simply a great movie.	2006-05-21	0	0	0

I didn't; fact, I'd barely even heard of it before  -- and was totally awed from the first 5 minutes, which have got to be one of the coolest intros to any movie ever.This genre-bending, brilliantly witty, moving, exciting, involving and funny trip successfully melds sci-fi and Western conceits, making a story that's not only  exemplary in each field, but transcends both.  It took me right back to that thrill of the exotic & romantic that was first seen on screen in the bar scene in the very first Star Wars, and has hardly ever been equalled in any movie since.  Although nowhere near so grand in scope (obviously; it's not aiming for that), in the seamless creation of a world and characters in whom you can get deeply invested almost immediately, this rivals the LOTR trilogy.  (I know that's saying a lot; I stand by it.)The movie did, of course, totally convert me into a fan, and I've now ordered the Firefly DVD set -- and will somehow need to slow myself down in not watching them all on the first day, since I know there might not be any more to come.  Wotta conundrum.And while it might help to have a liking for sci-fi, I don't think even that is a necessity -- anyone who just likes thrillers of any kind should at least be open to the possibility of not just liking but totally falling for this awe-inspiring work.So there."	5.0	It DOES stand alone -- and might convert you, too	2006-02-19	10	10	0

I started watching the TV shows because Alan Tudyk was in it, and I loved him in everything I had ever seen him in.I didn't see all of the episodes and forgot about it when it wasn't on TV anymore.  Then I saw the trailers for the movie.  I wait for movies to come out on DVD then watch them at home.  At last, there the DVD was, and I bought it.I loved it.  Watched it twice, within a few days. Then I bought the Firefly complete series.  I love everything about this.  The humor, the characters... loved it all.I can't wait for more.  I'll take movies, tv series or books.  I loved it, and these characters are so alive.  I couldn't believe that the ""Wash"" character was killed, especially since that is why I started watching in the first place.  The character to kill to me would have been Simon.  He was kind of flat, but oh well.  I still love it.The only complaint I have about this is the amount of profanity in the bonus features, and the kids can get to that.  I watched a bonus feature with my nine year old daughter and Nathan dropped a big fat ugly word before I could turn it off.That issue is not singular to the serentiy/firefly dvds... its an issue in general.

The characters are unique and interesting, their story compelling. I think one thing I really like about the movie is that the bad guy (a trained assassin) has style. Unlike many stories where the villain is either a psycho or worse a poorly written idiot, this antagonist is fresh and fun. He knows what he's doing. He knows that it's wrong. But he also believes that he works for a higher purpose. He's soft spoken, violent, and skilled. It is the character chemistry and beautiful space landscapes that makes this movie so good.If you like the movie, I'd definitely recommend you get the entire Firefly series on DVD. It is also very good, and you will gain a new understanding of the characters from the series.P.S.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3ATTCCO32ZXET	"A. Ryan ""Merribelle"""	It's too dahm bad that the Academy never seriously considers handing an award for Best Film to a Sci Fi movie.  It's even more tragic that, due to the recent ineptitude of writers for both the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises, the vast majority of the moviegoing public will never even consider seeing what I believe is superlative cinematic storytelling in Serenity, writer/creator Joss Whedon's latest and best effort to date.For those of you who have seen last season's cancelled series Firefly (there's a sad tale in there all its own), this film is a splendid wrap-up, done with Joss Whedon's typical style and wit and an atypically luxurious budget for cinematography.  That's all I need say for you folks, but for those who haven't had the pleasure of getting to know Serenity's crew through the tv show, how to describe it...perhaps as a Space Western written for smart people?  No, that sounds snobbish, when I was only trying to make the point that the dialogue was more intelligent than what casual SF movie fans might have come to expect in recent years.Aw heck, here's all you need to know about Serenity:  a plot that involves lots of action, eye candy (in the form of great SFX, cinematography and good-looking actors), and classic human drama;  just enough humor to keep it from getting overwhelming; and the right amount of philosophy to ponder in the aftermath.  You can enjoy it whether you've ever watched Firefly or not, whether you care for megaSF like Star Wars or not, and whether you're in it for the characters or the fights.Bless you Joss...please keep `em coming.-Andrea, aka Merribelle	5.0	Howling good story, well told in film.	2005-10-02	22	20	2

I strongly recommend that you pick up the Firefly season along with this DVD.  The show and the movie have characters that are easy to love and hate.  My favorite part about both the movie and the series is how the characters all make fun of and mess with each other.

It is action-packed and humorous, without being silly and trite. The characters are interesting and the new un-polished view of the space travel of our future is refreshing. It's what we love about the old Star Wars films, wihtout copying their formula. There's no pretentious Jedi or awful Hayden Christiansen acting. The main characters, specifically Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) are quite likeable, even without the backstory. In fact, what I liked best about the film (and the series) are the characters. They are some of the most relatable characters out there. Despite the futuristic setting, the struggles and relationshps the characters have are easy to follow.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2TJMNDHSGN3H5	as-seen-on-tv	"For me, Serenity was one of the most anticipated movies of 2005.I had been a fan of the series Firefly shortly after the DVD release and eagerly awaited the films release. Like millions of others, I was immediately drawn into Joss Whedon's show that included characters with realistic emotions, thick and overlapping plots and a great sense of humor, all of which are rarely seen in sci-fi let alone any type of television. With that being said Fox (as they have done so many times before, latest victim: Arrested Development) prematurely canceled a great series. Fortunately, the sole season of Firefly, along w/ unaired episodes, was released on DVD in 2003 to overwhelming success. And that's how we get to Serenity.So much was left unsaid in the series finale, so many questions were unanswered. Although it would have been a nice way to go, the last show was more of a sign of this that COULD HAVE come rather than a sign of this TO come. With Serenity, the basic premise of Objects in Space is expanded all throughout the Firefly 'verse in a 120 minuet epic that should exceed any fans wildest expectations.Serenity has everything a fan of Firefly could ask for and more. The story is so emotional, especially in the final 25 minuets, that it feels as if Firefly never left.You will be reminded of the first line in the show's theme song all throughout the movie as the story (for now) come full circle.

The start of the movie sort of recaps what we learn in the television series, which is understandable, as many of the movie fans may not have seen the series first. It is a shame that some of the main characters from the series don't have very big parts in the movie, but that isn't a negative. Serenity is a fun, action packed, science fiction adventure. The crew travel from planet to planet, as they are hunted by the govenment. Some of the lines still make me laugh after watching them about twenty times.

The fast pacing, storyline, special effects, and interplay of characters were really  good, and what you wished Episodes I-III of Star Wars would've been (though I liked IV to VI).  The amazing thing about this film is that it cost ~$40? mil to make which really puts a lot of the more expensive special effects films to shame.  Some of the scenes really could illicit a visceral reaction, which is so hard to get from Hollywood these days... even the jokes were funny.  I might add that I'm a bit jaded when it comes to watching movies these days, so when I like a film, it had to have done something incredibly well.This was a worthwhile rental and even a purchase if you like owning SCi-Fi DVDs.	5.0	So much better than recent Star Wars Flicks	2006-01-16	0	0	0

Surprisingly we were in a good size theater and there were only six other people there to watch it.  Almost as private as watching it at home.  Hopefully the news of this movie will spread via word of mouth and the theaters will fill up some more.Gotta say, this was a very good movie.  Not just another TV quality episode, but a full blown movie quality show.  Unlike other sci-fi blockbusters from earlier in the summer that were disappointing, this one really delivers on both effects and story line.  The cast relationships have the same feel that they did in the dvd series, though Mal is somewhat darker, and even more dangerous, than he was on TV.  It even fills in some of the storyline holes that you were left hanging on after the 11th TV episode.If you like Firefly, definitly go see it.  If you like SciFi, definitly go see it.  If you like a good story, lots of action, good character interaction, clever scripting, go see it.  If you like ""The Sound of Music"", well you might not want to see this, its a little over the edge on the action for the grandmothers in the audience (unless your grandmother is like my grandmother and is a little over the edge herself!)Anyway, I just wanted to add to the word of mouth effort to spread the news about this movie.  I'd like to see the second movie come out ASAP.  Then the next TV series, then the game, then the action figure, then the...  You get the picture.  Go see this one.

However, I have a fear, a fear that this would only cheapen and dilute what we have already known to come and love.  Once the gorram networks get their claws back in the series they will try their best to mold it to their fashion.  And I know none of us want that.  The team came together and did a great job and the intro of Chiwetel as a cold blooded killer was a stroke of genius.  He was scary.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A33VYK55SK5B4S	"B. Allen-Trick ""Meatrace"""	I will preface this review by saying that I am in no way a Joss Whedon fan. I hated Buffy and Angel. I think the show Firefly is fantastic if a bit overrated. Know then that when I say this movie is spectacular it is untainted by bias.This movie is SPECTACULAR. I think that everyone involved did a remarkable job in making this both a respectable extension of the television show and an entertaining standalone action movie. They both wrapped up the River Tamm storyline neatly and left breathing room for a possible sequel(s), whatever form that might take at this point.The dialogue is fresh and believable, the acting is inspired, the characters are as fans will tell you memorable, and the effects are awesome. Let's face it though, Joss Whedon's hallmark is coming up with a clever idea, memorable characters and letting the characters and dialog move the show. So what about the plot? Well at least he was smart enough to know his one weakness and steal from one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time-Forbidden Planet. Which is forgivable since Forbidden Planet stole from Shakespear.So I guess that makes Serenity Shakespearian! Cool. Well, at any rate, it's probably the best most original sci-fi movie we'll see for some time.	5.0	Excellent character driven space opera	2006-02-06	8	7	1

This movie was created by the force of fandom, and while it may not stand up to the best episode of the one-year series, it allows fans to revisit their favorite characters (although it would have been nice to have spent more time with &#34;Preacher&#34;). It fulfills some incomplete story lines that were cut short by the show's cancellation and also has some surprises -- happy and sad. Fans will love it, and those who have not seen the series need not be knowledgeable to enjoy the movie.	5.0	A nice summary of a great television series, gone too soon	2013-03-05	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"I understand this is a movie that started with a TV series called ""Firefly,"" and therefore it's probably not surprising that I didn't understand everything that went on. I saw some things that reminded me of Star Wars, some of Star Trek, and some of . . . well, other science fiction stories more generally. The girl River made me think of Lord of the Rings. But that's OK; it's all put together in a rather unique combination.At one level, this is a swashbuckling heroes adventure story. At another, it's a war story. Lots of technology for the nerds. And some rather spacey spiritual stuff, too. There's even a touch of romance. Just when I thought I understood (sort of) what was going on, something completely unexpected threw me off again. The fact is, it's got me hoping for a sequel.The basic story, as I understand it, is that in the far future, there came to be a major division among inhabited planets between those on the outer edges and those toward the center of ""civilization"" who formed an empire-like central government that behaves as if it is benevolent, and may even believe itself to be. But River saw the flaw even as a child in the opening scene. They meddle. They're not into freedom, they're into peace. In fact, the entire story seems to be about the tension between those two goals. River is the subject of some strange mind-control experiment that is really very spooky, but not well defined at first. Her older brother, a medical doctor, risks much to get her free from the authorities, but then she and her brother are hunted. It's clear she has been made into some sort of a weapon, but in exactly what way takes a while to be revealed.Anyway, her brother takes her back to the ship Serenity, where he has been ship's doctor while the ship is engaged in a variety of mercenary missions, some of them even legal. (Millenium Falcon, anyone?) Captain Mal is not happy with having a fugitive on board against his will, but reluctantly takes her along because there doesn't seem to be a lot of options. And she does have some useful talents, as he soon discovers.The crew is actually fighting two enemies: the Empire (OK, I may be going a little too much into the Star Wars analogy, but I don't recall what the authoritarians were called) and some rather horribly cannibalistic sub-humans called Reavers (think Tuscan Raiders). They don't just eat people, they prefer to eat them while they are still alive. Brace yourself: toward the end of the story we find out how the Reavers got that way. Not pleasant, not at all.There's also a Haven planet, run by a gentle sort called the Shepherd, and there's a mysterious planet that the authorities have gone to great lengths to keep secret. Yes, there are lots and lots of threads to this plot. I may watch it again someday.Four stars. I'd give it five if I understood better what was going on. There's a lot of action way too fast for me to follow, and sometimes people say things I simply do not get. Otherwise I'd probably give it five."	4.0	Good Science Fiction, But Not the Best	2012-05-13	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A34FV327JWDP7Y	"BATRON ""RON KRETSCHMER"""	Joss Whedon's space western didn't find a wide audience on televison and was unceremoniously yanked from Fox's lineup despite rock solid writing.  Given the choice to make money or make quality programs, broadcasters logically chose the former.  Fortunately, the story didn't end there for the nomad ship, the Serenity.  The crew and the beloved bucket of bolts they call home, return on the big screen this time.  Malcom Reynolds [Nathan Filton] and his ragtam team of space buccaneers are harboring a pint size weapon in the form of a girl named River [Summer Glau].  She has used her mind reading abilities to inadvertantly garner some secrets that the evil Alliance doesn't want found out.  This leads to deadly entanglements with the Alliance, space cannibals called Reavers and a forgotten planet named Miranda.  Serenity's staff soon learns that the 90 pound waif that has been riding around with them is capable of taking on whole groups of weapon toting henchman by herself without breaking a nail.  You don't need to be a fan of the television series to enjoy this science fiction saga [as of this writing I have yet to see any of the 14 episodes].  The characters are well drawn out and the plot isn't so terribly complicated that you can't figure out the basic details quick enough to keep up with the fast moving script.  The movie has a silly, spaghetti western feel to it that somehow comes across as charming and amusing rather than quirky and annoying.  Comparisons to the Star Wars universe are inevitable, but Serenity doesn't get swallowed up by expectations of grandeur and legacy.  It is free to be razor sharp, witty and simply enjoyable.  At times, the George Lucas films seem to take themselves a little too seriously.  That is never a problem with Serenity.  Joss Whedon manages a near perfect balance between serious action sequences and humor.	5.0	CHARMING SPAGHETTI SPACE WESTERN	2005-12-02	30	29	1

You really know and care about these people so I will admit to the movie being more enjoyable to fans of the series. What a surprise. I do think the movie holds it's own as a separate entity however. To anybody that says this movie was predictable : could you please email me tonight's winning lotto numbers. I haven't been this entertained since the first time I saw Star Wars in 1977. I would love to see another one or the series brought back but if this is all I get I am extremely grateful for this. Everyone in the theater I saw it in applauded at the end and you don't see that very often. For a movie with this much entertainment value to only do 25 mil at the box office is beyond me.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3BLLZ4SBPZOND	"Beatrice Joy ""Shivalaya"""	Serenity is a tale that I fully recommend to everyone who is intrigued with adventure, loyalty, action and romance. The movie  exhibits grace, realism, some romance but also a sense for the search of truth and the human element of compassion for others. Each of the individual actors plays his or her part extremely well, and you can clearly sense that they really want to act their part and want to be in that make believe fantasy world; every single one of them is a true star; it is seldom to see such real acting and it puzzles me why these actors have never been more on the forefront of the cinema screen. The part of the secret operative sent to eliminate River, the girl searched for by the empire and gifted with psychic abilities, is played very well; his melancholic and somewhat sad nature contrasts beautifully with the never giving up captain of the Serenity crew, who even after having almost lost all his people in the war with the empire and is thoroughly dissapointed with the world and himself, still manages to find plenty of courage to come to the rescue of River and her brother. This element of compassion is a very strong theme in the movie and is the guiding principle from the beginning to the end. Even the slightly worn out idea of saving the universe from the manipulation of a degraded empire, still does it extremely well in this beautifully made movie.	5.0	A well acted sci-fi movie	2006-03-04	7	7	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	Serenity satisfactorily answers some lingering questions from the too-soon-aborted Firefly television series, leaves a few more hanging and perhaps even opens up a few for future projects.It's also, for those who didn't see the series, either on television or on DVD, a grungy, lived-in universe like the Aliens universe, but one where the greatest threat is humanity.Some of the quirks of the TV series have been toned down: It's not quite so blatantly a post-Civil War Western in space, and some of the cutesier character bits have been relegated to the deleted scenes portion of the DVD. The film will be most enjoyable for those who have seen the series, but it's still fun for those who haven't.It also has a stronger narrative through-line than the often leisurely television episodes, better special effects and make-up and even better writing. (The dialogue has more of a future-archaic feel which adds a great deal of realism to the proceedings.)Bring on the next sequel!Strongly recommended for fans of Firefly and anyone who loved Han Solo back when he shot first.	4.0	Well, ain't that a thing?	2006-03-25	4	4	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ABFMBLOJ0SIYY	Benjamin J. Moore	"Sci-Fi, Western, drama, comedy, action-adventure, space opera, whatever you want to call it, this film is all heart.  The characters are quickly outlined and filled in, brought to life in their interactions with each other and the breakneck pace of the plot.  If it feels a bit rushed compared to most films, that is only because this movie has so much more to say.  This movie is not about space, politics, or good and evil, it is about people.  An unusually large cast of ""main characters"" is quickly and adeptly introduced to you, each of which is endearing in their own peculiar way.  A doctor with endless devotion to his sister, a mechanic with an unstoppable sunny disposition, a quirky and somewhat goofy pilot, a caring and wise religious man, a mildly dimwitted yet powerful mercenary, the doctor's tortured and talented young sister, an unfailingly loyal first mate, a stunning and adoring companion, and the rugged realist who captains them all in their attempts to carve out a life for themselves on the edge of civilization.The companion is actually a prostitute, and yet somehow she is the only character with any real social status and respectability in society.  And it doesn't bother you or seem quaint.  In the amazing world that has been created here, it just seems normal.That being said, so interested in every aspect of the ""verse"" due to brilliant and witty dialogue sprinkled over a deep and involving plot, I could have easily sat for another two hours if they had chosen to dig deeper into this world.  I swear I thought the whole thing lasted only 40 minutes.  The world Mr. Whedon has created is teeming with depth and completeness that draws you in quickly, and seems tangible from the first scene.As the plot unfolds and the action sets in, the interactions between the characters are engaging and brief, but much like old friends you haven't seen in awhile, you immediately understand where they are coming from and the intricacies and depths of their relationships to each other.  These relationships serve not only to illustrate the story and decisions they face, but they actually drive it forward and add great depth to the conflicts unfolding on screen.  As varied a crew as they are, they seem at home with each other and so real you'd think you might run into them at the shopping mall or grocery store.There is a heartfelt sincerity and love that is exuding from the experience of this film, and I consider myself lucky to have caught it at the end of its run in the theatres.  On a Sunday afternoon, with a rather old crowd and about a half-full theatre, the audience actually stood up and applauded this film when it finished.  A sixty year old woman walked out with tears in her eyes, and I myself actually had trouble driving all the way home, so many thoughts about family and friends were racing through my head.This film is all heart.  If you have a heart, you should buy it."	5.0	All Heart	2005-12-12	28	27	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A101C99CG8EFUH	Benjamin McGough	"Initially, I really liked Serenity.  I understood why the emotional events near the end were necessary, and I even approved in a way.  Then time passed, and I began to think about this being the end of Firefly for all time, and my opinion of the movie changed.  I was disappointed and angry, and felt let down by some of the choices the filmmaker made; he seemed to cave in to marketing pressures in ways he never did during the TV series.But now that I've had several months to reflect (and watch it on DVD), I've decided that while Serenity has flaws, and is arguably not as good as the series, I'm glad it was made, and I do enjoy watching it (if sometimes only to reminisce about how wonderful the series was).Since I have seen all the episodes of Firefly, and I'm very familiar with the characters, I am not able to comment on how enjoyable Serenity is as ""a sci-fi movie"", but I was impressed with the visual impact of the film, it had some really good lines, and has a plot that holds together at least as well as any other recent sci-fi movie."	4.0	Yes, it has flaws...	2006-02-23	3	0	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A20EEWWSFMZ1PN	"bernie ""xyzzy"""	This movie is more of a space parody on the line of Galaxy Quest (1990) (just missing Alan Rickman) or maybe Down Periscope (1996). This presentation has every space, cowboy, militaries,  and clich&eacute; in the book.Of course, this must be much more to the old TV series fans. However, as a standalone film it is just one of those things.  Standard ninja bad people, and outlaws vs. empires.  Sexy women and bare feet.  Speaking of feet, the internet even has blogs about summer's feet. I cannot repeat it here.Be sure to watch the extra DVD goodies (bonus material) and the BD-Live: My scenes. The U-Control function can be a tad distractive. When you see what they were, trying to accomplish the next time through the presentation will be more enjoyable. The Blu-ray treatment is impressive but I never saw the original to compare.Basic story is about the lives of the crew and visitors on the spaceship Serenity as they are pursued by the authorities for knowledge they may possess that can disrupt the perfect society.  Does the Crew know what they carry and will they find the secret before they are squashed like a bug.Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition) ~ Tim Allen	5.0	Fun formula space movie, Summer flashes her feet	2009-01-25	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2WBJZ10VPJOTD	Beth Case	If you saw this movie and didn't love it, go watch the DVDs of the TV series.  While the movie stands on it's own, it's kinda like watching a Star Trek movie if you'd never seen the series.  You get it, but there's a lot of history and character development you don't know that adds depth to the story.  The characters are very complex, and there's so much behind what appears on the surface to be only an action flick.  The depth of characters and quality of the writing and dialogue leaves any other SF movie I've ever seen (including all Star Wars and Star Trek movies, Matrix, etc.) in the dust.	5.0	More than just an action flick	2005-11-07	10	9	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1PL8IHJHZOXIT	"B. Hyde ""wifemomwriter"""	I see there are a lot of Firefly and Joss Whedon fans in thrall to the movie.  They hit you over the head with their thrall.  Then there are those expecting big splash FX, the kind of FX that carry and make a movie and are disappointed.  There are also the inevitable comparisons to Star Trek, Star Wars and movies/characters that have gone before.  All that is drivel and not in the least flattering to the creator, the movie or the reviewer.So, never saw the series while it was on it's short-lived TV run.  However, after seeing the preview, I was intrigued enough to check out and then purchase the series on DVD and watch it.  I personally don't care that the creator/writer has had other successful series.  This was the one I was focusing on at the moment.  Past success and/or fame does not automatically make something great.I really enjoyed the story-line and the characters.  I enjoyed the ambiance of the ship Serenity and it's multiple meaning.  I really loved the fact that in the movie, none of that was changed.  It didn't get bigger or more enhanced because it was being put on the big screen.  Both myself and my husband saw this movie together - he had never seen any of the series.  We both liked it very much.I will not go into specific details about the movie, enough have already done that.  One of the best things I can and will say is we want to see it again and we will add it to our video library.And a parting for those of you appalled that they should kill off two of the orignial cast...has it occurred to you that if there is a revival, they were the only two not to commit and could you see them played by any other actor...	4.0	Worth the Time to see now and again...	2005-10-07	8	6	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3OWMIJJB2NCDS	"Big Kid ""Robert"""	I watch this movie about once every two months.  The HD-DVD version is spectacular.  I watched the Firefly series on DVD after seeing this movie and loved it as well.  I can't believe I missed this when it was on TV.  It really is sad they cut this series.The future, the past, sci-fi, cowboys, six-shooters, samurai swords, space ships, zombie-like bad guys, a high-priced escort, and a sexually frustrated female mechanic.  That might sound crazy, but it works so well.Switching between English and Chinese is perfect and adds character to this great movie.  Cursing without cursing (like in Battlestar Galatica) is a nice touch.River is [...] in this film - too bad they didn't get this far in the series.  She's a true WMD - they should have found her in Iraq.The captain of Serenity has the perfect blend of toughness, honor, and heart.Don't miss this if you love Sc-Fi.  Watch the series first if you can, but either way you'll enjoy this over and over.UPDATE - the Blu-ray version is even better than the HD-DVD.  I also rewatched the entire Firefly collection on Blu-ray.	5.0	Maybe my favorite Sci-Fi movie of all time!	2007-08-13	10	10	0

But the major plot is that the Alliance wants River Tam in the worse way, and has sent an assassin to find her. He will stop at nothing to obtain his prize. I won't give away too much, but I will put it this way, River does possess some serious skills when threatened.To fully appreciate the last 1/3 of the movie, you should watch ALL of the series. You will understand.Contrary to what other reviewers have stated, this isn't the end. Joss Whedon wants to make more big-screen chapters of Firefly.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2POYXTGSPSW7O	Bill Hensler	"I really liked Serenity.  Why?  I look as the show as more related to Babylon 5 than to Star Trek, where the universe if perfect and everything turns out just nice.  This movie is about the spaceship Serenity where you're lucky if the spaceship just plain works.Serenity does a good job of projecting people into the future in a believable future.  The producers of the movies have slightly changed the way English is spoken.  Personally, I though this was a wonderful touch to the movie.  It gives a viewer a sense that things really have changed in the future.  I thought the speech patterns were quite believable.  I'm so bored of ""Picard"" and ""Data"" perfectly speaking the King's English.  On Serentity you'll get introduced to a form of English that seems like a cross between the old West and the Future.  The pattern of speech takes some getting used to.Serenity does a good job of showing the problem with a future government, the Alliance.  In the Alliance all people are equal but the civilized planets are just more equal than the uncivilized outer planets.  The basic cause of the problems in the universe is an out-of-control central government that wants to control all human behaviour.The plot of Serenity is the Alliance finally decides to hunt down River because River had the opportunity and ability to mind scan some high Alliance governmental officials.  I shall not give too much away to the Amazon.com reader.  Why?  It will wreck your viewing of the movie.The effects on the big screen are a lot better than what was done in the TV show of the movie.  Also, because this show was made for the big screen a little more could be done with the cast of characters.Serenity is a fun movie.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5.  I grade DVD movies much harder than books.  This movie will not go down as the best Sci-Fi ever made.  But this movie is a solid grade B+.  And what is wrong with just seeing a good movie?Serenity has action.  It explains the source of the Reavers.  It cleans up the back ground on River.  A long standing ship board romance gets going.  And we get to see some regretful goodbyes.Also, the movie has some parts on the design of the Firefly class ships, the crew of Serenity, and how the series was make.  It was quite good and informative.If you liked Firefly then you'll really like this movie.My only wish is Firefly had been picked up by the Science Fiction channel and made into a series.  A replacement for some of their more elderly shows is badly needed.  But life isn't perfect.  That is why I liked this movie; it isn't perfect either.4 stars.  You'll like it.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	APUGA2XWX1IIX	Bishop Bowie	I'm going to go against the flow, and risk getting flamed, by saying I think the movie is better than the series.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the series, and was upset when it got cancelled.  I own the box set.  However, I think that by wrapping things up in the theatrical format made Whedon focus more on the nuts and bolts of his story, and gave us a very tightly written and intensely satisfying film.Yes, a lot of scenes in the movie could have been drawn out for weeks in a series, but then it would have felt like a lot of filler/fluff was put in place where it wasn't needed.I equate this movie to a modern day Star Wars.  It was done on a shoestring budget.  It has the edgie feel that Star Wars had when it first came out.  It surpassed most peoples expectations in quality and viewing enjoyment.Serenity is similar enough to other sci-fi movies to make the viewer comfortable, yet original enough to keep the viewer engaged.I love this movie, and I think any true sci-fi fan will as well.	4.0	I liked the movie better	2007-01-29	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3BHJR2B6F8OU2	B. Jerlinga	Generally, people think of sci-fi as being nerdy, unapproachable, unrelatable, and so on. But Serenity (and Firefly as well, obviously) does something that most sci-fi does not-- it focuses on the characters, their day to day struggles and the things that motivate them-- not intergalactic space adventure. Not wacky alien species. But the lives of people, people not so different than you.As an audience, we may not be able to relate to travelling to another moon, but we can almost all relate to having a car that others laugh at for being junky, but that we love-- because its reliable, and familiar, and is a little mobile home. Such is the same with the good ship Serenity. Most of us have at one point sacrificed something for someone else. We've felt the ache as a loved one turned and left. We've cursed the job market and printed up dozens of resumes. So do the characters, and so, even if they are kicking ass, or running in a cowardly fashion, or whatever-- we believe them. They are endearing because many of their plights are similar to our own.Another thing that separates Serenity from the rest-- it isnt cliche. All bets are off in Whedon's universe. Things happen that you don't expect, and that you probably wont like at first... but what it comes down to is good storytelling. In the real world, anything could happen. Things don't go as planned. Things aren't wrapped up in perfect little boxes. In Serenity, it is the same. The story is grand. The music is lilting, lovely, heartbreaking, heroic, haunting, exuberant, fearless. The script is peppered with humor, but nothing that seems out of place.Serenity isn't a movie for sci-fi lovers. Serenity is a movie for everyone.	5.0	Serenity: A Movie for All	2005-11-03	35	33	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q8MUUIEHHEON	BJP	I had to rate it 5 stars because that's what the movie deserves. However, I'm pretty sure that the blu-ray case is used. It was scuffed and scratched, very dull blue as opposed to my other blu-rays, and there were scraps of the sticky plastic material on the top and side (the stuff you usually have to peel off to open). All of this was under plastic wrap so I know the scuffs and scratches were not just rough handling, I think they just put a new blu-ray disk in a used case and switched out the paper insert. Anyway not that big of a deal but the dull scratched blue definitely stands out against my other blu-rays in the rack. Unless you're a perfectionist this probably won't matter, unfortunately I am.	5.0	The movie is phenomenal, the case not so much	2012-02-02	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A189BPUDLRCQEQ	"B. Kemper ""Buzz"""	I am a Sci-Fi fan, but it is often difficult to find really great, non-cheesy shows. The Firefly series was truly great; it has extremely high-level characters, acting and writing mixed with edge-of-your-seat action sequences. The only flaw was that it was cancelled much too soon. Without this movie, the series would have left the viewer hanging, with several vital plot twists left unresolved. This movie takes care of that. As others here have wisely pointed out, see this movie only AFTER watching the series. Then, after watching the last episode and feeling frustrated as all Firefly fans were, cue up this movie and watch the magic as Joss Whedon does a very satisfying job of wrapping it all up. It doesn't all resolve as I might have wanted it to--there is some tragedy here--but if you liked the series, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. And, for what it's worth, here is one vote for Whedon, or someone of equal brilliance, to do another series. This one was amazingly good.	5.0	Great ending to this short-lived series	2012-10-19	1	0	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3UEQ9S4Y1VGQF	B. K. Stepp	I recently finished watching the series on DVD and enjoyed it, but I was blown away by this movie.  I enjoyed it so much that I immediately watched it again with commentary by Joss Whedon.For me the standouts in a fine cast were Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau.  Glau's fight sequences were astounding and surprising considering that her character spent most of the series in a catatonic state.  There are also some surprises that will shock fans of the series.Finally I was very impressed with the cinematography and lighting.  I highly recommend the Whedon commentary to gain an even greater appreciation of some of the intricacies of this very fine film.	5.0	Hot Summer	2007-04-13	7	6	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A275JWKGXHRQ4E	Blake Kendall	This is more of a commentary than actual review, and encompasses both the Firefly TV show and Serenity, since they both involve the same characters and subject material:If you didn't have the privilege or pleasure of seeing this amazing series (Firefly) in its short-lived run on FOX, rejoice in the fact that you can now possess it yourself and watch it for all time whenever you wish. On the surface, it seems like its all about cowboys in space, but there's much more. One of my favorite things about any of Joss Whedon's projects, from Buffy, to Angel, and finally Firefly, is that a great deal of time and care is lavished upon fleshing out and exploring the characters that fill the worlds he creates. In the final season of Angel, we were shown facets of Angel's personality, past and character we hadn't seen before, and that made him all the more real, likeable and interesting. The same is true for Firefly. Despite its short lifespan, great effort was made to explore each character so that in each episode, you were treated to maybe another glimpse into how Capt. Mal met his crew, what was done to River's mind, why Jayne is such an ass (a likeable one, though), and why Inara left the Core Worlds to continue her Companionship. Obviously, there were secrets and details we never learned, such as how a Shepherd would know so much about guns and combat as he does, and where the Reavers came from, but through the magic of the silver screen, Whedon's vision can once again come to life and reveal the rest of the secrets.With the movie SERENITY, Whedon was able to bring his characters out of deep freeze and revive their world once again. The movie takes place maybe a year after the last episode of the TV series, and we know finally learn more about the characters, River most importantly, and the Reavers. The original Star Wars trilogy's (Ep. 4, 5, 6) greatest strength was its focus on the characters and their interactions, especially Empire Strikes Back. Back then, it wasn't only about the technology used to make huge armies and space battles, but about the characters; we cared that Vader was Luke's father, we cared that Han and Leia fell in love and then were separated by a bounty hunter/slab of carbonite. Just so, we care about Whedon's characters: that Buffy died, that Angel became the head of the company that tried to kill him, that Wash died bringing the Serenity's crew safe from the Reavers. That's why Firefly and Serenity are amazing, and that is why you should watch them.	5.0	"""Hey, free soup"" -- Jayne Cobb"	2006-02-23	5	4	1

The story had something for everyone, scares, screams, laughter and intrigue.  In some cases you were laughing one second and gasping a second later.  The characters are richly written and you really feel connected to each and everyone of them, including the assassin!The lead characters, Mal & River, are two totally different people but caught up in the same web by the overly controlling alliance government.  River, a teenage girl, was falsely lured away from her family to attend a school for ""gifted"" children.  But it was a cover for the government to use children with psychic abilities, enhance those natural gifts and use them for their own purposes.  River's brother, realizes something isn't right and rescues his sister and they end up on Mal's ship named Serenity.  Mal is a soldier who fought against the Alliance but was on the losing side and has made every efforts to live on the outskirts of civilization.  But, he feels an obligation to protect River and fight the Alliance assassin that has been sent to hunt her down and kill her.Every character in this movie is interesting and fun to watch.  If you are a fan of the series, you'll already be familiar with the crew of Serenity but you do not need to have seen the series to enjoy this movie.  Joss Whedon does an excellent job of introducing the characters in the beginning of the movie and getting on with a roller coaster of a story.  The villain is one of the best villains I've ever seen in a movie and if there ever is a sequel they could probably spin off something with this guy alone (but I hope not because I want more of the crew of Serenity).I highly recommend this movie.  I'm a huge sci-fi buff and I've seen all the Trek movies and all the Star Wars movies but this one, in my opinion, is the next level of sci-fi entertainment.  Star Wars was a great franchise and really introduced the world to fantastic big screen adventures and Star Trek took a beloved TV show to the big screen and it was a joy to see but Serenity is the best of both these worlds and manages to be that big screen sci-fi adventure that is richly character driven and a blast to experience."	5.0	Wonderful Sci-fi adventure!	2005-11-01	13	12	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	"With so many reviews, it is hard to imagine there is something I can say which has not already been said, except to add my vote to the chorus of five star reviews. The film is a strange mixture of Star Wars action / adventure and Blade Runner suspense. Lead character Malcolm Reynolds, played to a tee by Nathan Fillion, is far more the hard as nails Rick Deckard than he is the carefree Han Solo. He has strong loyalties to his crew and to those who help him in his shadowy half legal / half bandit role as an old fashioned highwayman of the 'verse (contraction for ""universe"").The heavy, an Alliance ""Operative"" has the determination of an unturned Terminator, who is a lot smarter and more wily than the humanoid androids (and smarter than the replicants of ""Blade Runner"", although the final fight between Reynolds and The Operative is vaguely reminiscent of the fight between Deckard and Roy Batty.The plot resolves two of the biggest questions arising out of the world of the ""Firefly"" series. Why are Alliance agents so intent of recovering control of the mysterious River Tam. The opening of the story proper (after a flashback on River's rescue) shows part of why she is so valuable. She is psychic, reliably. It doesn't come and go. It is not hit and miss. She saves the crew's bacon more than once by using that ability. The second question, not explored deeply in the series, is what is the origin of the ""Reavers"". It is hard to say more without giving away the surprise resolution.The special effects are primitive, and a lot of laws of physics are given too little attention, such as the famous problem of gravity while in outer space. Unlike the compulsively accurate Stanley Kubrick (or James Cameron), and like virtually everyone else, the problem is ignored. The space ship design would probably work in space, but it's ability to land from and take off to space, and fly in the atmosphere, seems quite improbable. But none of that seems to matter, because the story is so, so good.The cast is strong, and it is great to see Ron Glass (of Barney Miller fame) in a role. Most of the characters have a depth to them, such as Adam Baldwin, who plays the heavy weapons toting ""Animal Mother"" character he created in ""Full Metal Jacket"", but his backstory (shown better in the movie than in the series) is delightful, as he regularly communicates with his mother. The most interesting is the triangle between Malcolm the captain, Zoe, his second in command, and her husband, Wash, the pilot. Zoe and Malcolm fought in the rebellion before Zoe met Wash, and there is sometimes a conflict between, command, duty, and loyalty.And... there are two of the most unusual fight scenes you will ever see... Can't say more about that.This is more than worth the cost of admission (whoever, the squeamish may cash in before the film is over.)"	5.0	Should be rated among the best sci-fi movies	2013-05-26	1	1	0

Honestly the movie on its own merits deserves 4 1/2 stars do to minor plot holes and some ackward character development. That said, this DVD deserves 6 stars (if that is even possible) do to the shear fact that I damn near laughed my self in to a coma when I saw the Outtakes reel. Nathan Fillon should be a stand up comedian, but I'm damn glad he can act cause this movie wouldn't be the same without him. If you have even an ickling of humor in your body, or you like a good action flick then pick this DVD up while you still have a chance.

The series was better with the mysteries unanswered.If you're not a fan of the series, for only a bit more than the cost of this movie you can buy the four DVD and get four times as much entertainment."	3.0	Watch the TV series instead	2005-12-31	40	10	30

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A108A421PC6MH3	Bob Stout	"First of, I readily admit I'm a Firefly fan - not a Josh Whedon fan, but a Firefly fan. Having said that, I firmly believe you needn't ever have seen the TV series to enjoy this movie.Even though most reviews have been positive, I'd like to start out by addressing the negative comments... The first is that it will only appeal to fans of the TV series. As stated above, I don't believe this to be the case and what little feedback I've heard from non-fans has borne out this assumption. Secondly, some have criticized the budget and FX. I'd argue that big budgets aren't necessary to a good SF movie and often get in the way (think George Lucas). In Serenity, there was only one scene, lasting maybe 2 seconds, where the CGI was clearly showing and not up to par, but I can forgive that. The important part is that the FX/CGI are in the service of the script, rather than the other way around.Finally, let's talk performances... One of the thing that people most liked about Firefly was the quality and coherence of the ensemble cast. Wisely (or maybe not - remember the meager budget), Whedon resisted the temptation to toss in a few expensive ""big names"" to punch up the box office. The cast still clicks like a well-oiled machine. The audience can respond to their cohesiveness. We easily believe this wildly disparate group of people actually care about  each other.*** Warning: Minor spoilers ahead ***More importantly, even the most reprehensible characters have redeeming qualities, dictated by their histories. There are no 2-dimensional good or evil characters. Each has multiple aspects and layers that helps us believe that they're real people rather than archetypes. We may not approve of all of them, all the time, but we do understand them.For far too long, SF films and TV has been focused on action and FX. Even many of the classics (e.g. 2001) are emotionally sterile. Where character development was pursued, I found it often difficult to really care about them (e.g. Blade Runner). While the crew of Serenity might never be the sort of folks I'd seek out to hang around with, they are people I could respect and understand - even in their more questionable choices.I expect to see this at least twice more in the theater, and will then eagerly await the DVD release.Now, if they'd only make a Babylon 5 movie..."	5.0	Great - accessible and character-driven	2005-10-01	21	18	3

Even if you have never seen the series this movie originated from it's ok as it's a great movie on it's own. The actors are mainly those from the original series with a couple additions that fit right in.The movie gets quite intense in a few areas and does keep you very much interested. I didn't want to pause it to take a break but did to kick a few people out of the house so I could watch in peace and continue to enjoy a well-done movie.It's a shame the series had to be canceled but that's show biz I guess. The movie was basically an ending to the entire series that could have easily gone for another couple of season. All in all it was a great movie that put a lot of information and action into a 2-hour movie.HD Video: 4.5 star, There are a couple of scenes that were a little grainy but for the most part the quality was exceptional.AUDIO: 4.5 stars, I use a 5.1 system and I caught myself looking around the room a couple times thinking a few cuss words as some sounds caught me off guard and made me look.

It's visually interesting without the special effects being overdone; it's fast-paced and entertaining; and the dialogue is snappy and fun. Reminiscent of the first Star Wars, it shows a ""realistic"" future and ""flawed"" heros rather than the idealistic future and bigger-than-life heros of adventures like Star Trek.  We need to see more movies with these fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants adventures...If you can't stand adventure movies, science-fiction or fantasy, you should steer clear of this gem, as you will never give it a proper chance.

I saw the movie first and, telling my brother about it, I got the reply ""Oh, that sounds like the Firefly series that was on tv.""  Well, you can all guess what happened next: off to finf ""Firefly"" dvd.  Couple of yrs later, I've watched ""Serenity"" about 3 times and ""Firefly"" about 4.  I wait several months between so I don't burn out,but I don't really think I can.  This whole storyline is really incomparable.  We all thought that about other scifi series until this came along.  Everything is perfect: the unique concept, the acting, even the design of the ship.  If you watch one dvd after the other, thru the whole series, you will feel you are living it.  Everyone involved in the production cared so much about their project, they bring you in and carry you along.  I believe that is one reason for its popularity.  We all felt so much a part of it, the cancellation felt as tho' they had destroyed OUR homes, OUR lives.  Can someone please! explain to me why they took away this incredible series--and give us crap like ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Jersey Shore""  Was it too intelligent and ""they"" want us ""dumbed down"" or was it too truthful about ""control"", experimentatio, subversive agencies!  What other reason would there be for them to quash a money-maker?  It's not the first time, even historically...remember Galileo, DaVinci, Diego Rivera. the whole Basque nation, Nixon and McCarthy? the list goes on and on.  Does anybody have another reason for one of the stupidest moves a network has ever made? Was it not patriotic enough or too provocative for the sponsors?  Who was behind the curtain this time?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2LEIANN1UZTHP	brainout	When I heard that Joss Whedon was quitting Buffy to make a sci-fi movie, I didn't know Firefly (the series) was his.  This movie is the sequel to the one-season series, with the same cast.  Neither series nor this film depict anything of the sotto voce sociological genius we saw in Buffy.  Very disappointing.Cast is okay, but no chemistry; lapses in continuity, abound.  Series came out a few seasons after Farscape, and has something of the same beginning; except that instead of aliens, it's a human-populated universe.  Mandarin Chinese is spoken as routinely as English, so if you don't speak that language, you miss many of the asides.  Obviously someone was trying to make a point about this being the Asian century.  And as usual, Bible is maligned.  That, with the de rigeur sex and violence, bid for power and money, make the staple of both series and film.  Yawn.Else, you have an eclectic mix of old-time Western and modern sci-fi.  Oh: and the zombies are created by drugs the powers-that-be used to calm and dominate the populus.  That's about the extent of the innovation, in this otherwise trite story.Well, the western music in the series intro and ending, is good.Technically, the special effects and scenery are worth watching once.

Now I'm a fan of the series itself so I will not be objective here but aside from the story itself the quality of the transfer is very good and is blue ray worthy, with good sound as well ( I have a full 5.1 setup, I'll add the 2 rears when more movies support it ). Small niggles are the wish for a longer space battle sequence and more extras, some may even want more bloopers.Unlike most other scifi's this one does not go into wizz bang techie gizmo world but has a feel of realism, the low budget does show but in a good way of how well one can make a low budget movie as there are very many hi cost block busters that are not as well done. It does feel a little like a season finale rather than a movie if your a fan but then again it was meant to end the series off.So recommended for anyone and a worthy addition to any bluray collection, Just wish it did better in the cinema so we could have had another movie."	5.0	fun and entertaining even for non sci fi fans.	2009-03-30	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1TR0WPC93BEC8	"Brendan L. Agnew ""rothwyn"""	"""Nothing here is what it seems.""Science fiction just isn't what it used to be. Over the last couple decades, beginning a few years after George Lucas's Star Wars Trilogy came to a close, sci-fi started to get darker. With films like Blade Runner, Terminator, and Total Recall, dystopian or apocalyptic futures started to invade the genre, supplanting the romps and high-spirited adventuring styles of Buck Rogers and Luke Skywalker. More and more ""darker"" kinds of films like The Matrix, Minority Report and I, Robot became sci-fi staples, with space opera becoming an endangered species, even moreso with Lucas's new lifeless, awkward, lumbering ""vision"" of the Star Wars universe that was employed in the Prequel Trilogy.Fortunately, space opera was still alive and kicking, in the form of a prematurely cancelled TV series from the mind of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel). FireFly launched in 2001, and after a series of idiotic scheduling decisions by Fox, the series was put to rest. However, a legion of fans and suprisingly high DVD sales caught the attention of the movie industry, and creator Whedon, not content to let his baby die, managed to get a movie in the works to finish the story that began on a small transport ship in the backwater of the 'verse.And in 2005, we got Serenity, and a reminder of what made movies like Star Wars a joy in the first place.Now, that doesn't mean that there's nothing dark about the movie; there are both laughs and cries aplenty here. The story of the faithless former soldier and current captain of the ship Serenity, Malcom Reynolds, and his ragtag crew certainly has its share of woe. His medic, Simon, Tam is a fugitive who is trying to keep his mentally unstable (and psychic) sister, River, from the watchful eyes of the totalitarian Alliance, which makes finding paying work (legal or otherwise) that much harder. His compatriots (some of whom qualify as friends) consist of a brilliant and lovestruck mechanic, Kaylee; his former second-in-command, Zoe; her husband and resident idiot-savant pilot, ""Wash""; Inara Senera the courtesan; Darial Book the preacher; and Jayne, a blue-collar killer who has the morals of a wolverine. Mal himself is a man who has lost his faith, and keeps fighting for survival simply to protect those he cares about.And yet, these characters, troubled though they are at times, are what makes this tale so incredible, and despite its tragedy, so uplifting and joyous. The story of their battles against the Alliance, the cold-hearted Operative sent to hunt them down, and the vicious Reavers, crazed cannibals drifting on the edges of the black, is full of fast-paced action, witty banter, and real, full characters that provide such a great emotional anchor that you geniunely care about the entire world (or worlds) they live in. While Serenity has its share of interstellar scraps and old-fashioned shootouts, it is the way the characters resonate with the audience that really makes it feel magical.With surprisingly skillfull camera work for a first-time movie director (thanks to help from technical veterans of movies like Mystic River), as well as more than a little help from David Newman's brilliant score, Serenity soars to new heights of the kind of emotion and entertainment that science fiction can offer. It's a tale of heroes and villains who are, in the end, just people; a story of sorrow, joy, victory, and belief. Nathan Fillion isn't Harrison Ford, and doesn't try to be (though he does a hell of a job of making his character shine), but like the original Star Wars, it's him, the actor and his co-workers and most importantly, their characters, that help Whedon's vision echo back to the glory of science fiction's past.It's what happens when you truly reach for the stars."	5.0	I aim to misbehave. . .	2005-11-07	8	8	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2HZ2J6HVKG1CP	Brian Clifton	"Even though Firefly didn't get to finish its first season, the fan base was large enough for a movie to be made.  Firefly and Serenity are both great ""Science Fiction"" movies for people that hate ridiculous space aliens, beaming up, and all of that.  Both the show and the movie are basically a space western with the same great characters (this movie takes place after the show).I saw Serenity first and then went back and watched the show.  It was so disappointing watching the show toward the end knowing how good the show was and how it was cancelled.  The show is better but this movie is great!  You don't have to watch the show to enjoy Serenity.It's so great to see the entire cast together.  They all play off each other and each have their own interesting dynamics.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	I've yet to see a single episode of the 'Firefly' television series but I will soon now that I've seen 'Serenity.' Plain and simple, this is a wonderfully enjoyable sci-fi, action/adventure film. It has everything you could ask for, intelligent plot, strong chemistry between cast members, excellent special effects, great fight sequences with that blithe little dynamo River (Summer Glau) and lots of cannibalistic zombie-like creatures called Reavers to keep you on your toes. Add to the mix the very sexy Inara (Morena Baccarin) and you've got a big hit on your hands.The cast also includes: Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite (my personal favorite), Sean Maher, Chiwetel Ejiofor and David Krumholtz as Mr. Universe.All and all great fun to be had in front of the T.V. set.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3TUE4JZMN4HYO	"Brian Martin ""foliowyrm"""	"I thought this was without a doubt the best Sci-Fi movie of 2005.  If you missed it while it was in theaters shame on you!  For those who don't know, this film is based on the well made but short lived FOX series ""Firefly.""The movie centers on a band of misfits leaving on the edge of society and the law: There is the ship's captain Malcolm Reynolds, who was a soldier on the losing end of a civil war;  His comrade and first mate Zoey and her pilot husband Wash; The Shepherd (preacher) Book who has a mysterious past;  The beautiful Companion Inara, the untrustworthy mercenary Jayne, the ship's doctor Simon and his gifted and disturbed sister River round out the crew.  When River's past catches up with the crew, they are pitted against a nameless, relentless and implacable enemy in the form of the Operative, a agent of the Alliance government whose only mission is to kill River whatever it takes. This leads them over the edge of society and they are forced to find and confront the secret that River holds, and that may be more dangerous than the Operative.If you have not seen the Firefly series and are a Sci Fi fan, you will enjoy this movie.  If you are already aquainted with the Firefly 'verse, you will probably love this movie.  The special features are also above average, especially the audio commentary by Joss Whedon.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3	Brian Reaves	This is one incredible movie. No, you don't have to be familiar with the series to enjoy it, but the familiarity will make several moments in the movie that much more tragic. The action here is incredible, and unlike several of the Star Trek movies, the characters don't deviate from their series personnas. The emotional impact of several scenes is so intense it was hard to stay seated (a crash landing sequence can almost give you motion sickness). This brings a satisfying end to the storyline the original series had started. It's a shame the show never got to tell this story in its entirety. You can see where some parts of the movie are rushed in a way. Something that could have been stretched over weeks in a series had to be handled in minutes, and that robs it a little. But you have to applaud Whedon for being able to tie up all the loose ends he started with just two hours. Shame on the network for cancelling this, but congratulations to Whedon for giving the fans--both old and new--the ending the show deserved. Heroes will shine, and some will fall, but Serenity will live on.Now bring the show back!	5.0	Even better than the series	2005-09-30	1393	1314	79
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3KR0O1KV0TXBO	Brian Silberberg	Firefly was a show that I am proud to call my favorite television show of all time despite the fact that only fourteen episodes exist. The show is my favorite because of the ideas behind it, a sci-fi western filled with clever dialouge, lovable characters and episodes with plots that were highly original. Serenity takes some risks by ditching some of the things that made the show great, like the entire western feel of the show is almost entirely blotted out of the film. Why? Because the movie doesn't focus on the frontier planets like the show did, instead it goes deeper into the sci-fi vein, space-fights, big explosions and spaceship chasing. Don't fret though the use of sci-fi in the movie is perfect, it focuses on the shadowy high tech government of the Allaince so it all feels in place. Also, in a bit of irony the only thing I found truly western plot-wise in the picture were the Reavers, who never really appeared on the show. Reavers are in a very basic sense (and probably inspired by) native american scalpers. Anyway, the movie is great and it is a sci-fi movie for the ages.	5.0	Different but equal to the show	2006-07-06	5	4	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1HG2DOSBZEX4I	Bryan A. Pfleeger	In the short lived Fox TV series Firefly Joss Whedon created an interesting new world 500 years in the future that was a mixture of outer space adventure and the post Civil War old West. He peopled this world with an interesting group of misfits who somehow became a family by Episode 14. In Serenity much of the family atmosphere disappears and we are left with a medium budget action film. This is not necessarily bad just different.The film starts about six months after the close of the series. River Tam (Summer Glau) has been broken out of a Government facility by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River has unwittingly been turned into a weapon by the government but more frightenly she harbors a secret that has the potential to weaken the govenment itself. An assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is sent to find her and bring her back at all costs.Without spoilers that is the premise of the film. The characters are all ther from the show but they have changed in the time between the show's cancellation and the film's release. The Captain (Nathan Fillion) has become darker and more withdrawn. I think that his character is now closer to Whedon's original vision of him in the pilot episode. Other characters are not used as much as some of the fans may have wished but this is a limited run time film with nine main characters.Whedon keeps the film running smoothly for its entire run time and the film looks more epic than the TV show ever could. As a side note the cinematography of Jack Green looks fantastic even though I enjoyed the work of David Boyd on the television show a little more with its rougher edged look. The music is now by David Newman and ids much more thematic than that of Greg Edmonson.I watched the two disc Collector's Edition. The picture and sound were almost perfect. There are two commentary tracks: one featuring the cast which is more anecdotal and a more technical commentary by Whedon himself. Also available are numerous featurettes; some outtakes and deleted and extended scenes.This may be one that appeals more to fans of the original series but the film stands on its own quite well. By all means see it.	4.0	Much Darker Than Firefly	2008-04-13	2	1	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1M7HM3P4NRLHA	Bryan S. Sampsel	"Joss said it well, both through his characters and personally, ""We did the impossible, that makes us mighty.""FOX Television, in a short sighted attempt to cash in on a low budget cop show and reality TV, cut short two great television shows: Firefly and John Doe.Firefly was a post US Civil War western, set in a Sci-Fi backdrop.  By backdrop, I mean that the technology wasn't the story, it was merely a support aspect of the story.  There was no bouncing an energy beam off the deflector dish to save the day or slingshotting your space craft around the sun to travel in time.  The Sci-Fi was as comfortably placed in the world of Serenity / Firefly as your microwave oven is in real life.Serenity came about because Joss, the cast and crew, and the fans would not let such a special story die.The movie allowed Joss to write a deeper story than he could have within the limits of a television series.  Serenity is deeper, darker, and more emotionally impacting than even Firefly was.Even the villian has a good reason for being a villian.  He's not two dimensional.  The character was well written and well performed.  You couldn't help but to admire and hate the guy in one thought.The hero, Captain Mal Reynolds, had to learn a lesson.  He had to regain his faith.  In the series, we learned that he lost his hope and faith after losing the war for freedom from oppression.The Firefly/Serenity story is one of individual struggle, freedom, and life.  It just happens to be set 500 years in the future and in a different solar system."	5.0	We did the impossible, that makes us mighty	2006-05-04	8	6	2

There's no question that that kind of stuff can cause an adrenaline rush, and be entertaining. From my perspective, however, that's all there was, a handful of folks on a beat up space ship trying to escape with a fugitive from the home planet. Dense as I am, I wasn't sure why the dude chasing our heroes wanted the wisp of a 17 year old girl that they were ferrying around the universe. Of course she did provide some of the excitement what with her copying scenes from Matrix where she fights a large crowd of drooling maniacs and lays them all out on the ground dead or dying.There really is no depth to this movie. It's just a space opera. If you are satisfied with that well then you can give it five stars, but it wasn't enough for me.One thing that puzzled me. When we see the crew walking around the space ship you see all sorts of loose equipment and furnishings. Then when you see the outside of the ship while it is taking off you see it going through an amazing number of spins and loops. I can't help but visualize people and objects being tossed all over the place on the inside. Makes for a fun mental image.	2.0	Two Hour Long Chase Scene	2007-08-20	22	5	17

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A13JMAE32IK34J	c0rwyn	Joss Whedon creates a masterpiece in Serenity. With Whedon it is all about the characters. And you can't help but care about the crew of Serenity.  They are the underdogs in the story and they are so likable you can't help but root for them.The movie does well to explain where main thread of the story comes from, but to really appreciate it you need to see the original series 'FireFly'.The movie has a lot of drama, action, humor... everything you could want in a story.  But the real reason to appreciate it is that the characters have a sense of what is right. And they are willing to give up everything; including their lives for 'what is right'.My only complaint with the DVD is the extras:  They show deleted scenes, and after watching them you can tell why they were deleted.  They should have left the 'bonus' material off the DVD release. It just lets you know that the editors did their job.	5.0	Masterfull storytelling	2005-12-20	8	7	1

No one.  When I heard about Serenity I was both happy and sad since my hopes that a move response would bring the show or at least another movie back.  I didn't think the response from fans would be overwhelming enough.Well the Movie by far was above my expectations.  It was sad to see Shepherd go, I think the Ron Glass comeback was great!  But, again, well written and if indeed this is the last of this great creation, Joss did a hell of a job making his lasting mark.

After reading all the great reviews I was sure I would like this movie, but now I am wondering if I watched the same movie that everyone else did......The movie was full of cliches, the scenes were disjointed and hard to follow sometimes, I had a hard time hearing some of the actors deliver their lines because it sounded like they were mumbling or talking too fast to end the scene, and despite all the action scenes I was bored. Worst of all I felt no attachment to the characters whatsoever. A good movie is one where you WANT the characters to survive, not one where you just hope they all die so the movie will be over. That brings me to River....she was very irritating. She was slack jawed and emotionless to the point where you wanted to check her for a pulse. The captain was a cold and unlikable character (especially when he threatened to shoot his crew). I actually felt myself rooting for the bad guy in this one because he was the only good actor. Frankly, I think this film is a insult to the viewer's intelligence. It seems as though the writer thought he could get away with his weak characters and storyline if he threw in enough action scenes. Or maybe he just didn't try to write a good movie because he was counting on die hard fans of the series to watch this no matter how bad it was. It seems as though there is such a lack of good science fiction movies lately that people will like anything with a flying ship in it.So please people, stop giving this movie four and five stars. Its simple, if we stop watching crap like this hollywood will be forced to make a GOOD sci-fi movie.	2.0	Stop giving this movie five stars!	2006-03-19	40	8	32
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A26YIKWYQ3U5Y7	Calvin Ng	"Joss Whedon is a god when it comes to story writing and character development.  Serenity like all his other works does not disappoint.  With all the action and visual splendor that the movie entices viewers with, the true essence of the film lies with its characters.  The world that Whedon beautifully illustrates is one that speaks of truth and companionship.  In a not so distant chinese/western-esqe world, in the end, its the people that are around us that make what we fight for everyday worthwhile.  This is no ""star wars"" epic, nor does it need to be.  The movie allows first time followers of this world to be quickly drawn in without dragging it out for those longtime faithful.  The extra dvd features are great as well, but honestly, buy this dvd and realize what TRUE writing and film making are all about.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2AR6DYT5L8XPW	CamS	Serenity is a brilliant film. Moving, funny, and just the right amount of action, it's a genuinely powerful sci-fi film. Problem is, if you haven't seen Firefly, you may well not get it.Look around, and you'll see that virtually all of the negative reviews come from those who have not seen Firefly. What does this say to you? The fact is, despite having one of the most human stories I've seen, Firefly holds a universe that takes some getting used to. Horses and spaceships, sporadic usage of Chinese, etc. etc. - and yet Firefly explains it all perfectly. It's all gold. See the series, then the movie. Unless you just don't like sci-fi as a rule, you will love it.	5.0	See Firefly first.	2006-06-10	5	4	1

I bought Serenity and watched it.  Then I watched it again.  Every time I watched it I loved it more and more.  This film is amazing!  The cast is great, the story is great!  I then discovered there was an original series called Firefly so I just had to have it.  Gotta say I love the series more than the film and can't understand why it was cancelled.  Once again those morons at the Sci-fi channel have killed off what is a superb program (just like they did with SG-1).  I really hope that in the near future Joss Whedon (a genius) will find a backer that wants to bring back Firefly.  It has the fans, it has the demand.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3536O3S8N11VU	Carlos Teran	America (and most of the world) has a romance with the ones who lose, the underdogs, the fighters of lost causes with a true merit of their own. Firefly was a very short-lived TV series that was based on one basic premise: the world in the future, will be just about the same, but with fancier technology. The show was well-written, with inteligent (but somewhat naive) plots and very decent visual effects. Firefly wasn't a big-names show, as for most of the actors, this was their really big break... and they got cancelled. So again, the underdog motif is lingering around.Let pass some years. Firefly has a huge fan-base that rivals that one of Star Trek and Star Wars. In some ways, even more dedicated, because just a season isn't much to brag about and they had to build their own fandom around the Firefly universe and mythos. So, the dedication of those fans and Josh Whedon (a true underdog by all means) gave birth to Serenity, about the only movie based on a cancelled TV series, not made with footage pieces of the series. Raw, new material for the browncoats around the world.The spawn of such devotion is a true quality product. Good acting, an intelligent script (in some poetic ways, above average for a Sci-Fi movie) and better visual effects than the actual TV show (created by Zoic, of Battlestar Galactica and Children Of Dune fame). Unlike many Star Trek movies (and I'm myself an avid ST fan), Serenity doesn't feel like a feature-lenght episode at all. About the only flaw that can be found in this product is that it needs an in-depth knowledge of the TV series. This movie isn't for the casual viewer without a Firefly Boxed Set at hand.Regarding the DVD itself, the extras are less than expected, with the director's commentary about the only pleasant surprise in this DVD. I wonder if a 2 discs set would have been any better than this.It's sad that this movie did not-so-well at the box-office, but that's because the lack of support from the studio and the awful timing for the release. Such as Firefly, it deserved better.My advise would be: buy it. You'll get an excellent story, packed with action and stunning visuals. You won't regret it. Nuture the browncoat inside you... because, in the end... we're all underdogs.	5.0	The Return Of The Underdog	2006-04-29	10	8	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A269YICH7XF060	Cass Morris	"This movie is, in a word, fantastic. It proves the power of what a fandom can do when the love for a series is strong enough. Serenity keeps all the heart, all the dazzle, all the strength of the Firefly series, while adding the sort of sparkle that a feature film needs. ""Browncoats"" and newcomers alike can enjoy this; I came to it in theatres not knowing anything about the series, but I was instantly captivated. One can only hope that interest in Serenity will revive faith in Whedon and demand for the story in some form.The story itself is wildly entertaining. Whedon drops the viewer into a world that is ours. For all it's set five hundred years in the future, it's still just people, it's still all the fancies and foibles of life. He creates a true ""space western"" with the sort of energy and liveliness not seen since the original Star Wars trilogy - and he does it with better dialogue, and less focus on flashy special effects. Each character is engaging; every member of the Serenity crew is someone you want to know personally. You want to sign on with Captain Reynolds and throw yourself into danger with him and the rest of the crew. The dialogue is very natural, and unexpected. Whedon makes you think he's going to use typical sci-fi conventions, and then shatters them entirely, undercutting the tension with a quick quip, or having a typically flippant character say something profound without losing his mannerisms. But most of all, the movie makes you feel. You connect, you love... you ache for more when it's over.The special features, incidentally, are also delightful. I'm not someone who usually spends hours watching bonus features on DVDs, but I sat straight through all of these. The deleted scenes are treasures, and Whedon's commentary on them is fascinating, and all of the featurettes showing Whedon and the cast and crew are so heartfelt and so entertaining. Definitely worth watching, just as Whedon's commentary is worth listening to."	5.0	Everything's shiny.	2005-12-25	17	17	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3JM17QHAJCOWD	Catherine Gallanti	"After a quite confusing beginning (I had not seen the firefly series), I eventually got into this movie and really enjoyed it. Good sci-fi is hard to come by: the scince has to be plausible, the fiction has to be fascinating and it has to somehow make sense as a possible future or alternative reality. So much science fiction falls short in one fo these three categories, but ""Serenity"" succeeds on all levels. The cosmology is credible, the story is gripping and the carachters are very enjoyable. It also leaves the door wide open for a sequel, as it seems obvious that there are more adventures to be had in the world of the Alliance, with its many planets and many moons. If there is a sequel I will be first in the queue to see it.Good gripping sci-fi. Well done."	4.0	Very good movie	2005-12-23	10	9	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AYBGNQB3ACVHM	Cathy	I watched the series on the Sci-Fi channel long after downloading the episodes from the web.  I liked the 12 original episodes so much I kept hoping for more to come until my husband informed me the show had long been cancelled, but Whedon (the writer/director) had made a movie in hopes of garnishing more followers, etc.  When the movie came out, it was one that I went to see and was left waiting to see if a sequel would be made.  That's how great this movie is.Interesting notes:-  The movie picks up essentially where the T.V. episodes left off.-  Characters are believable and all actors are superb in playing them.-  Many twists to the movie leaving you on the edge of your seat and one particular one leaving your mouth-left-wide-open from disbelief!This is a movie that can be highly enjoyed by non-Sci-Fi fans but I do suggest seeing the 12 episodes prior to viewing the movie in order to have a background and understanding of the characters and the over-all essence of how this world lives unlike other science fiction films of today and in the past.	5.0	Wishing for a sequel ...	2006-07-13	4	3	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1N00127IDBHD6	CConn	"Please note, this review's wording and tone may seem a bit odd as, originally, it wasn't a review at all - but a post on at popular movie discussion board. But, after writing the analysis, I realized it basically expressed my feelings about the movie equal or better than any review could, so without further delay, here is my review/analysis of Serenity...Reasons why you should like Serenity...1). The cast. They are, in short, fantastic. Not particularly because of acting ability alone - though I'm not saying they're bad actors - but chemistry. They fit with each other, and play off each other, SO well you just literally fall in love with all of them. I harken their chemistry to the original Star Wars cast's; they fit so well together, you really begin to care about them, and it all seems so believable.2). The dialogue. Okay, I'll say it; Whedon writes campy, corny dialogue. BUT! who says campy and corny is bad if done well? Whedon does it well, and it shows. Plenty of memorable quotes, plenty of fun lines that have you chuckling in even the most dire of scenes, it's just excellent, I think.3). The universe Whedon has created is, at least, creative - and may even be even magnificent if not for some failings (see; reasons you shouldn't like this movie #2). The merging of cultures and customs is very interesting, and believable, and the whole Han Solo meets Wild Wild West in China is really unique and likeable.4). The action and special effects are quite good. It's not World of the Worlds of King Kong, but it's very strong for a film of this budget and scale, and despite, again, a few failings (see; reasons you shouldn't like this movie #2...and a lil bit o' #1), it's very entertaining.And as an added bonus, reasons why you SHOULDN'T like the movie...1). The plot. It's very, very...blah. A problem that I had with the show continues in the film; all they do is run. They run to this planet, they run to that planet. They're running from this person, they're running from that person. After a while it becomes quite boring and monotonous.2). The sorta ""cheap"" feel of it all. Again, this is a problem I had with both Buffy and Firefly; Whedon doesn't seem to know how to make things look...good, or ""rich"" at least. Everything seems to sorta have this ""made for TV"" quality to it. From dim lighting to set design, it all didn't seem very much like a feature film, or for that matter, real.3). A mediocre villain. That's right; Serenity has one. While I'm sure Chiwetel Ejiofor did his very best playing the intimidating and power ""Operative,"" he just didn't really seem to have the presence all true great villains have; that Darth Vader-like dread you feel whenever he walks into a shot - that just wasn't there, sadly. He is a fair villain, I mean, he goes through all the motions well, and does what he has to do, but The Operative simply isn't a great villain, and while this doesn't necessarily hurt the film, it certainly doesn't help it.Overall, however, I do think the positives outweigh the negatives by quite a good margin - and Serenity is quite a good film. I think the most important thing though - in watching any movie - is don't go in with sky high expectations, don't go in with your head full of things these crazy Whedon worshippers are saying, go in hoping for an enjoyable film. And, hopefully, you will enjoy it, and with luck, you'll come out having seen a film that you, dare I say, love.Personally, I didn't ""love"" it, but still, it gets a solid 4.5/5 from me."	5.0	Serenity: box office failure, creative success	2006-02-14	7	5	2

I used to HAVE to watch Star Trek for Science homework every Friday night when I was in 8th grade (1967-68). Now we really have tablets, cell phones, etc. I have no desire to be a Companion, but it is interesting to see how Joss (does his first name mean ""luck"" or ""fate"" in Chinese?) Whedon has thrown the Chinese language, some costumes and decor into the mix -- almost as if he knew 10 yrs ago what will happen to our economy unless we wake up. Notice how all the characters speak Chinese as their second language regardless of their first? The Chinese laugh at our purchase-based economy NOW. Please don't give them enough to laugh about ten more years from now, otherwise we'll ALL be demanding to be taken out to the black and they can burn the land and boil the sea.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2S02XWWNNHUIX	C. E. Miles	"I must respectfully disagree with some of my fellow reviewers and say that you do not under any circumstance need to have seen the short lived television series `Firefly' to enjoy, or understand its feature film continuation `Serenity'. I was never a huge fan of `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' but I had always heard great things about all of the Joss Whedon penned series, and since `Firefly' was canceled so quickly I never got a chance to sample it either. However, when I signed up for one of the on-line video rental services, I added `Serenity' to my queue. It arrived, and with little expectation I popped it in the old DVD player and sat down for what I thought would be your typical run of the mill sci-fi / action movie. I was hooked from the opening sequence, and decided by the time the movie was over that I had to own it. Not only do I own my own DVD copy, I also stop to watch it every time it shows up on cable. Obviously, I don't expect you to enjoy it as much as I did, but please don't be scared off by the sci-fi premise. It is not a typical CGI, special effects laden movie, this is a rarity in Hollywood these days; an actual story, with deep, meaningful characters that you really care about.Serenity is the name of a decaying freighter, home to Captain Malcolm (Mal) Reynolds and his peculiar crew comprised of a faithful soldier, her pilot husband, a mechanic, a ruthless mercenary, a doctor and his traumatized sister, one of whom carries a secret that will cost them all dearly. As the Captain and crew attempt to avoid detection from the oppressive government know as the Alliance, a government agent known only as an Operative has been dispatched to recover this secret or cover it up, and he will stop at nothing to complete his mission. A deadly game of cat and mouse between the wily Captain Reynolds and the dangerous Operative ensues, and soon many innocent lives hang in the balance.What really makes this movie unique is not only the first rate dialog (a Joss Whedon staple), but a plot that never becomes predictable. As the antihero, Captain Reynolds (played wonderfully by Nathan Fillion) seldom does anything you expect him to do, but always manages to make things interesting.As I said earlier, I had never seen the television show that inspired the motion picture, but after seeing `Serenity' multiple times, I did purchase the entire `Firefly"" series, which I enjoyed as much if not even more than I did the movie. If you are an action/adventure fan I really think you will like this movie, and if you are even a fringe sci-fi fan, this is one you will want to check out. My wife, my 19 year old daughter, and my 7 year old son all loved this movie; I am guessing you will too."	4.0	A really good movie, don't overlook it.	2006-12-29	3	3	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ARM4M0ZVOF3MN	C. Eschweiler	"So yes...the subject line gives away my entire review: I love this movie. And deservedly so.  I grew up in a time that coined the words ""hyperspace,"" ""The Force"" and ""transporter room.""  Yet with all the groundbreaking Sci-Fi television and film, no movie has drawn my in like Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" and the series that spawned it, ""Firefly.""The tale of just how this movie came to be is a gripping rollercoaster tale in itself, but the tales within are where the magic really happens.And that's one of the charms of this movie - it does't shore up the story with mystic contrivances or delusions of evolved sensibilities.  It's a story of just folk in an unjust and unexpected situation.  It's more Route 66 than it is the Long Island Expressway.  And yet every new locale in the movie supports the story.  Some Sci-Fi takes us places that are so magnificent that you want to pause the movie and just take in the sights.  And while Serenity has some of that, too, the urge to stay and sightsee pales to the urge to see what's next for the characters.As for the Collector's Edition, you get to glimpse the exitement and loyalty that Captain Reynolds and his crew have generated.  From behind the scenes to stars quite literally singing the praises of their on-screen personas, this is a worthy addition to the collection of those who like a good yarn that rings true."	5.0	Best Sci-Fi Film I've Seen	2007-10-06	2	2	0

It is the feature film that was made to tie-up the prematurely cancelled show.  The movie delivers on every level.  It is a great story and includes all of the original main characters.  Great action and a satisfying conclusion to the series.  It can be watched as a &#34;stand-alone,&#34; but viewers will get so much more out of the film by watching the Firefly series first.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3F6O9EE6JOTH1	Chad E. Munn	I missed Firefly when it was on TV. A sad fact that I didn't understand until I saw it on DVD about a year too late. It took NO time for Firefly to become my absolute- unquestionable- favorite TV show of all time. This movie was an answered prayer. And honestly- anyone who has NO attachment to this series or this director - this was the BEST MOVIE I saw all year long. It was the best movie experience I've had since Fifth Element.The characters are the best ever witnessed. Seriously. You will believe that somewhere in the 'verse- these people are on a spaceship, fending off whatever evil tails 'em. The dialogue is so gripping and so quick-n-clever that you will love each and every line. The chemistry between the crew members and the script is perfection. Forget anything you think Sci-Fi is about, then watch Serenity. It will change your views on what you expect from movies, from Sci-Fi and from entertainment in general. Absolutely Brilliant. A MUST own for any movie fan, of any genre.Bottom line- if you call yourself a fan of Sci-Fi and you don't own this on Blu Ray- stop calling yourself a fan of Sci-Fi. Blu Ray was made for Serenity.	5.0	An almost too good of a movie for an impossibly too good show	2005-11-20	9	8	1

The crew of the Serenity get the send off they deserve and everything falls into place.  I must admit however that when I first heard of Firefly, it was from this movie.  I didn't get into the show itself until much later and I have felt like a total idiot ever since for not jumping on the 'mule' while it was still movin'.  In all seriousness, I'm with the legion of fans in that this should have lasted a Hell of a lot longer than it did but I won't repeat an already worn out argument that won't change nothin' anyway lol.And if anyone's curious, Browncoat all the way!	5.0	Joss Whedon and his BDM	2013-05-29	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AIB7NOXYIPW5S	"Charles F. Brand III ""etdweasel"""	"Do you remember the first time you saw ""Star Wars?"" How'd you feel afterwards? Like George Lucas had been following you around, making notes about what you read, what you watched, what you loved? Like he'd interviewed your friends, your relatives, checked with Santa about your Christmas wish lists? Do you remember how many people you dragged back to the theatre, over and over, converting all your friends like some demented Jedi missionary? Do you remember how you waited for ""Return of the Jedi"", how you wrote letters about how it shouldn't be named ""Revenge of the Jedi"" and you stood in line for tickets for 3 days? How long's it been since you felt that way? Yeah, you're in your 40's now, you've got a 40-hour-a-week job that you spend 70 hours a week doin', your wife wants you to wallpaper the bathroom, your kids are away at college buying I-Pods with their book money, it just cost you $70 to have your dog's teeth cleaned and all you wanna do is feel like you did back then.Well, this is your lucky day, my friend; you have a chance to relive that experience. Joss Whedon has brought you an early Christmas present called ""Serenity."" You've heard of Joss; ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Angel"" and a little series on Fox called ""Firefly."" That last was a special kind of show; great writing, a tight cast, a haunting score and a story line that made all the other sc-fi you'd seen lately seem like episodes of ""Meet the Press."" Fox did their best to kill it; they refused to show the pilot, they showed episodes out of order, they pre-empted it and then abandoned it with 3 episodes left unaired. Like 40 or 50 other Fox shows in recent years, it was dead.But it wasn't dead. The fans, Browncoats, as they call themselves, immediately started writing letters, making phone calls, posting messages on sc-fi web sites and blogs, all in an effort to save the show. That, and Joss wouldn't quit. He told the cast they were cancelled and, almost in the same breath, told them not to give up, that he'd find them a home. Together they made enough noise that Fox decided to release the series on DVD, figuring that'd shut the fans up and they could go back to putting quality shows on the air like ""The Simple Life."" But, then, DVD sales just took off. Word spread, mostly fan to fan. People began having DVD viewing parties, buying DVDs for friends, setting up booths at sci-fi conventions to promote the show and the DVDs with no help from Fox. You see, they loved the show and it's characters and the folks who gave them life so much that they were willing to do the promotion Fox wouldn't spring for. And, they made enough noise (and bought enough DVDs) that they got the attention of Universal Studios who, perhaps remembering Star Trek and the above mentioned Star Wars, decided to spring $40,000,000 for a movie.It was money well spent. ""Serenity"" is everything the series and the above mentioned franchises were, and much more. Mr. Whedon, being simply the most eloquent script writer on the planet, has given the film a story line that not only satisfies (at least, temporarily) the Fireflyistas, it's a knock down, kick butt film in it's own right.The plot: Five hundred years in the future, Earth has become uninhabitable, and the human race has moved on to a new solar system made up of dozens of terraformed planets. There is a bloody civil war between the government of the inner core of planets, known as the Alliance, and a rag-tag collaboration of independents, who populated the outer planets and call themselves Browncoats. The Alliance, of course, prevails. A few years later Malcom Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a veteran of the losing side, scrapes by as the captain of a Firefly-class ship, Serenity, named after the location of the battle which ended the war. With a crew comprised of the only other survivor of Reynolds' platoon, Zoe (Gina Torres), a wise cracking pilot and Zoe's husband, Wash (Alan Tudyk), a young tomboy mechanic, Kaylee (Jewel Staite) and a mercenary who would sell out his mother to the highest bidder, Jayne (Adam Baldwin), Mal takes any job, legal or not, particularly if he can stick it to the Alliance in the process. When they take on two passengers, a young doctor and his sister, they get more than they bargained for. The doctor, Simon (Sean Maher), rescued his sister, River (Summer Glau), a psychic, from an Alliance research facility where she was the subject of experiments aimed toward...well, we're still not quite sure. River, still recovering from her experience, is being pursued by a ruthless Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), sent by the Alliance to retrieve their ""property"".In the hands of another writer or director this could easily have deteriorated into one of those horrible, clich&eacute;d Sci-Fi Channel movie-of-the-week monstrosities (You know, the ones that always seem to star David Keith or the latest hunk from some WB network teen drama) or a low budget throwaway designed to ride the coat tails of the latest chapter of the ""Star Wars"" franchise (Think ""Spacehunter: Adventures In The Forbidden Zone""). But an excellent script and a cast that have to rely on talent rather than name recognition make this movie so much more than the sum of it's parts. The film is built on story and subtle attention to detail, it doesn't rely on over-the-top special effects or unstoppable blood-sucking aliens. (In Joss's vision of the future, the monsters are all too human.)It's to Mr. Whedon's credit that this film is able to stand on it's own as a truly great example of the genre, not just as an addendum to an abandoned television series. See it now. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer, you'll tell your friends and drag 'em to the theatre and wait in line three days for the sequel. You'll regain your youth. And the next coat you buy just might be a bit brown..."	5.0	Remember the first time you saw Star Wars?	2005-10-06	13	10	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AA6AJD8VKAMIC	Charles H. Martin	The amazing thing about Serenity is how seamlessly Joss Whedon manages to move from the television series to the movie. While a few minor (and easily explainable) changes have taken place since the end of Firefly, fans of the canceled-before-its-time TV series will not miss a beat. There is no long-winded opening or introduction to the 'Verse. The movie just starts as though it were a natural continuation of the TV series.At the same time, there is just enough of an introduction for newcomers to understand what is going on. In a few quick minutes, all the background needed to enjoy the movieis revealed. The combination of old west and space opera fits smoothly and the adventure is off and running before you know it.The movie has everything you need in a science fiction action adventure. It has some terrific action sequences, character development that benefits from the actors knowing each other and their characters for an entire TV season, and some insight into the human situation as well. I will warn fans of the TV series that some of your favorite characters will be killed. I won't say who, but do realize this: no one is safe.If you're a fan of the TV series, this is a must have movie. If you're a newcomer, this is the sci-fi action movie that all the other theatrical releases of 2005 such as Star Wars and War of the Worlds failed to be. Buy the DVD, and there might just be more.Hey, it worked for Firefly...	5.0	Flawless.	2006-01-11	8	8	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT	Charlie Brooks	Serenity is billed as a stand-alone movie, but it is really a conclusion of the television series Firefly, which met with premature cancellation thanks to some bad decision making by Fox. The film reintroduces the characters from the series and ties up several of the loose ends that were left at the end of the last episode, specifically the troubled psychic River and her flight from the Alliance.If you've watched and enjoyed the TV series, then Serenity is for you. The movie has the same interesting characters, wonderful universe, and mix of tragedy and humor that appealed to television audiences. I will warn you that this is a conclusion -- a farewell to the Firefly Universe -- and therefore has a sense of finality and change to it. Be prepared to face some real tragedies and tough moments as these characters finish the adventure of their lives.The film is somewhat accessible to people who aren't familiar with the TV series, but it does have its flaws to a fresh audience. The characters are very detailed, but only the surface gets scratched in this movie. While Joss Whedon provided enough of a backstory to help newcomers understand what is going on, a lot of the subtleties will be lost on people who didn't see the 13-episode run on television. Additionally, the circumstances that the characters face won't seem as grave to someone who hasn't grown to love the setting.Overall, this film is an excellent sendoff to a series that was canceled before its time. If you didn't watch Firefly, however, I would suggest checking out the DVD box set of that series first. Serenity will mean much more to you if you understand what has happened before the film begins.	4.0	A fine farewell	2009-01-22	0	0	0

Nathan Fillion, in particular, is so expressive and easy on the eyes as well. You really need to see the series before viewing this movie. The movie stands alone but it's not a great movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2679H3JTDDUTL	C. Hoffman	I was initially hesitant to go see this film because of the rabid fan base.  I expected the hype to be overblown.  I read a review by Orson Scott Card (multiple Hugo award winner)  and decided it was a must see.  I have to agree with OSC, it is quite possibly one of the finest Sci Fi films that I have ever seen.This is a film with multiple layers.  Its about people who somehow resemble the people I know.  Some people are driven blindly by ideology.  Others find themselves not driven by right and wrong, but by survival; trying to find control in situations manipulated by outside forces.The action is intense and the fight scenes fantastic.  Humor abounds in the relationships of these characters.  The first minutes of the film are some of the best backstory filling that I've ever seen done.  I didn't need to see the original series to enjoy this film.The only draw back was that initally the speech patterns took some getting used to.  After I was used to the cadence of their lingo, I found it charming.	4.0	A surprising jewel after many lackluster Sci Fi films.	2005-10-25	11	10	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A313OOPDU3E1Q3	"Christopher Fowler ""ninja rabbit"""	This is by far the best sci fi I've seen in quite a while.  It definely has some messages, but that adds to storyline rather than detracts from it.  Whedon doesn't try and beat you over the head with his viewpoint, in other words.  Great storyline, and both myself and my wife feel that the movie does a good job of banishing the 'pretty boy' main characters so often seen in cinema now.  The recycling of big name movie stars is getting old, hollywood.In rebuttal to Mr. Lambert's review, I will say this: the reavers WERE dirty people with torn clothes.  Did you not watch the movie?  Yes its all great to have the bad guys costing around 10,000+ dollars a piece for costume and wardrobe in a sci-fi film, but that wasn't the plot, was it?  Whedon did a more than excellent job with the budget he was given.  I would have liked more closeup shots of the 'monster characters' and their ships,  but given the budget that may have detracted from the movie more than added to it.  As it is, the quick running glances we see of the reavers allowed for you not to notice any flaws.Thanks for reading, this film is a must see for sci-fi fans or movie goers alike.  I rented it, and now plan to buy this movie and quite possibly the series.  This definitely left me both intrigued and wanting more.  I even watched the commentary, which I have only done on one other film: fight club.

I think it's good science fiction, just not great science fiction. If you haven't seen the show Firefly (I've seen bit and pieces) the first half of the movie will probably come off as confusing and a little dopey. I think the last third of the film is a blast. The story is good, though not without problems, and the acting is good. The special effects are fantastic. I don't concider this great science-fiction like Minority Report or Blade Runner, but it will satisfy any genre fans for sure.	4.0	A View from a non-Scifi genre fan.	2006-01-24	6	0	6
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1CYOHNGQ1WED1	Christopher Hivner	"Serenity is an excellent example of a movie done the right way. An imaginative idea, a well written script with a mix of action, emotion and humor and a good cast to carry it all off.Serenity is the name of a ship with a crew of semi-outlaws who have been protecting a doctor and his young sister River who is telepathic and has been severely damaged psychologically by the Alliance as they used behavior modification to turn her into a weapon. The crew is about to let her and her brother behind because they have become a hindrance, when they get a look at what she can do. She is subliminally induced into another state and proceeds to beat the living crap out of a room full of men in a bar. Before going into her fighting state she said the word ""Miranda"". They find out Miranda is a planet and decide they must go there and discover the secret behind what the Alliance is doing. To do this they must get through the Reavers, humans that have gone mad and become cannibals. Add to this an assassin from the Alliance who is tracking them to get the girl back to continue their experiments on her.Serenity is exciting, funny and beautiful to look at. It takes little time for the movie to draw you into its world and have you care about the crew and what happens to them. The special effects are excellent and the fight scene between River and the Reavers is worth the price of admission alone."	5.0	"""I'll kill a man if it's in a fair fight . . . or if a woman is involved . . . or money . . .or if they tick me off . . ."""	2006-01-18	3	2	1

I remembered watching this movie and saying to myself wow this movie is great how was this not a bigger hit.  The movie is based on the Fox TV show, Firefly (which is equally great).  Serenity comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, who is the mastermind behind Marvels ""The Avengers"", Dollhouse, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The movie features Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, and Adam Baldwin.  The movie has a great cast and writing is also great, which is to be expected from a Joss Whedon movie.  The visual effect are first class and the movie in my opinion is great from beginning to end.  Once you see this movie will be a big fan and it will make you want to watch all of Joss's other projects.I enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review."	5.0	Serenity is a great movie that you will want to watch over and over again.	2013-12-01	0	0	0

Who is that amazonian woman on the cover?!?  It is surely not River.  I assume Univeral is trying to draw more attention to the release with the flashy art, but the original movie poster art was far superior.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3TTKMUH9REXNH	"Christopher Perry ""Azazel2099"""	"Firefly is a geat show. Serenity is a fitting and awesome conclusion to this story. 1st the characters/actors are awesome. Each actor has had or currently owns a major role in a television/movie. Nathon Fillion is the main character he is currently on the show Castle. Kalee, Jewel Staite, was also on the show Stargate Atlantis for a awhile. Also, lets not forget Joss Whedon himself, if you liked the new Avenger's movie then you should like this show for they are both his work. My point is the cast is strong, so the comments on bad writing and acting is unfounded. As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage. Lastly, after this show was cancelled, unjustly, this show had a ""HUGE"" fan base. So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did. The Full length film finishing the Firefly series is called ""Serenity"" and currently holds a 4 1/2 star rating here on Amazon out of 1800 + reviews and was rated a 7.9 on IMDB out of 143,000 people.Let me explain the Western aspect and the Chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument. Joss Whedon doesn't just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in Firely has a Chinese and old western style to it. Most of Frefly's fans understand it but for those who don't let me explain...nerd moment beware....In this show Earth is no more or if there are people still on it, its a LOOOONG ways away. The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China. When they settled on their new worlds they formed an Alliance. This is why you see and hear people in Firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking Chinese while still using English as their base language. Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it. Lastly the western feel to the story, Joss Whedon actually explained this in the show better then the Chinese part alot better, you just have to pay attention. In the Pilot episode they clearly state that after the Alliance TERRAFORMS a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies. This is why the show has a Western Feel to it, the inner Alliance Core worlds are the Metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a Sci-fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect. That is the story plot for the western feel to the story. However, I suspect budget played into this part aswell. Almost every TV show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode, so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point. The movie Serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in Firefly and spares no expense when it comes to CGI effects and scenery."	5.0	Fitting End to Firefly!!!	2012-06-10	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1NP91R1CRPNQX	"Christopher R. Travers ""Einhverfr"""	"The movie, ""Serenity"" begins before theFirefly - The Complete Seriesreally gets going, with the rescue of Willow from Alliance scientists.  The movie then picks up after the series was cancelled, providing a satisfying way of picking up loose ends that were left.  We learn, for example, how the Reavers came to be.Like the series, it's not always clear whether the movie is a ""serious"" sci-fi or whether it is a spoof of the ""Space Western"" sub-genre.  The subtext of satire however, is kept as subtext, and the overall movie has a rather serious note, which is as to the nature of human belief, which encompasses religious belief but is broader than that.  What does it mean to believe?  What is the power of belief?  What happens when our beliefs collapse and we are shown we are wrong?In the end, the primary adversary to the crew, a nameless Alliance assassin shows that he has as much nobility and courage of spirit as anyone else, and when confronted with the nature of his own beliefs, makes a surprising turn-about."	5.0	Before and after the series	2010-12-12	1	0	1

The movie is better than the series.....and that says a lot. The movie has the perfect balance of action, drama, comedy, and special effects. It blows the new Star Wars prequals away, and was filmed on probably less than half the budget.One great thing about the movie is how you care for the crew. Throughout the movie you care for the characters. It was a great addition to the Firefly story and I really hope someday that Joss Whedon comes to his senses and makes a second one. I know he said that there aren't any plans to, but there is so much more to be told.

This was a very cool show maybe more like a western than a space opera but pleasant, funny had a very likable cast that meshed well.  Kind of looks like a missed opportunity to keep something first rate on television.  The Serenity Movie does a pretty good job of tying up the television show, has some interesting twists allows the River character to show her chops.  I could go on and touch on the good plot points but why spoil it.  It's not a technical oo-ah tour de force but it's compact, personal, the players work well together. The story idea has some very original ideas in it.  The only down side is that the Shepard and Wash are killed.  The bad guy is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor in a low key dark manner and suits the movie well.  I've watched this several times well worth a look	5.0	Opportunity Lost	2014-06-08	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"There are essentially 3 people that will watch this film: 1) the so-called ""Browncoats"", huge fans of the show Firefly and who probably campaigned to save the show after it was cancelled after 11 of the 14 episodes air. 2)People like me that saw a couple of Firefly episodes but either didn't watch enough to be a fan or are a fan but haven't watched the entire thing and became group number 1. 3) non-fans of anything Firefly related and merely saw it out of trailer interest or store browsing. Well as part of group #2, I can say that it's quite the film although you might be lost on certain things.In the future, Earth became too populated so we branched out. America and China formed to become one big superpower(Amerina? Chirica?) and formed the Alliance featuring other central planets. They also are hunting the Tams, brother/sister duo Simon and River although more specifically River who was engineered to be quite efficient at killing. They both ends up on the ship Serenity.On this ship are quite a crew of characters: captain Mal, husband and wife Wash and Zoe, engineer Kaylee, main muscle Jayne and also returning are preacher Shepherd Book and ""companion"" Inara(she's similar to a geisha I believe, an artisan entertainer rather than a whore). So the entire team is trying to solve the mystery of why the Alliance are after River and also avoiding them and Reavers, primitive people who love to eat/rape people.The first Star Wars trilogy left such a mark on cinema because it had funny moments as well as drama and action. Lately though the recent trilogy has a feeling of ""talk talk talk, action, talk talk talk and by the way look at our awesome effects"". Well Serenity is well-done as it contains many funny dialogue, moments of character and even some well-designed action sequences including an early chase scene in the valley.What might be disorienting to people is the fact that the film assumes people watching Serenity have watched Firefly so they continue on characters where you're like ""whoa, who's he?"" such as when Book shows up. But since the movie was written(and demanded I might add) by the fans, the ""Browncoats"", it's obvious they're didn't need to be any episode recap such as the X-Files film.Compared to special features, this release is a little bare. While I am recommend a purchase, I am most likely thinking there will be a 2 disc edition with a whole bunch of goodies. What we do have though are outtakes, deleted scenes, couple of featurettes and 2 great pieces: a 3 1/2 minute intro with writer/director Joss Whedon who at one point made me laugh ""the film was made for you because you wanted it so if it sucks it's your fault"". Then we have the commentary with him alone who manages to be witty and funny and quite informative at the same time.If you're into Firefly, you'll love it. And like me into general sci-fi you''ll probably love it too."	5.0	Probably one of the best sci-fi action film in recent years	2005-12-20	4	3	1

I purchased the series on dvd about 4 months ago because I'm a Whedon-holic and really do love his ability to create completely realistic characters and I must say, Firefly didn't dissapoint; even for a guy who doesn't really like westerns or science fiction like me.  Serenity was a spectacular movie that complimented the series wonderfully.  I guarantee that if you have even a slight interest in this movie, you will ADORE it!!  Those of you who liked The Fifth Element will definately enjoy this film.  Now, one guy mentioned that if  you watched the series, you'll have a bit more of an understanding to the film and he's right...albeit, please don't let that stop you from watching this film.  Joss Whedon did an incredible job for pleasing fans of the show along with newbies. If, IF, you can, try to watch the series and I guarantee you will see what I'm talking about.  If not, don't worry.  Some of the action sequences left me with my mouth wide open, I mean they were brilliant (the opening really gets you pumped).  This is one of those really rare movies that when I finished watching it, I played it once more.

Strangely, I had never heard of the Firefly series - I simply stumbled across Serenity on HBO one day while channel flipping. I quickly ordered the DVD because I will watch this movie again and again. The characters are immediately engaging, and in an odd way the dialog is very good and added some texture. I was surprised that ""western speak"" worked so well, but kudos to Whedon and his actors for pulling it off.

I wasn't sure if the series could handle a movie, and I usually don't trust movies to be as good as the thing they're based on, but this one was absolutely incredible. Joss Whedon did an excellent job translating his series into a movie.The series was one of my favorite TV shows for the short amount of time it was on. Surprising they took it off considering it was on FOX and FOX likes to put any old garbage on their station. I really think, and I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, that this movie can match up against even Episodes 4-6 of Star Wars. It was so good, I simultaneously want them to make a sequel and dont want them to make a sequel. I want to see more of the Serenity and its crew, but I don't want them to get full of themselves and try to turn it into the next Star Wars. It's fantastic as is.	5.0	The best sci-fi movie I've seen for a long time	2005-12-04	16	15	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3S448I8ZVM3OK	Coleman North	"This is the version of ""Serenity"" that should have been released originally.  As a movie taken on it's own merits, it is a supremely well cast, written and acted ride. To those who followed the ""Firefly"" series however, it's a promise fulfilled and just maybe a ground-breaker for yet another movie based around the series.  The key is the second disc, comprising  commentary from film maker Joss Wheden and members of the cast who not only fill in the sort of detail and background one expects in a disc of ""Bonus Material"", but communicate a love of this film's (and the Firefly series) premise and the unusually vibrant chemistry that manifests itself not only to the spectator, but pretty obviously to all the people involved in the film/show as well.  It is obviously a labor of Love that reaches out to the viewer and if you have the sci-fi bug, pulls you in and engages you on a whole range of levels.  I absolutely recommend buying the Firefly collection AND this collector's edition of Serenity and watching them in that order.  It's like a book you don't want to end, and when it does, you can't wait to start again.  As Joss Wheden says in his commentary...""there's something happening here, and now you're part of it.""

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A39LRLKACX89IP	Courtland J. Carpenter	"I guess movie promotion is a science in itself.  You'd think Universal would have learned the lessons of how this series failed on TV.  Joss is a great storyteller and script writer, but this is twice he's had some marginal clout, and not acted in the interest of his product.  You can't just get caught up in the dreams of the fanbase.  They are by definition, fanatics, it does not always translate into ticket sales.  Now, lets get onto the movie review.First, we need a bit of needed background information for non-fans of the series.  This movie is based on the short-lived, but fantastic tv show, Firefly.  Created by Joss Whedon, of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fame.  He was looking to create a post American civil war type of story, moving the setting into futuristic space.  Sometimes described as a western in space show, it's really a fairly logical speculation on how man would begin to settle, and terra form other planets.  Joss does not believe in ""little green men"" so there are no alien types in his universe, that in itself is  one of the more unique elements, which serve make the series, and movie, something special.I'd heard some disturbing things initially on how they were gonna make this movie. It sounded like they were gonna redo the pilot, so as not to lose viewers who hadn't seen the series.  I think they chose wisely for fans of the series. Unfortunately, I can't help but think they maybe needed a little beginning film narrative.  Perhaps few flashbacks, to bring non-series viewers up to speed. The story line here begins after the series plot arc, and sometime beyond.  Two former crew members (sort of) are staying off ship, each with their own reasons.Joss Whedon must have reviewed the episodes in Firefly, and thought he had a good villain type from the episode ""Objects in Space"".  I really think the main ""bad guy"" in this one was based on the character ""Early"", who matched wits with River, and lost in one of the last episodes shown on TV. Some of the implied violence, killings done by the Alliance, and its chosen henchman, killer, was a bit over the top.  It didn't ring true, because it was not justified.  I think Joss could have done better.  He was looking at a cerebral type of assassin, I don't think mass murder would be ""his"" solution.  Some of the most ""scary"" characters from the series were the black suited men that came after River in the hospital robbery episode.  I think the reprise of those guys, would have had a greater impact to the story.Joss brought a little of Buffy in this movie to the character, River Tam.  Buffy fans, watch for a classic weapon pose, stare, at the end of a long fight scene, which occurs late in the movie. The film has taken some heat over the elimination of some main characters.  This is science fiction, so is anyone really ever dead.  If they need them back there are a number of ways to do it, and I think the deaths were necessary to the story line.  If not for death number one, it would be hard to personalize the killings in the name of finding River.  Later death(s) were abrupt, maybe too much so for fans, but it helped give a sense of reality to the final battles. (Possible Spoiler next)At one point it looked as if any or all of the main cast could die, something that rarely happens in an ensemble cast. You really had the suspicion that Joss might just have believed this movie was a one shot deal, and was going to move on to bigger, better projects! I do like the fact that they got all of the cast involved, in an all too short movie.  This resolved, or at least partially resolved a lot of the loose ends in the series.As a stand alone Science Fiction action movie, with good dialog, story, and action. Its hard to believe this movie didn't manage to pick up some momentum in the theaters. I can only speculate the movie just didn't appeal to movie audiences on some level.  The title may have hurt it, almost as much as the lack of promotion.  Going in a movie like this coming out well after Star Wars III, and War of the Worlds, then six weeks ahead of the latest Harry Potter should have had the movie ticket buyers largely to itself.  It didn't happen.I can't speak for the DVD yet, but I'd buy the wide-screen version, there are many scenes that would lose something without it.  I believe fans will buy this DVD in droves, but if you are a movie fan of good story, good dialog, and even good action, you should buy this film.  In a different time with the right kind of promotion, this film could have launched a new space genre much like Trek or Star Wars.  It is unfair to compare them head to head, but in a lot of ways this is just as good, and often better."	4.0	Terrific Film was largely unnoticed by the general populus in theaters.	2005-11-25	21	18	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"This is a movie I enjoyed a lot more than I expected I would.  Joss Whedon has a thing for telling stories about very small women, girls really, doing really big things.  It is not unlike Buffy in its broad gesture, but very different in its specifics.  Like most space stories it is really a story that would have been a sea story a hundred years ago.  The characters even refer to their spaceship as a boat.  Being a space story of some indefinite time period allows for everything to be more extreme and even disorienting.The broad range of characters from the half-crazed waif, River, and her doctor brother, to the boat's motley crew, through the seemingly invincible ""operative"", to the Reavers themselves there is a lot to notice and enjoy.  Nathan Fillion as the boat's captain does the hero's job quite well while Summer Glau fill's the River role with all the insanity and power the role demands.  Whedon shoots her face at all kinds of very odd angles to play up strangeness and mystery.There are several love interests in the story all of a different kind of love.  We have the husband and wife love between Zoe (weapons officer) and Wash (the great pilot), then the brother and sister devotional love of Simon (the doctor) and River (Glau), and the new romance love developing between Simon and Kayee (Jewell Staite).  And what about the weird relationship between ""Mr. Universe"" (David Krumholtz) and his lovebot?  Of course, there is some kind of relationship between Captain Mal and Inara as well.The payoff of the movie is pretty good, if not particularly subtle.  But I don't expect intellectual stuff from Buffy either.  It is what it is, and that is pretty fun.  Isn't that enough?"	4.0	A lot of fun and much better than I expected	2005-12-30	10	9	1

For those who don't know, Firefly failed miserably because it was aired out of order by Fox, moving the airing days and times around, so it never built an audience. Serenity is the movie to ""wrap up"" what was started in Firefly.It's awful. Firefly was Joss Whedon's dream project, and it was cancelled. Joss Whedon, apparently, threw in the towel and made a movie expressing his crushed dreams instead of a two hour Firefly finale. The characters are changed, (Simon goes undercover...? since when?) to the point of contradicting the TV show, and Joss expresses his emoness over his show being cancelled by killing off two of the main cast. The Reaver plot is decent, and probably would have come out in a Firefly episode, but the rest is awful.

It has Joss Whedon's trademark humor and whip snap jumps from laughter to tears to gasps and edge of the seat exhileration. The first ten minutes pretty much fill you in on all you need to know about the `verse, although certainly a familiarity with the characters from the series Firefly can only enhance your enjoyment.  It does what science fiction does at its best, takes modern issues and ideas and put them in a new context. Truth, belief, freedom, all with a delicious candy coating of space battles and gun fights.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AQCQ5F0OJXMG9	Crystal Starr Light	"You can't really review ""Serenity"" without spending a wee bit of time talking aboutFirefly - The Complete Series.  ""Firefly"" was, in short, an amazing cancelled TV series.  It was a cross between Westerns and Scifi, what I've heard called numerous times ""Han Solo in the Old West"".  You had this cast of characters that was downright superb.  Mal was the captain, bitter from losing a war in Serenity Valley and secretly having feelings for Inara, the on-ship Companion who often uses her esteemed status to get the crew out of capers.  Zoe is his second-in-command, a fairly emotionless woman who doesn't hesitate following orders.  Wash, Zoe's husband, is the pilot, goofy, wise-cracking, and adoring his wife.  Jayne thinks about himself and isn't terribly brilliant.  Kaylee is the sweet mechanic who wants to be ravaged in bed by the attractive doctor, Simon, who in turned left a life of plenty to rescue his sister, River, from being experimented on.  Lastly, we have Shepherd Book, a man of God who is somehow living with these criminals and not abiding in his monastery.Unfortunately, the producers didn't see the magic of ""Firefly"" and canceled the series.  However, Joss Whedon, the man behind this brainchild, was given the chance to catapult his dream onto the big screen--a big deal for a full-fledged series, much, much bigger for a series canceled before finishing its first season.The story of ""Serenity"" is basically tying the loose ends from the TV series.  Simon took River away from a lab where they were turning her into a psychic assassin.  But now, the Parliament has sent a man known only as the Operative after her, to bring her back.  Because River knows secrets...secrets that are about to get the crew of Serenity in very serious trouble.The first time I watched it, I watched ""Serenity"" without seeing the TV series first, and, while I still enjoyed it, it was terribly confusing.  You spend the better part of half the movie trying to catch up.  Then, I purchased ""Firefly"", watched the entire series, and fell in love.  THEN I rewatched ""Serenity"", and found that it makes much more sense.To see the entire cast back is a joy.  And to finally learn what happened to River, what she knew, was great.  But I have quite a few reservations about the movie as a whole.The characters feel...off.  Mal is so grouchy.  Where is his wry humor, glinted at in the beginning with the words ""This is the captain. We have a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then - explode""?  So much of the time, Mal is a brutal, stiff, angry man...nothing like the man we met in ""Firefly"".  He readily brings along River on a job, when in ""Firefly"" he would never have done that, not after the strange things she did.  And his fights with Simon, how he treated Simon and River...it almost seemed as if none of ""Firefly"" had happened.  Simon and River weren't crew to him in ""Serenity""; something that vastly contradicts what he says and does in ""Firefly"".Another sad aspect is Inara.  Besides obviously not being in much of the movie, when she is there, she is delegated action girl and given a gun.  Yes, the stakes are high, but the stakes were high in many of their previous jobs, and never once did she don action girl clothes and tout a gun.  She was in the back, helping Simon nurse the wounded or acting as backup or some other such function (as in the ""Heart of Gold"" episode).  I just felt it violated her crucial role on the team.While the story is absolutely superb, interesting, on the edge of your seat, it disintegrates into a plain 'ol action flick in the last hour.  Lots of Star Wars-y space battles, fist fights, shoot-outs...yes, ""Firefly"" had its fair share of shootouts, but nothing on the scale of ""Serenity"".  I almost felt that they were included, to ""show off"" the film, to draw as many into the seats, wow them, and get them to come back for more.There were a few other aspects I didn't like...but to detail them would probably be huge spoilers.  Let's just say, not everyone makes it out in the end.  And seeing that...makes me very sad indeed (although I understand not everyone can survive).So, there we have it.  The gasping breath of ""Firefly"", the movie ""Serenity"".  I wish it blew my socks off.  Alas, it did not.  Don't get me wrong; I don't hate it.  It's okay to watch, particularly if you have seen ""Firefly"".  Personally, I just hate seeing the characters I've grown to love in ""Firefly"" change so drastically.  Many people apparently didn't have a problem with it.  Maybe I'm just weird.  Regardless, I very sadly give a 3 stars.  Bring back Firefly...the way it should be!Brought to you by:*C.S.

After seeing the movie, I bought the Firefly series; it is a real pity this series didn't stay on TV and things like Stargate and Star Trek did.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3J92SR9I3ZHZ6	CT Resident	Perhaps this is due to the fact that Fox prematurely cancelled the Firefly series, inspiring Joss Whedon and his team to write an epic tale that captures the characters we grew to love in the series.  Not only do the characters backstories become more fleshed out, but they are built into more complex characters through the acting skills that are on display through the duration of the film.  Major drivers of the stories are shown, additionally illuminating why River was so important to the Alliance, and the danger her knowledge poses to their power, as well as some of the mysteries of the universe - including Reavers.

Almost everything got upgraded - the action, the tension, the story, the acting, the character development, the visual/sound effects.Since this was most likely the last you would see of the Serenity's crew on a TV screen, it was appropriate that they had to make it darker. They had to make this last adventure mean something to both the characters and the audience. There will be heartbreak. That being said, it's still not without the humor, the sense of family, the atmosphere that made the TV show such a success even after its cancellation.I still wear my Jayne hat every time I watch an episode or the movie.	5.0	Brilliant	2013-06-27	1	1	0

It was fun, filled with action and adventure - a space western.  The best part was the character development during the course of the series.  Whedon really did a great job of presenting believable characters.Serenity saw a radical shift in the characterization of several characters, to such a degree that it was immediately noticable.  Their behavior during the course of the movie often made little sense to me, given the history established in the TV series.  Even ignoring that I still had difficulty wrapping my brain around the ""why"" of some of their actions.The basic plot, of a corrupt government trying to repress the truth, is the same tired paranoid Sci-FI story that has been reiterated since the birth of the genre.  The only thing that could be considered unique here is the stunning visual effects, costuming, and set design.  The movie is very pretty to look at.The acting is average to bad, with some actors delivering particularly poorly.  This was a sufficient problem for me at times that I could not immerse myself in the tale being woven before my eyes.  I was painfully aware that I was watching an actor poorly deliver lines.The changes made in the backstory to bring the show to the big screen were good and didn't bother me a bit.  I especially enjoyed how the movie opened up the Firefly universe a bit more and filled in some more details.  The wonky nature of a giant planetary system with so many inhabitable worlds bugged the Sci-Fi dork in me, but I doubt it bothered many other folk.  A lot of the realism strived for in the TV show was left behind for fast paced action in this movie.  While i'm sure this was a great move on the part of the developers, it took away some of what I liked most about the series.The over-the-top fight sequences, while neat at first, became tired towards the end of the movie.  How much punishment can these characters take?  The entire end sequence felt forced and purposeless, with a fight that went far beyond the bounds of believability.  Mal seems more like an all powerful super soldier by the end instead of the army grunt he had previously been portrayed as.It's still a good movie, and worth a watch, but like other lower quality Sci-Fi it's not something I feel the need to see again."	3.0	Ok movie that deviated sharply from the original show.	2005-12-14	98	14	84

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A38S7MPDRBLN1T	"Dakota W. Nicolucci ""Crazystan"""	Serenity as most of you know is based off of the short lived, but never forgotten Firefly series written by Joss Whedon (Angel, Buffy). Serenity takes you into a western-sci-fi world that is so imaginative and not revolving around aliens at all! For those of you who haven't seen the show, you will still enjoy it for some great action, intersting story, great characters and some really funny lines. Firefly fans though will get more out of it. It's just the nature of the beast. If you have the chance to see the show, or even a few episodes before you see the movie, the better. The way to story unfolds is very nice and very well paced. Many scenes will have you at the edge of your seat due to great writing and storytelling by Joss Whedon. The movie may not be a non-stop laugh riot, but the humor is used at the exat right times. Right when things look like things are at their worst, one of the characters will say a line that will relieve the tension even just for a bit. After the series of Star Wars prequels that just barely satisfied us Star Wars fans, Serenity comes around and gives you actual characters that you care for. George could learn a thing or two from Joss. The film will no doubt be a cult classic, but hopefully if enough normal people who haven't seen the series go, we just might have a franchise. Please, if you have the chance, go see Serenity. YOu should hopefully be able to pick out something that you will like.~Can't Stop The Signal~	5.0	~Can't Stop The Signal~	2005-10-06	5	4	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AEQFYOI6YJ83Z	DanD	"""Serenity"" is one of the few sci-fi movies that I absolutely loved the first time I saw it.  I knew nothing about the television series ""Firefly"" at the time (though I have subsequently seen several episodes, and love them almost as much as the movie).  I am not a ""cult follower"" of any show/movie/band/author/etc.  ""Serenity,"" however, grabbed my attention right off the bat, for one simple reason: its smooth blend of action and comedy into one tight, well-acted picture.River Tam (Summer Glau) is a troubled teenage girl; troubled in the sense that she's psychic, and has incredible fighting powers.  Her brother Simon (Sean Mahr) has bought both of them a place on Serenity, a starship led by Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion).  However, with a deadly assassin (Chiwetal Ejiofor) in hot pursuit, Mal and his ragged band of outlaws are about to uncover a secret so vast, it could rip the universe apart.I'll admit, the plot seems kinda hokey.  But what makes a good sci-fi movie is not the plot (let's face it, the plot is ALWAYS hokey in this genre), it's how the plot is pulled off.  Director Joss Whedon manages to keep the film tight and taught, while the superb cast keeps it all human.  The outcome is this: a science fiction flick that is dark, funny, and delectible.  Whether you were a fan of the series, or are like me and knew nothing about it, you will enjoy this movie; there is literally something for everyone here."	5.0	A stellar, entertaining sci-fi romp!	2006-06-05	9	7	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	"Even though I'm a big science-fiction fan who watches Fox more than any other network, I somehow managed to never see an episode of Firefly.  That means I came on board the Serenity with basically no knowledge at all about the series or the characters.  Naturally, I now plan on watching the Firefly episodes in the near future, but there is a very real chance I will say something in this review that will be deemed rather stupid by loyal fans - but, rest assured, I intend to have nothing but good things to say about this movie.  It definitely can be enjoyed on its own merits, but I did feel as if I were missing out on some background, especially in terms of the recent war and the true natures of the Alliance, the colonists on the outer, wilder worlds, and of course the Reavers.  It was also a little hard to fully embrace the heroes at first because - well, they are basically criminals who aren't averse to leaving a few bodies in their wake when they do a job.  These are deep characters, however, and it takes time to get to know them, especially Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), who seems to run hot and cold all the time.  Of course, his mood swings are nothing compared to those of River Tam (Summer Glau), the young psychic super-girl currently being protected by Mal and his crew.  River was trained by the Alliance government to be a superhuman with extrasensory powers and lethal fighting skills.  I must say I always enjoy watching a woman stomp mudholes in wave after wave of bad guys - and this girl doesn't bother with taking any names when she gets her groove on.  What a woman!River was saved from her life as an Alliance-controlled guinea pig of death by her brother, who can be a little annoying in a Jerry O'Connell sort of way.  Naturally, the Alliance wants her back - not just for whom and what she is but also for the highly classified information she might have gleaned from people in authority.  Since she doesn't officially exist, the government can't just put out an interstellar APB on her; instead, they send in a smooth-talking, highly trained assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who doesn't let a little thing like countless innocent deaths get in the way of his mission.  As for Mal and some of his crew, they aren't even sure they want to keep River around anymore, especially after she goes Bruce Lee on a whole bar full of tough hombres for no discernible reason.  It's bad enough the Alliance is gunning for them just for having her onboard, but it starts to look like she could be a danger to them in and of herself.  Mal wants to know what secret she has buried in her fragile brain, though - given the hated Alliance's determined effort to find and eliminate her, he knows it must be a real threat to their position and power.  He's right, of course.Serenity is a remarkable movie - nay, concept - in many ways.  The very story itself represents a unique take on science fiction (although I can't say I saw a lot of Firefly's vaunted Western tie-in in the movie), one built on fascinating characters as much as futuristic technology and marvelous (and they are marvelous, by the way) shoot-'em-ups in space.  The ever-ingenious Joss Whedon likes to diverge from common wisdom and prove all the ""it will never work"" critics wrong, and part of that involves some pretty unexpected fates for his characters here in this big-budget crowd-pleaser of a feature film.  I can see where fans of the Firefly series might come away rather shocked on a couple of occasions.I could quibble about a couple of things in the film (such as the melodramatic romantic pause at one point just before the climax and the bad guy's decision to risk his life going after the hero when he had ample opportunity to just blow the guy's brains out as easy as you please), but I won't.  Serenity is a great movie and the ultimate vindication for Joss Whedon and his hand-picked actors who were mismanaged and then dropped mercilessly and far too quickly by Fox.  These TV execs gave the horrendously over-marketed and downright weak Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., a full year to prove itself, yet they axed Joss Whedon's Firefly after a mere 11 episodes (which they didn't even show in the right order)?  How stupid was that?  Just look at the rave reviews and sales of both Firefly and Serenity.  The show deserved better, and Serenity proves Mr. Universe right - they really can't stop the signal.  Let's hope there are further Serenity adventures to come - in any format."	5.0	Thankfully, even dumb old Fox TV execs can't stop the signal	2006-05-24	8	6	2

It was a vision of the future as viewed by the mastermind Joss Whedon. Unfortunately, Fox screwed over yet another quality show and cancelled Firefly. But due to the overwhelming demand of the fans and the cast and crew's love of the show, Firefly was reincarnated on the big screen.Serenity is merely the next episode of Firefly. Though it can be watched as a stand alone film, to fully appreciate it, it must be watched as part of the series. Sure, it's a step up from the TV show, but the acting stays superb throughout. By not using big name Hollywood stars, (not to say that the actors in the film aren't great) Joss Whedon achieves something unique without Hollywood's usual taint. His direction allowed this movie to achieve the great success that it did, though it was not met well by the public. Apparently the ignorant masses want the same old crap and not something fresh. But if you want to set yourselves apart from them, you will buy this movie and Firefly the tv series and you will see what we can do when we step outside the box and think for ourselves.	5.0	Firefly/Serenity is the best series ever made!	2006-07-24	5	4	1

This movie is so twisted, disgusting and campy, I can't decide if it should be categorized as a horror flick or an out-of-control comedy. But it was so bad, it wasn't funny!I'm also sick and tired of a rather dangerous message running through this film: Government is bad because it oppresses the poor, innocent, good guys. If only the those liberal meanies would leave us alone nothing bad would ever happen! Boo-Ho! Yeah, right! This terribly misguided libertarian message of ""no government is the best government,"" simply does not hold water in the real world.One final question: How do Living Dead-type zombies, who are unable to utter a single word, other than arrrrrrgh, pilot high-tech spaceships with ease? How do these zombies have the smarts to maintain these ships, and even go toe-to-toe in battle with the big, bad government? It seems in the world of Serenity being a blood thirsty, insane, speech impaired mutant is no obstacle to success!I hope I have discouraged you from spending your hard earned money on this really rotten piece of celluloid. But if I have failed, please do not let your children see this film. You'll thank me later!P.S. For those of you who continuely fawn over this movie with cult-like adoration, I humbly suggest that you learn what REAL Science Fiction has to offer. It will take only one book to open narrow minds: ""Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction,"" edited by Neil Barron.

Universal was kind enough to answer my questions about my Blu-ray's message at the start of the movie, ""resume off""; that is, the film must reload from the very beginning, trailers and all, if the film is stopped. Universal said this problem would not happen on a gaming device or a player that can connect to the internet. Serenity's extra features (a lot of them) require that connection. Similar problems occurred with Fox's Die Hard 2:  Die HarderDie Hard 2 - Die Harder [Blu-ray].  Contrary to advertising hype, Warner's Demolition Man did not play properly from a regular DVD, playing well only in full-screen mode (widescreen played with comments by the director). The anomalies I have found with a Blu-ray player aside, Serenity is a visual wonder and well worth the purchase if it will be played on a compatible device.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2JLSQGDZZUNG	Dante1138	Serenity is probably my favorite sci-fi film since Aliens, and a much closer franchise in feel to the original Star Wars then anything since The Empire Strikes Back. It is different in its tone from Firefly, the show that it follows (it is more plot and action driven than the delightfully meandering space western series) but the heart is still the same, with the most delightful set of characters this side of a Stagecoach.  Those who love Firefly/Serenity wax poetic about it to a nauseating degree, and I fall into this myself often times, so I will just say that if you have never seen the film or the series, both are worth your time.  There.As for the Blu Ray, I bought it as an upgrade over my DVD copy of the film. It is definitely a superior disc, but how much you notice will definitely depend on your set up. The film is often shot in dark, grainy interiors, an effective stylistic choice, but not one that lends itself to HD scrutiny. The image is by no means bad, it just won't be your reference disc any time soon. In exterior shots and during the space sequences, the HD shines through much more clearly, and it is a significant bump up from the standard definition version.The audio track is 5.1, but I would warn that you really need a 5.1 set up to appreciate it, or even to prefer it, to the DVD sound mix. Due to space restrictions in our TV room we are stuck with a soundabar with sub system that tries to emulate 5-channel surround sound through 3 speakers. On this set-up while watching Serenity, the dialogue often sounds too bright. Many times entire chunks of dialogue sound a bit like they've been looped (re-recorded after filming) which may or may not have been the case but were unnoticeable on the same set-up with the DVD.  Sound effects are booming and robust but fall into the familiar problem of being drastically louder than dialogue, so even with DAC cranked up you may have to ride the volume button through the entire film.  Again, this may be a result of using a soundbar instead of a 5.1 or 7.1 surround system, but it is a valid point to mention.Overall, the Blu Ray of this fantastic film is a clearly superior disc to the old DVD version. While it's not anywhere close to being one of the top looking discs out there, it is the best-looking - and depending on your set-up, best-sounding - version of this amazing movie you are going to find.	4.0	An Excellent Film, A Very Good Blu Ray	2011-11-14	4	4	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2KKU74N2Z3T52	"Dave Fisher ""Chucklehead"""	Firefly was a short-lived but well written and acted series that I enjoyed as much as Farscape. The characters are believable, displaying their flaws as well as their strengths. The story-line is a nice twist of genres that gives a new take on the space theme. Serenity is a nice conclusion to the story. It neatly wraps up the main story and leaves the possibilities open for future stories (that unfortunately will never be made). I do think the Firefly series is a pre-requisit before viewing Serenity, otherwise you step into the last 3rd of the story without the details needed to make sense of it all.

I cheered with the crowd.  I was on the edge of my seat.  I fell off my seat.Thankfully it is dark in theaters.Serenity, the much anticipated capstone to the beloved television series Firefly (inexplicable left at the alter by network arch villain FOX) exploded from the screen as I sat reveling in nothing less than rapture.Who knew movies could be so fun?I knew.  I remember my first screening of Star Wars.  We were five minutes late and I nearly died from the agony.  Then...magically... I was somewhere else.  I was in a galaxy far, far away.Fast forward nearly 30 years to that shiny moment, when once again, I was far, far away.  This time courtesy of Serenity's brilliant cast of characters, plot twists that sprayed loose change from my pockets, pulse-jamming special effects, spine-tingling creepiness, guffaw-evoking wit, and just enough heart, soul, and camaraderie to inspire even the faithless.That, in a nutshell, is Serenity.I loved it.p.s.  In a slightly more comprehensive nutshell, the movie Serenity is the sweeping finale to Josh Whedon's amazing space/western epic: Firefly.  After rewatching Serenity, it is now my advice to begin your adventure, not with it, but with the television series Firefly.  Beg, borrow, or buy Firefly and its truly gifted ensemble cast and then experience Serenity.  Otherwise, I'm not sure a person new to Whedon`s ""verse"" can fully appreciate all of the plotlines and nuances jam-packed into this stunning finale. To be fair to new viewers, Firefly and Serenity do have an occasional hard - but realistic - edge, so it may behoove you to preview the series before buying.  That said, Firefly/Serenity is, bar none, my favorite science fiction series of all time."	5.0	If I had a nickel for every science fiction movie I loved, I'd have 10 cents.	2006-07-25	6	5	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3KHFRTRUPJKHH	"Dave Jeffery ""Author of Amazon UK #1 Bestsell..."	In Joss Whedon's vision of the future, a hybrid superpower known only as 'the alliance' dominates a solar system still ravaged by a war long since done. Settlers occupy the outer rim, facing a literal final frontier as they battle with the hardships of poverty and technological breakdown and raids by cannabalistic humanoids known as 'reevers'. Amid this chaos add a ship full of brigands who harbour two fugatives on the run from the alliance, one of whom may be the most powerful weapon known to man.It should be run of the mill space fantasy but Whedon's strengths as a writer and first time big screen director hone this movie into a rewarding experience for the viewer. The dialogue effortlessly flits from wiscracking humour to social commentary. The action set pieces more than justify a round of applause.Once an axed TV show now Serenity is a 'leaf on the wind.'

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A255E7076ZVL7A	"David Clark ""Mystic Orangutan"""	It's funny--I find myself agreeing with both the rave and the ravaging reviews of Serenity. I think it was a good, solid movie--an excellent sci-fi run, far above the typical Hollywood fare. Whedon and crew did a good job of wrapping up a major and involved storyline in a short space of time. Acting was generally high quality, special effects were excellent even on small budget, and the movie paced fairly well, dealt its blows where they needed to be, and managed (mostly) to avoid cheesiness and irrelevance.But at the same time, Serenity is quite clearly a hasty farewell, a mere summation of what would have been. The story wraps up a pretty major arc (one of several) that was building in the first season of the show. Given the arc's scope and the nuances involved for the characters in running it out, it seems that it would have stretched on for some time on television. Compressed into feature length, though, it loses the space to make its contents truly memorable (and heartbreaking and wonderful), and instead feels more like an exciting synopsis than satisfying tale.Serenity's atmosphere is also somewhat different from the TV series. The lighting is for some reason bluer than on the show, and a little bleaker, as if a little overexposed. Less sienna and brown, fewer seedy spaceports. And the characters feel as if they've been revisited after some time on the shelf, which seems to be the case. In it I can see what would have been a tremendous story, in which characters I love are drawn through a torturous gauntlet that tests and shapes all of them, makes them all indispensible. But series cancellation and a mere two hours of screen time isn't enough space to do the story, the characters, or the universe justice, though Whedon et al. do a truly amazing job with what they have.In sum, see it, expect something great, expect resolution, but do not expect exactly the TV show you fell in love with. And be ready to let go of some things.	4.0	Good and Bad	2006-01-14	6	6	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AI9STF7QHFDGV	"David Coy ""Author of the Dominant Species Series"""	This space western does such a good job of character building it's no wonder it was so popular. The bad characters drive the action perfectly and with malicious intent and the good characters deal with the adversity brilliantly. Conceptually, most SF builds on what came before it. Serenity has no such limitations: it builds on something else. It's hard to describe why a story with so little in the way of truly original thought plays so well on all levels. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that when all the pieces come together just right, originally takes a back seat to synergy and perfect execution. You could have put the troupe of misfits in Serenity in covered wagons on the western plains and the story would have worked just as well. Convert them to pirates on the open seas and the stories would still play. Make them a band of renegade rebel soldiers and the basic plot lines would hold up with a few adjustments. I loved this film and after seeing it, immediately watched the DVDs of the series, and I was surprised by how well the feature film preserved those elements that made the series work so well - the characters - fascinating, complex, fully developed and above all, entertaining. Good characters are the basis of good drama. Brilliant drama is where you find it.	4.0	A character-driven movie	2007-04-25	7	5	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AFPNHI528ET60	David C. Reynolds Jr.	"Over the last year, I heard quite a bit of buzz over the Internet and other communities about a series called ""Firefly"".  So many folks saying what a fantastic show it was and how it's so horrible that the series was ended so prematurely.  I found my self visiting the DVD section every time I visited the local Target stores--just looking at the Firefly DVD over and over thinking to myself ""Some day I'll get a copy and see what the buzz is all about.""  Heck, it was only 20something dollars!!!  You would have thought I could spare that for a whole season of a completely ""buzzed about"" series...  Well, I turned 41 this past June (that would be in 2007).  On my birthday, my ex-BF gave me Firefly.  A busy life I lead, so it took me a while (about a month) before I popped it into the old DVD player.  When I did, however, I was enthralled (almost literally glued to my seat) for the next few days.  Watching episode after episode, the only thought running through my head was how any TV executive in his/her right mind would cancel this series before the first season was over.  So much ""crud"" on television today, and this gem, this jewel, this extremely intelligent Space Opera has been passed over!  I literally am sick to my stomach thinking about how I'm going to watch the last episode of the series tomorrow night.  Yes, there are special features to be seen after the last episode, and I am grateful.  But it's all overshadowed by the pit I feel in my stomach--the pit of knowing that I have only been given a glimpse of this world, and really won't get to see much of it ever again...  I do have the release of the special edition of Serenity to look forward to.  Release Date:  08/21--feels like forever right now...  I guess I just need to be glad that I really do have more than just the final episode to watch--I have the movie as well.  Well, I know this is supposed to be a review of the Serenity movie, and not the FireFly series, but the two are so intertwined that you can't help talk about one when you talk about the other.  Well, here's wishing that the word get spread so far and wide about how fantastic that this series (and I'm sure, the movie as well) is, that the ""powers that be"" will pull their collective heads out of the sand and do what is necessary to entice, empower, or  Joss Whedon into continuing this master in some form or fashion to satisfy the emptiness that I'm about to experience.

Both the series and the movie are unsung heroes in that they are something new to the genre, with an experienced cast that demonstrated chemistry from day one of the series' launch in 2003.The movie is quite intelligent, with excellent depth for many of the characters, while still supplying the kind of action and excitement that keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the movie.  The villain in the story is fascinating as well, one who is both complementary to Mal and a counterpoint.  The villain, known as ""The Operative, is a ""believer,"" who ardently seeks human perfection, which underscores how dramatically he misunderstands humanity.The last minutes of the film have a powerful message both in terms of the story as well as for the world around us.  I won't spoil the movie for readers, but I will say that this movie will disturb you, enlighten you and, ultimately, inspire you.This is one of the best scifi movies to hit the big screen in at least the last 10 years.

I loved the ""Firefly"" series and own it on DVD -- and if you're already up to speed on the characters and history of the ship, this is a five-star entry. For newcomers, however, I'd have to say it's not quite as compelling. Without knowing the characters' history and quirks, you won't ""get"" a lot of the references.  Some of the deleted scenes -- especially those explaining Inara's relationship to Mal -- should have been left in. And there are a couple of places where the storyline seems to go off-track. (How did the Alliance Operative get past the Reavers to do battle with Mal near the end?)  Still, this is a fun, fast-paced movie, and if you're a Firefly fan, you definitely ought to see it.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1RCMRZ3JKX2QL	"D. Erben ""David Lawrence"""	"The show worked best on the small screen: the movie is awful.  If your a purist of the Firefly series, you will be more than a little annoyed at some of the plot changes that make much of the Firefly series irrelevant. By way of example, the pursuing ""two by two with hands of blue"" (if you remember the song River sings in the series) are replaced by a single self-effacing samauri (the ""psy"" angle that numerous episodes developed is abandoned completely in the movie).In terms of characters, all of the Firefly actors and characters return, but some just hang about in the film with nothing really to do and looking, at times, a bit useless.The ending is very predictable and what you end of doing is just sitting around waiting for the inevitable deus ex machina and wondering why it took so long - but of course the answer is obvious why it took so long.One of the things that really annoys me about this film is the fact that the ""universe"" looks like a rip off of the Star Wars universe:  the evil Alliance looks and feels a lot like the Empire in Star wars and Mel is really a minor clone of Hans Solo. He even dresses and acts like Solo, always saying tough things but in the end doing what is ""right."" The banter about their ship, ""Serenity,"" is also a familiar banter made most famous in Star Wars.Finally, as with a lot of tv sci fi programs, the creators seem to have lost their way with the opportunity to make a ""film."" Time and time again you see successful tv series episodes that deal with simple plots that develop characters (this was especially successful with the best Next Generations episodes)and then you see the show move to the big screen and, inevitablly, the plot has to involve ""big"" issues: saving the universe, saving humanity from an evil policital force, uncovering and then telling the Truth to the masses, blah blah blah. You get all of that here and it makes the show have a very superficial quality to it.  It's just a fact that people who work on the small screen have a very hard time moving their concepts to the big screen and this movie is a prime example of that problem."	2.0	Hope for the series to return	2006-01-14	48	11	37
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2AGVVQ89ZC3N0	DerFrownmacher	First of all, I had only seen one episode of the TV series when I saw this movie, and was expecting little more than a distracting action-filled romp. However, I was surprised to encounter excellent dialogue, a unique storyline, and nearly all the epic Space Opera goodness you could want. Also, this movie had humor. Sure, some of the jokes were a little lame, but for the most part, they were amusing, and the movie manages to employ even the most predictable one liners in manner James Bond could only hope to achieve. Though certainly not a revolution for the genre, Serenity was still an excellent movie that kept me entertained and enthralled throughout.P.S.: I have bo idea whats up with the cover art for the DVD. It features scenes that didn't happen and a completely different actress than the one featured in the movie. Perhaps it's merely a concept rendition from an earlier age.	4.0	Tv Seires or Not-A Refreshing Sci-Fi	2005-11-22	6	4	2

That being said, the way it just...ended was completely unsatisfying. Like so many fans, I was hoping they would bring the series back. That obviously couldn't happen considering most of the principal actors had moved on to other projects, so this was the next best thing. The movie picks up a bit after the series ends, but it also goes back to before the series started to help wrap up a lot of what the series never had a chance to. The storyline is epic, as is proper for a major motion picture, and the fight scenes are awesome. They also preserved the humor and playfulness of the series.

It is an intelligent, fresh approach to space science fiction, a genre that was full of stereotypes, faulty physics and improbable aliens.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ADWE55QGEWB4M	D. Henshaw	"Following the series of Firefly, Serenity continues the story line for a few  more steps.  There are so many ways this movie is packed I cannot begin to properly mention them here.  The storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a ""solving the mystery"" approach.  The english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand- mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing.  The animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality.  The characters are complex, focused, solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations.  The challenges the crew of Serenity face are many: from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority ""Alliance"" forces to the overt mortal threat of the ""Reavers"".  The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue.  The music in Serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more.  I suggest seeing the series Firefly before watching the movie Serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters."	5.0	A well packed space drama	2006-11-10	4	4	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	I watched Serenity in the cinema without having seen Firefly. Very simply, Serenity is an outstanding Sci Fi film with a great storyline and laced throughout with wry and gritty humour. Characterisation is very good, indeed, and melds superbly with the aforementioned storyline and humour. Basically the characterisation depicts real people and this makes the difference.Serenity is also an example of the Sci Fi genre making relevant social comment but sadly this probably contributed to the cancellation of the tv series from which it is derived.Joss Whedon (the series creator) has made a space saga set 500 hundred years in the future. With undertones of the Old West, Mankind has been colonising other planets and moons. A bitter civil war between Separatists and the Alliance Government has recently finished, resulting in the victory of the Alliance. This government tends to interfere in every day life, is ultra politically correct, and seems to be in hock to mega corporations..... (Hmmm I wonder what the parody there could be?!!).Eking out an existence among the many worlds, is a survivor of the Separatist forces - Captain Mal Reynolds (played well by a wry Nathan Fillion). His command is an old spaceship called Serenity. Mal Reynolds and his crew smuggle and deal in contraband etc. They also take on passengers on a 'no questions asked' basis.Recent additions to the crew of the Serenity include a young doctor - Simon and his telepathic sister - River. Both are fleeing from the Alliance, and River was a test subject for drug research on psychics. This testing was carried out by the Alliance and the mega Corporations, and both want her returned swiftly. Hunting River and Simon, is an Alliance elite officer/assassin known as an operative. Superbly played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, he is a glacially calm, reflective, and totally ruthless individual, determined to catch River and Simon by any means possible.Apart from the Alliance, the crew of the Serenity have to face other dangers including the Reavers who are horrifically deformed space cannibals who hunt the cosmos, looking for victims to be eaten alive, dead not being to their taste (so to speak).Serenity is a brilliant film from start to finish and will keep the viewer wholly engrossed. I was surprised and delighted with how good it actually was, and went back for a repeat viewing at the cinema. I also bought the dvd when it came out, and again it makes for terrific viewing on the home cinema system. Sound and picture are both superb on an HDMI picture and multi channel sound.I also bought the dvd of the tv series Firefly and really enjoyed this too. In fact I am glad that I saw the film first because if I had seen the tv series first, then I might have had some unrealistic expectations for the film version. Like many other reviewers on here, I am amazed that the tv series was cancelled but there do appear to be a number of reasons for this, and I intend to look at these in more detail when I write my review of Firefly the tv series. The film, however, ties up many of the loose ends from the tv series.Good news for fans is that Whedon and Universal apparently have another two films of Serenity in the pipeline, and I for one cannot wait to see them.	5.0	Simply outstanding	2006-05-16	4	3	1

I'm not sure how much a viewer who hadn't already watched the ""Firefly"" TV series would get out of this, but if you get the ""Firefly"" box set and this feature film together, then you will be in for one heckuva good time.  The film looks good, the actors are all in fine form, the fight choreography is spectacular, and that good old Joss Whedon sense of humor is right there, weird and wonderful as it ever was.  Plus, it's not just a recap of the TV plot, but rather a lively, smart coda to that great storyline.  I wish all pop culture could be this intelligent and this much fun.Yay, Joss.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AIGG2XIM3STZA	D. Kallen	I love the way this movie turns traditional sci-fi movies upside-down by breaking cliches left and right, while still being exciting and, most of all, making you care about the characters. Probably the best part is the humor. I can't remember the last time I saw real, genuine humor in a sci-fi movie. Even the Hitch-hiker's movie fell short in that regard. Serenity's humor is based in the characters, so it rings true. The movie also jumps so quickly between laughter and pathos and back again that you really need to hold on to your seat. A great adventure-- A movie to make you excited about movies again.	5.0	Breaking sci-fi traditions	2005-10-12	7	5	2

A well made movie, perhaps with some plot problems regarding Miranda and the Reavers.  There is also a visual tip of the hat to a famous Star Wars fight scene between Luke and Darth Vadar, but still a fun ride and a treat to any fan of the series.	5.0	Serenity	2011-08-29	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2VWAOHAJ70Q1B	D. M. She	I wasn't going to watch this.  Joss Whedon had a huge loyal fan base for Buffy:  he abandoned his fans at the end, giving us about a year and a half of ruination of what had been a really good story.  I swore I would never watch a Whedon production again.  But it has been a long time, there was nothing else promising available, and the reviews looked good.  Boy, did I get suckered.This movie was not only poorly scripted with plot holes you could drive a Semi through, but it was also a thin propeganda film.  The major plot point, around which all the others revolved, was a young woman begging to be forgiven for trying to make people better.  Oh, please, Mr. Cowboy, save us from the nanny state.As to Joss being a feminist, puh-leez.  He 'creates' stereotypical male charecters and then puts boobs and long hair on them.  He wouldn't recognize feminist epistemology if it bit him on the nose.If you MUST watch this sorry excuse for a movie, please rent, don't buy.	1.0	Positive reviews fooled me	2011-12-18	63	4	59

I have yet to introduce this to someone who didn't like it.  This story needs more pumped into it.  There are so many plots from the series left to explore and such depth of the characters to push them forward.  Now all we need is some plausible cloning subplot or something of the sort to bring back Wash and Book.  Hmmmm.	5.0	The proof is in the DVD sales	2007-12-19	2	2	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3FTKIEW818ITS	doctj	I first watched this movie on DVD when initially released without having watched firefly. I found it to be a very good movie at the time. I recently got round to watching the series Firefly and with a better understanding of the background and characters it made the movie even better on my second viewing. The movie's tone is darker than in the series but being a feature film I suspect this is one of the compromises that had to be made.I rewatched this movie on Blu Ray, the Picture quality is excellent but I did find the audio to be lacking where dialog would be obscured by the background music/explosions. I often had to raise my volume to decipher what was being said. Surround effects such as explosions, flight scenes were quite good however. I viewed this on an htpc with TMT 5 software, Radeon 6570 capable of DTS HD-MA bitstreaming.On another note Blu Ray case's spine was cracked which is why I give it a 4 star overall rating in conjunction with the audio.	4.0	"""I'm unarmed""....

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1K5UB53EF535X	Donald M. Boettger	"I'll admit it right up front: I'm a Firefly/Serenity geek.  I've seen the movie nine times in the theater (by far the most for me, any film, any genre).  I've never developed such a deep connection with any other entertainment franchise with the possible exceptions of ""The Lord Of the Rings"" -- the books, mainly, though the movies were great too -- the ""Narnia"" series, and ""Watership Down"".So what is it about this fictional world that draws me in so?  Has senility kicked in and I'm experiencing my second childhood?  Maybe, but I think I still have a bit of critical judgement left.I think the real reason is that this is science fiction done right.  It's not about bumpy-headed alien monsters or supernatural forces.  It's about people, ordinary people like you and me who find themselves caught up in events outside their control.  It's about holding things together when every force in the 'verse is trying to rip them apart.Technically, this film is beautiful, with just enough SFX to tell the story without having the effects become the story.  The one really heavy CGI sequence is a head-spinning thrill ride, but it's not what the movie is about.""Serenity"" is far more fast-paced than the Firefly series was, and that's a mixed blessing.  The serial television format allows for more deliberate pacing and character development, which is compressed in the movie.  One side effect is that ""Serenity"" holds up well to multiple viewings, as you catch the nuances that might have flown past too quickly on the first pass.  On the upside, the fast pacing means this film is action packed.  There are more twists and turns in its first nine minutes than most movies give you in their entire running length.Even so, ""Serenity"" takes enough time to show you the lighter side of these characters.  There are a lot of laughs here, including a few really big ones.  Some of them come just when the tension seems to be nearly unbearable.  That's a sign of gifted writing.Though it's never rubbed in your face, the movie also carries a timely political message, demonstrating how evil may result from the best of intentions.It's no surprise that Firefly has more female fans than many other SF tales.  If I may be permitted a gross generalization, women tend to be more empathetic and relationship oriented than men.  ""Serenity"" has what women, and men who are in touch with that attribute, are looking for: people you care about, trying to hang on to their humanity at the raggedy edge."	5.0	It's about the people...	2005-11-02	66	64	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"If you've never seen Firefly--the film upon which Serenity is based--you should. It's a terrific series and was poorly handled by the network leading to an unfair demise. However, if you don't want to have to watch an entire television series in order to watch a film, that's alright; Serenity stands on its own.Serenity, the name of a spaceship, is about a rag-tag band of folks on the fringe of the law, as they get dragged into a battle against the oppressive intergalactic government that the captain of that ship (the Han Solo-esque Mal Reynolds) doesn't necessarily want to fight. It is sci-fi action at a very high level, with wonderful writing and directing from the masterful Joss Whedon. (He is responsible for three of the best television series of the last ten years.)Whether you've seen the series, or not, this is an excellent movie you're sure to enjoy. For fans of the show, I don't have to tell you much, except that the same qualities found on the smaller screen can be seen here to their full effect. The one warning I have to offer here is: be prepared when you watch this movie; it moves quickly and does not pull any punches, emotionally. Do not be fooled by the fact that it is ""science fiction""--it is serious drama.Five stars."	5.0	An Awesome Television Series Becomes an Awesome Movie	2006-06-06	8	6	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2WHFJLN0R2PD6	Don Cristobel	My expectations for this movie were not that high. I am a Sci-fi fan and saw a few episodes of the series before seeing this but many big screen sci-fi movies just end up sacrificing story for action.I came away from this thinking it was one of the most entertaining movies I had seen all year, and my wife, who is not a sci-fi fan, felt the same way.The world it takes place is the future earth. There are no aliens, it is more like say Dune where it is assumed humans have colonized the universe alone. The writers have evolved language & culture along believable lines so it looks like a familiar yet foreign world to us.  I really appreciate that sort of attention to detail (something you'll never find in Star Trek).The movie is not going to win any awards, but it is extremely entertaining with believable characters and an engaging story.	5.0	Suprisingly Entertaining	2006-07-13	5	4	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A22J9WI2PDAVJ	Don D. Basina	Serenity rebukes the traditional Hollywood system for making TV series into movies.  A successful TV series gets its niche viewers established and then a movie deal is struck.  Serenity was based on the 2002 Firefly TV series. This series was pulled after its first year. It was not allowed to age and prosper.After Firefly gets cancelled, Director and writer Joss Whedon decides to make a movie based on his television show Firefly. To build movie hype, He says to his viewers to get the word out utilized unconventional means. First of all he pleads with Firefly viewers to spread the word about his upcoming Serenity movie using internet blogs and chat rooms. The word of the movie Serenity starts running rampant with his new sci-fi thriller.Serenity stands by itself as a great movie. The viewer can quickly catch on to the feel of the movie. Firefly TV series followers will not be disappointed as Joss Whedon stays the course of the TV series. Humor and action is still utilized along with modern day innuendos which give this movie some repeat viewing.Capt. Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) commands his lady (Serenity ship) and its crew of personalities.  Second command Zo (Gina Torres), Pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), Muscle Jayne (Adam Baldwin), Engineer Kaylee (Jewel Straite) and Mal's flame Inara (Morena Baccarin). When Mal picks up Doctor Simon's (Sean Maher) sister River (Summer Glau) strange things happen. Everyone is suddenly after them. It could be the Reavers (crazy human cannibals, Alliance assassins and/or possibly his own crew.I give this DVD a must buy for Sci-Fi thrillers.

Whedon's farewell to the short-running series was as much a eulogy for what should have been a huge hit as it was a masterpiece of science fiction film. Exciting, mysterious, and containing action sequences that rival the &#34;video game&#34; movies that plague the screen today, without losing the familial chemistry of the cast nor the humor that was such a large part of the &#34;Firefly&#34; television series.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2BEU7GPGNIG44	Dorrie Wheeler	"If you were a fan of the short lived television show Firefly chances are you will enjoy the movie Serenity.The movie features the original cast from the television series in an intergalactic mission. Early in the film the crews doctor Simon rescues his mysterious sister River Tam. River has been held by people who have been pumping her head full of memories that are not her own. After rescuing River, Serenity's crew finds themselves in much danger as the people who were holding River will stop at no means to get her back because of the secrets she holds.Nathan Fillion stars as Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, the captain of Serenity. He doesn't mind having River on board because he feels that she has a sixth sense that can help them when they go on their bounty missions. Gina Torres also stars in the film as Zoe a fiery crew member who doesn't like when the crew has to use guns but won't hesitate to fire when she has to. The renegade crew has to survive crazed cannibals known as Revers and they have to stay one step ahead of the killers who want River Tam back. Popular character actor Ron Glass (Barney Miller), has a small role in the film as a shepard that the crew seeks guidance from. Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor steals the show with his amazing role as an assasin out to kill River Tam. He is so believable in his role that when his character experiences a change of heart it's unbelievable.The bottom line is that if you watched the television series Firefly you will enjoy this film 10 times more than a casual film viewer. I watched this film with my mother, who watched Firefly and she was filling in gaps for me that the writers of the film didn't address for the person watching the film who had never seen the television series. The pace of the movie mixed with the lack of big name stars and mediocre score makes it seem much more like a made for television or made for cable movie than a theatrical release. It's an enjoyable film, even though the ending is a little far fetched and anti-climatic. It's a very engaging film."	4.0	Engaging Even If You Never Saw FireFly	2005-12-28	8	6	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1LPH8WY0JGUDK	"Douglas Finton ""dfinton"""	"As a person who initially committed to the HD DVD format, partly in order to view this wonderful movie in a high-definition print, I must say this is not the review I expected to be writing. Bottom line: the HD DVD was beautiful; the Blu-ray is even better.For context, I'm evaluating these on a 50"" Pioneer Elite Kuro TV through very good electronics, but without the newer HDMI 1.3 ability to pass a lossless, true DTS HD sound signal by means of that connection.  So when I say that the sound on the Blu-ray is much more dynamic than on the HD DVD, I am comparing apples-to-apples the converted digital signal as processed by my 3-year old Pioneer Elite AVR.  Not only does the Blu-ray deliver a far greater dynamic range, but the center channel dialogue is much clearer than I have ever heard it, including in any theater.  The directionality and clarity of the surround effects are simply awesome, putting this disc in the demonstration-quality range for the sound alone.But it doesn't stop there. The picture is also the most vibrant I have seen it: vivid color saturation, and accurate reproduction of the visuals I remember from the theater, not to mention it being the first time I have ever experienced the computer-generated special effects scenes as looking truely high-def themselves.  All in all, a recommended purchase for Serenity fans; lovers of that type of sci-fi film that, like the original Day the Earth Stood Still, assays a rarified level of artistry and social commentary; and (yeah, I admit it) an incredible Blu-ray experience.  The differences are worth it."	5.0	Blu-ray version eclipses all others	2009-05-07	9	9	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3154RZHJMP24	Douglas Henderson	Battle Star Galactica DVD's lead me to reviews of Firefly on Amazon recently, so ordered both the series and the movie--following the advice in other's comments to watch the series, then the movie. Simply delighted to discover an unknown, well crafted Sci-fi show--which Firefly certainly is.  The TV series was great fun, mixed with regret that it was all going to end too soon--its sad fate sealed and finished years earlier from corporate dictates.Once bonded to the first, short Firefly season, the movie brings  welcomed, well developed characters (with much unsaid) back to life on the screen, spewing the same clever diologue (sometimes breathlessly), some tying up loose ends.  My compliments to the special-effects guys for launching a space craft that looks like a duck and gains the effection I usually reserve for my '81 Subaru wagon. The sequence where a Reever ship follows Serenity through the Alliance battle, blazing away with a continuous ray bolt accompanied with a deep electric hum was noticably original in my book.  To great satisfaction, River's quiet, disconcerning persona is finally unleashed toward the movie's end.Genuinely sorry to see such a good cast and concept come and go as it has. I'll miss this idea. Someone should e-mail the 628 reviews here to date (just from the movie released in Sept. 2005) to the Fox gods on high to remind them they turned gold to dust.As it turned out, my Firefly DVD first season set had two disc 1's--missing Disc 2.

For those who haven't though I recommend checking out the show before going into this movie even though you don't have to. Serenity sets up the characters so you won't be lost going into it, but I would at least try to find and watch the two hour pilot to Firefly since that really sets up the characters and the story well so you will understand and appreciate the movie more. On it's own Serenity is a great film but put into context with Firefly it really gets better. It has a great story and some really great twists that you won't expect. Overall Serenity is a great ending to one of the best tv series of all time.	5.0	A Must See Movie	2013-03-23	0	0	0

This is the first time that I have signed on to a ""fan"" thing (club, zine, whatever...) since I was a kid.  Being that I'm on the wrong side of 50, that's saying something.  Why 4 (and a half!) and NOT 5?  Because the film could not scale the heights of character development that a continued (reborn) TV series could have attained.As a stand alone film, there was simply TOO MUCH story to tell.Read the other raves and you will have me agreeing with them 9 out of 10.As far as a pure Sci-Fi film, it is as good and better than any I have seen lately: Potter 4 (4... snooze); Sith: (Yawn, snooze until the pretty damn good Volcano planet... I was distracted by the CGI effects which were so pervasive I found myself analyzing textures, and lighting synchronization, etc); War of the Worlds (good film, but give me a break, with all that technology they had to use tentacles with cheesy cameras to sniff out survivors???  Do you REALIZE how long that would take??? Cmon...  Even better than Batman Begins which I really enjoyed.  Better than Fantastic Four (yeah, I hear you chuckling too...).For the price they are asking for this DVD edition (I have a multizone machine and thus can play the Zone 1 version over here in France) the DVD package as such deserves a solid 5.Now the film itself, for the far too many of you who took a pass during its all too brief run in the theatres: Joss Whedon did what Speilberg, Lucas, and so many others seem no longer able to do: he took difficult material (I mean: HOW to breing viewers who had NEVER seen the 14 epidodes of the series up to speed, keep them spellbound until the final finish, all with a relatively small budget?  Well, here's how he did it: character development on the fly, and he hooked in 90% of the viewers who DID see it.  Special effects came second place to the true story telling.  And for pure content we give them a 5.Here's the browncoat guarantee:  Buy the Firefly Serenity combo package deal.  Watch all the episodes through.  Then once again with the commentaries.  Then read the book ""Finding Serenity"", then the Dark Horse Trilogy and THEN view the Serenity DVD.  If, after all that you are not happy.  Sell your combo on ebay.  You WILL find a buyer (we browncoats snap them up for cheap gifts for friends, such is our evangelical zeal... watch OUT, papa Hubbard) and you will only be out the price of a couple of tickets to the movies.  And you will have been intertained for well over 20 hours.  There is a good reason that Serenity is number one and Firefly is number 3 on the Amazon list.Neurochuck...

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ACLPPDR7I9NFL	"Dr Gafia ""Dr Gafia"""	"I should perhaps explain where I'm coming from to provide perspective and context for my review: I've been an avid sf reader for more than half a century, an active member of sf fandom almost as long and I'm a published writer of sf and fantasy. I'm also an unabashed Joss Whedon fan. (I didn't much care for the ""Buffy"" movie, so owe this to my daughter's urging to watch the tv series; I now have all seasons of Buffy and Angel on DVD, as well as Firefly and Serenity, and even Tim Minear's Wonder Falls.)But I'm something of a snob when it comes to movies. I make distinctions between sf and ""sci fi""; the former are rare, the latter being generally distinguished by containing either ""dumbed-down"" science or, worse, stupid scientific mistakes (and are sometimes even anti-science). I never ran into the problem with Buffy or Angel because they're fantasy, where you can pretty much make it up as you go (although internal consistency is a definite plus).But when you lose all scientific credibility in sci fi, you generally lose the respect of any sf readers. Both Firefly and Serenity manage to come down with major scientific blunders, and while as an sf reader this does sadden me, you'll note I've still purchased the DVDs of both. Like fingernails on a blackboard, they're annoying; but it's possible to shudder and move on if there's any acceptable reason to do so.I've encountered my share of people who claim to be sf fans who are really just fans of sci fi SFX, but I'm afraid not even the finest eye candy has ever made me respect that segment of the genre; Firefly and Serenity are only rescued to the extent they are not by technical wizardry but by Joss Whedon's forte, compelling character-driven story telling. It's still sci fi, so the series and the movie are, for me at least, a guilty pleasure. And, sure, I wish Joss had a decent science advisor, because it would not have been hard to make his sci fi series and movie into real science fiction but, oh, well, I guess you really can't have everything.The ignorance ranges from the far-reaching and general to the specific. Characters use words like 'verse (as in ""universe"") and galaxy apparently without any knowledge of what they really mean. Firefly/Serenity's basic premise is flawed: A star-system with a G-type sun relatively close to ours with ""hundreds"" of roughly Earth-sized planets and moons close enough to that sun for us to colonize and terraform them, yet far enough from each other that some would be ""central"" and others would be at a significantly greater distance away from that supposed ""core,"" is a contradiction too great to be believed even with both eyes closed real tight and your hands firmly covering them. One of the best-told stories of the series, the episode entitled ""Out of Gas,"" unfortunately highlights the fact that Whedon (and those working with him) is abysmally ignorant of basic science, as it violates Newton's First Law of Motion.But the story-telling! Oh, yeah! Fully realized flesh-and-blood three-dimensional characters doing and saying things that make us *care about* what happens to them.  You just won't find this in sci fi movies -- or most science fiction movies, either, I must admit.  It makes the series and the movie into sci fi that even an sf reader could love.Regretfully, as a fan of the series, I must add that the movie was a bit of a disappointment. It was twice as long but had about half the emotional depth of a single average series episode -- and what emotional impact the movie had was almost entirely dependent on having seen the series. A couple of the Good Guys get it in the neck, but neither of them have been developed sufficiently in the movie to make their deaths meaningful to the movie audience; we haven't even seen enough of Zoe for most who may first come across her in the movie to realize how atypically nearly suicidal she becomes as the film is reaching its climax. Almost everything in the movie that has emotional resonance is dependent on knowing more about the characters than the movie chooses to tell the viewer.The motion picture, finally, is not quite set in the same universe as the tv series. The opening scene shows Simon's rescue of his sister Summer, in which he takes a very active part and learns a great deal about what was done to her; in the series, Simon arranged (through the payment of a great deal of money) for her rescue but did not take part in it and had to learn what the Alliance had done to her over a period of time. The captain also appears to regard them as passengers who need to earn their keep, having apparently forgotten that in the series he had already made Simon part of the crew for his surgical expertise.Then too, the only scene which gives the viewer any understanding of what a Companion is has been deleted from the final cut; given that Mal disguises himself as a monk to rescue Inara and that she lights incense (that isn't actually incense) and begins to pray for him when she first sees him while he is trying to do so would probably make movie-goers who'd not seen the series think she must be some kind of a nun. (Not a typo.)The movie has not been a box office success, as it has yet to earn back its costs in ticket sales. It would appear that few people who were not fans of the series actually went to the theater to see it. If DVD sales are fairly high, it might yet wind up in the black, but alas those who canceled the series (and who may have opposed making the movie) appear to be vindicated, since these figures will almost certainly be cited to prove that the tv and movie-going audiences prefer cute aliens, wacky robot sidekicks and mindless SFX to character-driven stories in their sci fi (or, for that matter, even in the rare science fiction) movies and tv fare. The liklihood that there will be future films in the Serenity universe, given these facts, seems extremely low.It nonetheless earns, flaws and all, three stars from me. But a little more attention to detail, more character development for those who came new to it at the movies and putting in the effort to make it science fiction might have renderd this a five-star movie.

Anyone who tries to shine a spotlight on the lies of the government is labeled a traitor and a terrorist.In spite of these themes, the movie never seems to get ""preachy"" which is a good thing.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A6LUXI8I8BU6P	"D Strick ""Entertainment D"""	"I do believe that watching the Firefly series first will help but you don't have to.  By way of testimonial though I actually watched Serenity first and liked it enough that I then watched the whole Firefly series so that should be an indication of how good it is I hope.Firefly was an amazing series that wove, cool concepts, giant glactic govenment, rebles, smugglers, awesome characters, interesting mysteries, violence and peace all together to come up with probably one of the most original sci-fi concepts around.  Its cancelation was a kick in the sack to its fans and kind of makes us late takers cry on the inside.The movie gave us the crew of Serenity again with a slightly bigger budget, cool story, and was a way for Joss to tie up some of the loose ends in the series.  Although they would have been so much more if he could of done it over the course of, oh say, Season 2! Oh well.The movie itself ties up one of the main mysteries of the series, that of, ""What's up with River?""  It leaves other open though, such as what the Sheppard's real back ground is.  Maybe well find out one day.  Cross your fingers.While the movie itself and the final outcome may not have been the most original, its still wrapped around an excellent cast and concept that, if you've seen the series, you care about.  If you haven't seen the series it may peak you interest enough that you'll want to as in my case.  We're also treated to some new characters, one really cool, the other, not so much.We got you're space fights, fist fights, gun fights and sword fights with a little martial arts too so no lacking of action.

Serenity bombed at the box office but for the people who have seen it, they can be divided into two camps. Fan boys who have an unhealthy fixation with Joss Whedon of all people and the other camp is the general, all purpose hater who despises anything that might be remotely different from the status quo. Allow me to be the voice of reason as I am not of either camp, not a Whedon fan, nor a hater.No one can possibly claim Serenity is off the beaten path, unique or should enjoy cult-like status, this movie is a highly predictable space adventure of the kind you've seen or heard countless times before. What makes this movie somewhat different is the writer/director Whedon's light touch. Whedon has certainly seen too many westerns and sci-fi movies, he's read too many adventure novels and comic books and he's seen countless hours of television and been the producer of countless hours of television. Whedon knows what he's about, he's ironic, he's smart and in Serenity he shows himself a capable director.Serenity is very breezy, tongue in cheek, full of humor, sharp as a knife dialogue and even dramatic at the appropriate places. In it's own way, this film is more satisfying than Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. I still have reservations about Serenity because the final act is somewhat cliche ridden, we know at least one of the crew has to die for instance. It devolves into a terrific made for cable TV movie in the last half hour, like a cheesy sci-fi channel flick with a big budget. Don't take those words too harshly, as Serenity is still very entertaining and will quench your thirst for a decent sci-fi movie, just don't expect anything on the caliber of Blade Runner and you'll have a pleasant experience.	3.0	The Sci-Fi  Film That Has Divided the Nation!	2006-01-01	35	9	26

While Mal and River are the main characters in the film the others do get a chance to shine, although I would have liked to see more of the lovely Inara.  Jayne did get some classic Firefly lines (""gee, wouldn't it be nice to have some grenades right about now!"", ""you can never have enough guns"")that helped liven things up.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3GGI20M1C9VKE	E. B. Bjarnason	The first ridiculous scene is during the descend on a planet in order to commit robbery. To begin with the spaceship was not challenged in any fashion by a traffic control, but today an airoplane simply can't fly between plases without being challenged by traffic controllers several times. But apparently in the future, nobody is interested in air and space traffic. That becomes even stranger, as this supposedly happens where there is lack of freedom and the regime is opressive, but such regimes are preciselly the ones that tend to police everywhere. Yet, no-one did pay any attension to theyr arrival apparently.The captain approaches the planetary athmosphere at something like 40.000 km/h (but as every world in this story happens for some magical reason to have got a 1G gravity field approach speeds should be the same as for the Earth. That means the same minimum orbital speed of mac 24. Spaceships approaching the Earth therefore will have got that speed + plus theyr approach speed to the planet). As the descend is about to begin, the captain tells into the intercom that the main heatshield of the ship has just been lost. That means in plane language that the ship and its crew are doomed. The intense heat of entry will burn through the unprotected fuselage, the crew subsequently being fried alife, the ship at some point during the descend braking apart somewhat like one of the spaceshuttles did not such a long time ago. In the future though, perhaps, spaceships will be capable of great amount of acceleration, so perhaps in such an absolute emergency the captain might be able to redline the engines in order to quickly slow down beneath the dangerous speeds that do cause such the intense friction temperatures. However that would mean pulling in lots and lots of Gs. However during deceleration from the extremelly high entry speeds when everyone ought to have been plane unable to move from theyr acceleration coutches due to the intense G levels, the crew was a) not in acceleration coutches and b) was freely moving about the ship corridors like they were inside an oceanic cruise liner, not a rapidly decelerating spaceship and c) not one looked desperatelly worried even though they were all planely in very dire straits indeed.What resulted was a somewhat boring scene instead of what could have been a highly exciting one.Later they were chased by some reapers. They flew something which looked somewhat like a badly welded pickup bed and they were chased by something which looked somewhat like some of the chase veicles in Mad Max 1 or Mad Max 2, except that Mel Gibson's movies were far better and happened on Planet Earth, and the raw and ready looks had actually business being there. The weapons also looked somewhat similar to those used in the Mad Max movies, i.e projectile weapons incluting even a harpoon, so no futureistic weapons in the future eh.The spaceship itself was completelly unairodynamic in outlook. Well, while spaceships do not strichtly speeking require airodynamics in space, the type which is designed to operate in air as well as in space most definitelly needs airodynamics. The podded engines, f.e., would inevitably have burned off during descend.Well, this is just during the first 15 minutes of the movie. I could go on like this for several pages. This is simply by far the worst space movie I have ever seen. It is not just badly made, terribly acted, it isn't even stupit in the right manner; meaning sometimes movies are so bad they become funny for that reason. It does not even manage that.I would rate it 0, but the site does not allow that.Einar	1.0	One of the worst science fiction movies of all time	2006-01-24	163	8	155

The preacher, alone, had so much character developement possibilies worked up; I just could not understand how this could have even entered Wedon's mind. Unabelievable!!! Then Wash gets it!!!! You gotta' be friggin' kidin' me. UN-FRIGGIN'-BELIEVABLE!!!! Ok, let's just create a cast of characters that all work together like no other large cast and start killing them off in the movie based on the series. Now, seeing what heppened in the movie, I, SERIOUSLY, would not be suprised if Wedon kills the rest of them off in the next movies, that is if the series fans can stomach another movie like this one to make it financially possible. As a stand-alone film, it was great. As a continuation of the series, it was a huge mistake to do what Wedon did.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A34GZPHWYPSY2T	"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry"""	"SERENITY (2005, 119 minutes, Writ./Dir. Joss Whedon) is one of the best sci-fi goofball future universe films I have ever seen, this side ofIce Pirates. It was fun, had exactly one swear word and virtually no sex - but lots of fun, innuendo that hit the spot and a very moving, rousing conclusion. The swashbuckling is the best I've seen since STAR WARS. Even the opening credits are a credit to opening credits!This appears to be set circa the year 2500. As far as I can tell, the crew of the Serenity - all salty ex-warriors in a rebellion (a special battalion known as ""Browncoats"") against the evil totalitarian Alliance - are kind of a fun, silly version of the original crew fromAlien. The captain, a former Browncoat apparently turned mercenary - finds himself harboring his doctor's psychic sister. If you're lost or confused, welcome to the world of SERENITY.Throw in an assassin agent (the outstanding yet chameleonic Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's hunting the psychic girl and you have an adventure to end all adventures. If they had thrown in more aliens this would have been right on par withJohn Carter(see my review). The special effects are literally the best I have ever witnessed, like I was really there with those people, the story, though a bit SyFy-film-of-the-month in nature, was compelling.My only complaints aside from not knowing any of the backstory is that the film was a tad clunky and amateurish in an odd way. Whether stylized bad acting at certain moments or the teen-minded arc of the plot, it lacked a certain maturity - but I can live with that when everything else is so good. Even the soundtrack was perfect. Not John Williams, but it was perfect.How did I alight on this film?Countless people had begged me to watch the ill-fated, two-season TV series ""Firefly"" (Firefly: The Complete Series). I never did because I wasn't too interested. Anyway when I went to look for it the thing had vanished at the time. ""Firefly"" was gone. So, I'd heard of this SERENITY film for years, and had been told it was the conclusion of the ""Firefly"" series, which Whedon had done to satisfy fans who are also known as ""Browncoats"". That is how I closed the circuit - I was looking for a brown coat on the internet one day. I ran across a photo of the captain of SERENITY in his brown coat.Plus I found and bought two dandy brown coats for myself. Weird how these things happen. In any case, the series is long dead (from what little I know), the film obviously never engendered a sequel, and I am still endeavoring to discover why the English in this is mid-18th century in nature and why everyone speaks in perfect Chinese half the time. My understanding is the Americans and the Chinese resolved their differences to get to space together, and I have to admit that is how a bilingual 'biculture' is born.These guys also read/write in Chinese as well as English, eat Chinese food and drink tea.Also I'd like to know their martial arts history and why they all seem to know some form of art. Finally, I wonder why there are Buddhists, Christians, one Jewish kid and apparently nothing else in the way of religions. I liked what I assume is the Christian pastor's title, ""Shepherd"", and I may adopt that. Being a Buddhist priest, I wondered why SERENITY has none - or rabbis for that matter.  All these things really make a stand-alone film, yet despite that I understand SERENITY won critical acclaim as the best film adapted from a TV series.Perhaps some fan will post under my review and tell me some stuff. Or else I can buy the series and discover it the painful way. No matter what the heck I do, don't you worry about what or how, I suggest you get this fantastic, rousing film and watch the father of all these recent sci-fi-outer-space TV series. If you got fed up with Galactica as fast as I did, check this out and see how it SHOULD be done! I just reviewedThe Hunger Games...

My main disappointment with the film was that it doesn't use the beautiful Firefly series theme song at all. I bought the DVD as soon as I saw it was out. I gotta say, it's a disappointing DVD package. The front cover is so shiny (and not in the Firefly vernacular way) and features an unflattering picture of River way, way too big (the movie, need I repeat, is about Mal). There is NO paper collateral in the DVD--nothing but an ad for Battlestar Galactica. Nothing! I was amazed. There are copious special features on the DVD, but the packaging makes this genuine release look like a bootleg.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A18F0EOII9UDIM	Elspeth Fahey	"There is an old joke in which a minor player in a production of Hamlet was asked what the play was about and he replies, ""Well, it's about this gravedigger...""What Serenity was all about, ultimately, was the director, Joss Whedon. At the end of the day he is the great continuous link to every stage of filmmaking - writing, directing, art direction and editing as well as where the buck finally stops with the producer. I suspect that in his secret heart he placed a small shroud over the place where the 1992 film of Buffy the Vampire Slayer rested, vowing to return to the cinema once again, this time to Do It Right.Based on the short-lived television programme Firefly, Serenity picks up more or less where the series ended, though the difficulties inherent in capturing the interest of and speaking with respect to both newcomers as well as established fans causes ineradicable cracks in the structure of the film. The normally wonderful characters are not showcased so much as swamped by the sound and fury of what was designed to be a blockbuster motion picture event. The gravitational pull exerted by attempting to make the money people happy is not the ideal arena for Joss Whedon's talents to surface. I know what he is capable of - I have seen all his work that is available on DVD - and all I can assume is that in his haste to return to the big screen - along with the time and money constraints placed upon him by the studio - he was overwhelmed at last. In a way I suspect that he thought this was his one shot at the big time, which is a shame because the film suffers for it.After I saw Serenity I went back and viewed the first three episodes of Firefly. I wondered if I was mistaken in my first impression of the television show and was relieved to find that I was not - it was a wonderful series, full of light and colour and texture, warmth and terror and humour as well as fantastic, skillfully-realised characters. The cast consistently shone through and beyond the special effects and the series enjoyed a deft and refreshing art direction, marrying the cultures of east and west under the overarching theme of pioneering a new life as independent entities. In comparison, the film Serenity was corporate product helmed by a director clearly under stress to keep everyone happy, though in Whedon's defense, I honestly don't see how it could have been acccomplished otherwise. In the greater scheme of things, Firefly had a relatively small following and the structure of an entire film based on the slender plinth of few fans and fewer episodes was bound to wobble a bit.The television series was essentially an ensemble - and was better for it. The decision to make Serenity almost entirely about River Tam could be seen as a serious, even crippling, liability. Even when not in first-person narrative, having a mentally unstable protagonist puts a serious limitation on the number of people who can relate to that character. Sympathise with, perhaps, but not actually identify with, which is the primary duty of a protagonist.On the plus side, the editing is superb - crackling crisply where it needs to and lovingly lingering where it is called for in the quiet moments. From scene to scene, the lighting design is inspired and enhances the story in subtle but definitive ways, fluently describing the language of visual emotion. Summer Glau is astonishing as River Tam, never tiresomely mad like some on-screen portrayals of un-hinged-ness and it is a pure joy to watch her move. She fights with the effortless grace of a person with their soul on fire. Adam Baldwin is once again simply splendid as Jayne Cobb, casting sardonic asides with the simple conviction of the devoutly cynical.Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcom Reynolds - the natural choice for protagonist in the television series - not only goes very dark in the film, he sits right down, and for the most part, stays there. He tends to pick his battles for very private reasons -  some might say too private - since where and when he chooses to make his St Crispin's Day stand is never clearly realised nor adequately explained by the screenplay. It is a very nice speech for all that. The surpassingly lovely Gina Torres as Zoe and Alan Tudyk as Wash are only fleetingly allowed to do what they do best, love each other, and Gina Torres' usual role as Mal's right hand seems in the film to be truncated into an afterthought, which is a shame since no one sells conviction and purpose like the wonderful Gina Torres.Morena Baccarin as Inara, Ron Glass as Shepherd Book, Sean Maher as Simon Tam and the sparkling Jewel Staite as Kaylee are reduced to mere ciphers by the screenplay. This is also a sadness since the strength and charm and beauty of the series was structured in a way to both showcase and dovetail the quirks, passions, flaws and desires of each character, and all in a way that made the whole much greater than the sum of its parts.At the end of the film, after all the kicking, fighting, fleeing and imaginative bi-lingual cussing are done, the Ultimate Bad Guy calmly and in no uncertain terms tells the Flawed But Hopefully Well-Meaning Good Guy that everything he's just spent the past 119 minutes (of my life)  trying to accomplish is completely and utterly futile and that it won't even make a dent in the larger scheme of things. Why does this make me so sad? Because when a great story is told, a viewer invests something of themselves in that story and they deserve to come away with a sense that this investment was worth...something.I have obviously given this film way too much thought, so will bring this stream-of-consciousness natter to a close, but before I do I would like to mention the tenth character, the ship Serenity itself. In the film it seems to completely transcend the typical film set to become a place which lives and breathes in its own right. In two astonishing takes and one invisible edit, the viewer is granted a tour of the interior which through some strange visual alchemy appears to indeed be a place worth dying to protect. And worth living for in order to journey on. If you see Serenity, see it for the ship. It really is the ideal home and a truly fitting character to name the film after."	3.0	It's about this gravedigger...	2006-03-25	35	28	7

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	"I watched the TV seriesFirefly. I admit I liked it, but didn't become a hardcore fan. I was looking forward toSerenity, the movie I thought would wrap up many of the TV show's loose ends. Unfortunately, the movie seems to have suffered in the hands of ""Hollywood"".Where the TV showFireflyfocused on low-key character development,Serenityis nearly indistinguishable from most big-budget sci-fi/action flicks. The film focuses on one of the more villains from the show: the Reavers, a group of space zombies. At least in the TV show, when we didn't ever actually see the Reavers, our imagination could fill in the blanks and thus magnify the horror. On screen, they're just B-movie zombies. A good portion of the movie features fight scenes between the crew and Reavers that go on way too long. Not what I expected from such a character-driven sci-fi franchise.I remember watching the TV show thinking that there are so many possibilities for River and the only way they could mess up the mystery surrounding her character would be to reveal that she was part of a secret weapons program. And, sadly, in Serenity the Alliance experiments on River are revealed to be a part of a secret weapons program. So, River was trained to be a super-soldier. As if that isn't the oldest sci-fi cliche in the book! Utterly disappointing. River was such an interesting character that I'd really hoped for something more exciting from her character.Finally, there were several pointless deaths of some of the principal characters. I won't spoil it by revealing who dies, but none of their deaths were particularly memorable or did much to drive the story along. Several other characters fall by the wayside, including the Companion Inara Serra, who rejoins Serenity briefly but doesn't do much after that. The ensemble that worked so well on TV often became the Nathan Fillion show on the big screen.Overall, I just got the sense that Universal thought Serenity would do better by appealing to teenage boys and throwing in a lot of battle scenes. It's a shame because there's a lot that I like about the movie. The production values, special effects, and acting are all much better than anything seen in the TV show. There's a gem of an interesting philosophical idea when the Firefly crew uncovers the mystery, but it's thrown out there in a heavy-handed way for a few moments before going back to more fight scenes. Given that there probably won't ever be another Firefly movie, this is a somewhat lackluster end for the franchise.Overall, 2.5 starsUPDATE (2/21/13): I rewatched the movie again and think I was a bit too harsh. While I don't think the movie lives up to the glory of the original show, nor is it a bomb. In fact, it does explore several subtle philosophical themes about government control over society and the many aspects of faith. I could have done with fewer Reavers and more characters, but I also appreciate that the Reavers play a more central role to the story than ""just"" mindless ghouls.Overall: 3.5, rounded down to 3 stars."	3.0	Hollywoodization of Firefly	2012-12-06	1	1	0

I love this movie, as well as the series, and part of my motivation for buying this disc (which I already had in the regular DVD release) was to bolster support for the resurrection of the franchise. If we can show that the fans are out there, perhaps some network will pick it up and give us more episodes of Firefly (or Serenity, or whatever they decide to call a new show!) It happened once before, after all...Star Trek was a failed TV show that got resurrected becuse the fans wouldn't quit asking for more.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1	"Eric E. Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'"""	For those of us who have enjoyed Firefly, we left the series yearning for a few key answers. The plot of Serenity picks up a few months, it seems, after the end of the series. We quickly see that River is serving as the voice of the film and we watch from her eyes as things go from complicated, to disturbing and then downright terrifying. No spoilers here, but for my money, the film answers all the questions you might have had lingering.If you are still left wanting, there's a few graphic novels and a role-playing game that share this 'verse.The film was gorgeous on DVD format, and on Blu-Ray, it sweeps through scenes in details some viewers may have missed. And the sound in 5.1 systems was impressive in DVD format, but there are a few scenes that ratchet up better than the DVD (at least, that's how it sounds to me). The special features are incredible, including a few 'sessions' as River experienced at the hand of the Alliance. The bulk of these features are included on the special edition of the DVD, but the Blu-Ray includes a few U-Control tidbits not seen before.And for non-fans watching the film for the first time, watch it with subtitles on. That way you can catch the lightning-like banter at the start of the film. That alone tells you everything you need to know about the background. I would also suggest that if you were contemplating upgrading to the Blu-Ray, to do so with expedience. This is one you won't regret.	5.0	"""Love, and point of fact, something a great deal more dangerous..."""	2011-08-01	3	3	0

You have your western, sci-fi, survival horror, thriller, action, romance, drama, and definitely comedy.Serenity is the continuation of the TV Series Firefly which only aired 11 episodes on Fox. One does not need to watch the show but if one does you'll be rewarded with a deeper sense of the characters and would care if anything happens to them (and you will).The conclusion is more than satisfying and surprising.

Under the leadership of Malcolm Reynolds, a renegade who fought against the new unified central government (the ""Alliance""), the crew of the Firefly-class vessel Serenity struggles to survive any way they can. They fly between the border planets to keep away from the Alliance and below its radar.""So you haven't watched the tv series Firefly? No biggie. You can jump right in to this great flick without the pre-knowledge of each of the characters and enjoy it all the same (though the enjoyment is multiplied for fans of the show).Characters: We have depth to characters here, no one-dimensional action heroes. Everyone has a different motivation and nothing is cliche that I can think of off the top of my headPlot: This is a wrap up to the series in some regards but also makes it so a new series can take off at any given point. The story is more functional in giving us background on the Alliance, River & Simon Tam and Reavers. . .all of which were a big boon and highly appreciated.Setting: You got to love the western/sci-fi feel of this flick. It makes it adventureous and a sense of discover because we finally break from the traditional Star Trek and Star Wars worlds that have been overly exploited over the years. I actually appreciate there are no ""alien humunoids"" in this movie/show.Action: The trailer made me wince thinking the fight scenes were going to be pretty weak, but with the right direction and great acting the fight scenes were welcomed.Special Effects: Taking the same great special effects applied to the series and uping things a knotch the visual eye candy is handled well, but neither does it detract or add too much to the movie. It was just the right balance to be functional, attractive and keep us focused on the story and characters.OVERALL: I was greatly impressed with this movie and will own it when it comes out in a few weeks. It stands alone as a great addition to any movie collection or a wonderful addition to anyone who already ownes the series. Watch it on the big screen if you still can then run out and buy it.

The way the movie was written, there is almost no way they could bring back the show- which is probably a factor in why they didn't.  I introduced my wife to Firefly, and she loved it, but wouldn't talk to me for a couple hours after Serenity because now it will change how she remembers it- instead of everyone continuing to go off on missions, the absence of those characters drags you down a bit.If they hadn't killed off a couple main characters, perhaps they could have relaunched the series once enough momentum had been gained... and delved into more back-story about the characters (including those killed) but, a few years on now, it's obvious that it isn't meant to be and Firefly will remain a cult-classic.  One of the best, and shortest lived series of all time, but without much possibility of ever being dusted off for continuation.Disappointment at the death of those characters aside, it was a great movie, and even their deaths add a gritty ""realism"" where everyone is used to the episodic formula where everyone goes off on a perilous adventure and everyone (with the exception of the red-shirts) survives for a new adventure.  On dangerous missions, not everyone comes home alive (But Gorram it, why not?).Firefly/Serenity, once you see it all, pulls you in and leaves you starved for more that will never come, but all in all, it's Shiny."	4.0	Great but... not 100% Shiny	2009-06-26	1	0	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ACIPGOAQT8ZHS	Faeriechilde	"First off, I highly recommend the widescreen version of this DVD over the full screen.  When Joss Whedon created the world of Firefly and Serenity, he designed it specifically to be viewed in widescreen (both the TV show and the movie), so to watch it any other way means that you won't be seeing it as the director intended.This DVD also has a neat little Easter Egg buried inside.  On the main menu, if you highlight ""Play"" and hit left, you will highlight a marker on the right side of the menu.  Hit enter, and you'll get to watch a short clip about the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial (what River was watching before she went all fight happy the first time).The movie itself is wonderful, for both fans of Firefly and people who have never seen the series, and I think the DVD has some nice extras that make it well worth the purchase."	5.0	Nice little extra	2006-02-03	9	8	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2F37YRZBSSOEZ	"faeryflower ""Meghan"""	"Serenity is the movie spin-off of the much loved Firefly TV series, which was canceled mid season due to Fox's stupidity.The film takes its name from the ship, Serenity, which is a Firefly class transport. Her crew will take on any job, as long as it pays. She is captained by Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion)who fought on the losing side of a civil war. First Mate Zoe (Gina Torres) fought alongside Mal in the war. Wash (Alan Tudyk) is the charismatic pilot, and Zoe's husband. Rounding out the crew is the chipper mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite), a more than able mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin), a doctor, Simon (Sean Maher), and his unstable sister River (Summer Glau).Simon and River are on the run from the totalitarian government, the Alliance. The Alliance had been preforming heinous experiments on River and Simon manages to get her back. Not willing to let their prize go, and concerned she may have gleaned top secret information, the Alliance sends an Operative to retrieve River and Simon. In the first scene you see to what lengths the Operative will go to achieve his mission.Mal is mainly concerned with keeping his crew safe and fed, which becomes increasingly harder as the Operative closes in on his prey. The longer they run, the more obvious it becomes that River has many secrets that even she doesn't know, hidden under layers of psychosis.  And then there are the Reavers, a group of cannibalistic killers who rape and murder all along the raggedy edge of space to deal with. Serenity and her crew are in for one helluva ride!Serenity has what makes any film great, real characters, great action, laugh out loud humour, thrilling heroics, and an ending that, well, you just have to see! This is what the new Star Wars should have been. I hope you took notes George.Joss Whedon's gift of storytelling is at its best here. Serenity will surprise and astonish you, make you jump, gasp, laugh and cry all at the same moment, and it will leave you with that feeling that only a great film can give you. You know that feeling of ""this movie just ended, but I don't want to leave yet. I want to see it again, and keep these characters with me for a long time."""	5.0	Best Sci-fi, EVER!!	2005-11-01	30	28	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1URFEZGGON9E1	Fat_Cobra	"What an incredibly fun movie.  I did have my doubts at first, as that I'd heard it was based on a canceled tv series.  I expected something that felt like a cheap made-for-tv movie, but from the moment that, during a landing, the spaceship captain took the intercom and said to his passengers, ""We may experience some slight turbulence...and then explode,"" I was hooked.  Great writing.  Great cast.  Great dialogue.  Great plot.  The fight scenes were just great--unlike a lot of recent movies, the camera didn't zoom in and out chaotically so as to make low-budget fighting seem fancier than it was.  Apparently the actress who did two of the best fights is a dancer--I've seen a lot of Kung Fu movies, but her style was interesting and unique.  It was so graceful it really looked like she was dancing at times.  Very fun to watch.In case you don't know anything about Firefly/Serenity, it's basically a Space Western about a down-on-their-luck group of misfits making a living as thieves/smugglers and anything else they can manage.  They get in over their heads however when the Alliance (the big bad tyrannical government that controls all the planets) sends an operative to hunt them down to retrieve River, a young psychic girl that the Alliance wants back at all costs."	5.0	wow!!	2006-07-15	9	7	2

Great acting, superb writing, great directing, enough special effects for any sci-fi fan. Why didn't sci-fi fans wake up to this movie?? Serenity continues where the Firefly TV show left off. You don't really need the TV series for this movie, but it's good to know the characters and the 'verse that started it all. I'll go ahead and contradict myself: Buy Firefly too!!!!!!I recently purchased the Collector's Edition DVD. The movie itself is the same, but it looks brighter and cleaner. Most importantly, the film has been given a wonderful DTS 5.1 surround sound soundtrack. Now it is complete! The second disc has all the additional info that makes DVD sets so awesome.

For those of you who haven't seen the TV series, please do. The movie becomes more rich because you better understand the characters and their relationships to one another. But Serenity definitely stands well on it's own. Great storytelling, and a cast that gels very well together. And I don't think you have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this movie since the writing is so good.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A38UQYI4V5RVRF	Feral Sirensong	Joss Whedon hit it out of the park in creating the Firefly universe.  An engaging believable storyline, an amazing cast of very talented actors, and writers that just rocked.Joss's characters speak like human beings.  They're mythic, yet they're not.  They have our flaws.  They speak our language.  And you can fully engage with each and every one of them on a personal level.  A combination of fantastic writing and fabulous actors really brings us into this world.  I can't believe FOX so screwed up by moving the TV series all over the 'verse as regards time slot.This is, by far, better than Buffy or Angel.  And I totally adored both of those series.The movie, Serenity, ties up most of the loose ends of the series.  But it is its own movie.  It helps to fully understand the characters and their motivations.  You'll be much more invested if you watch the series first.  However, the movie stands on its own.  A complete story.  The independent, rebellious, aware good guys against the corporate, conformist, AWARE bad guys.  Truly a tale for our time.Love, love, love this.  I've watched it at least four times and expect to watch it at least 30 more times over my lifetime.	5.0	I cannot say enough about this movie or the series that spawned it.	2007-07-23	1	1	0

"Joss Whedon does not let anyone down, including the fans!Thanks Joss & thanks to all the actors who came together to do the movie.  This was a great movie.  Super actions scenes, great dialogue.  The bank robbery - loved it.The lines are hilarious!  Mal is Mal, Jane is Jane, Kaley's herself, the writing and directing was true and funny and as smart as ever.  River's mystery is finally out of the bag.  The villain was superbly villanous, and a ""believer"" in his own cause.  Reevers are scarier than ever.This reminded me of the first Star Wars movie.  It had it all.  Their visit to Miranda also reminded me of some of the old original Star Trek episodes.  Superb twists in Mal's strategies.If I had any complaints, Inara's role was tiny.  Her lines were few.  And Shepherd's mystery is still a mystery.  Everything else rocked.  I hope it goes to number One this weekend."	5.0	Awesome!  Bravo!  Serenity NOW!	2005-10-01	18	17	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AHVSYRYPMD2YT	"Fiona E. Macnaughton ""Evil Overlady"""	I've watched Firefly, the series this movie was based off of. I even have two copies of the boxed set (one for backup). I've also corrupted a few friends with it...But when I saw this movie, my heart was broken.The mystery of Book's real identity before he became a Shepherd is never expanded on. Too much is revealed about the Reavers, and in my opinion the movie focused too much on them. The show was about getting a job, getting paid, mixed with some thought evoking scenarios, which the movie touched on - especially with the crew's regard to River, - but I was hoping for a direct continuation of where the show left off, not several years down the road when the characters have darken and come down to live or die (too much of the latter).It's sad to see it take such a downward spiral (along with Whedon's other favorites Buffy and Angel). The mix of dark, humor , and ingeneous plot twists is still there from the original series, and I do appreciate that, but if I were to watch it again, I'd stop right after Mal rescues Inara, and picture the rest of it myself.My advice: see it in the theater or rent it, then decide.If you happen to be one of those people who likes watching characters die and everything coming down to the nitty-gritty, then this is the movie for you.Personally, I'll stick to my Firefly.	3.0	Tragic...	2005-10-28	41	12	29

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AQ3HSR71Z8P2G	Firefly fan	"I wanted the Region 4 goodies, and this edition has them.  Also, it was nice to have the Tam sessions on disc instead of having to watch them online.  I also love cast commentaries, which the original edition didn't have (I do wish they'd gotten more or all of the main cast on the commentary though -- they don't all have to be in the same room at the same time to do a commentary).  I also wish they'd included more deleted/extended scenes, especially after so much was made of how much had to be cut for the final version of the film, and especially after the Visual Companion included pics of at least one deleted scene that I know many fans would like to see.  And no easter egg?Minor complaints aside, buying this edition was worth it to me for two main reasons: 1) the Region 4 goodies (although I'm confused as to why they weren't included on all regions' versions in the first place), and 2) I'm willing to spend quite a bit of money to get someone, anyone, to continue this universe in some filmed form.  For instance, I would buy Serenity: the Very Very Special Edition, Serenity: the Super-Duper Fabulous Collector's Edition, and Serenity: Nothing New but the Fans' Desperation Might Get Universal's Attention Edition (actually I already bought that last one several times, except they're just called Second Copy, Third Copy, and ""Serenity in HD"".

When I saw Firefly I was blown away and considering my expectations going into it because it was from Joss that's a very high compliment. Then the show got cancelled, Browncoats all over the world were devastated. We loved this story and characters so much that we couldn't accept it ending, luckily for us and everyone else Joss felt the same. Then he gave us Serenity and I again was blown away and trust me that my expectations were even higher this time around.This movie includes many genres and does it well. This movie was definitely worth the wait and I can only hope that we are lucky enough to get more of this wonderful story no matter what form it comes in.

The first thing that catches you is the originality of this story - this is not at all like the earlier versions of the space opera yet it grabs you from the first frame and just keeps going. The whole story with its engaging cast of characters and their chemistry together ensnares the watcher to dive in and join them. I used to be content with the very thin content of the Star Wars series and still watched some of those old Star Trek episodes with Jim Kirk and the green-painted alien women - but not anymore.

Based on these reviews, I decided Serenity had to be either the greatest thing since ""The Matrix"", or the worst piece of dreck since Hollywood mangled Michael Crichton's great novel, ""Timeline"".So I offered my greenbacks as a sacrifice to the almighty blue & yellow regurged-movie god to see for myself.  Well, it's neither 5-star slobber-worthy nor 1-star venom-worthy(though the Amazon 5-stars DO weigh in at a healthy 77% of the ratings).All of that jibber-jabber to get to this:IMHO, ""Serenity"" was a VERY GOOD, refreshing, 4-star movie on the Amazon scale and an ""A-"" on the Yahoo scale.  Here's what I liked about the movie:1. The MAIN characters were not cookie-cutter, two-dimensional, morally-unambiguous ""good-guys"" & ""bad guys"".  The crew of Serenity(namely Captain Mal) often had to do some morally questionable things just to survive, which rings so true in this morally ambiguous world of ours.  How utterly refreshing to see fictional characters behave the way ""real"" people do.2. That everyone spoke, well, mostly sweared, in Chinese.  The merging of Eatern and Western cultures made this fictional future/universe as intriguing as ""Blade Runner"".3. The well-written, witty, and perfectly timed-dialog, perfectly executed by a top-notch cast of actors I'd never heard of, who obviously were enjoying the parts they were playing.  Damn refreshing to see genuine actors enjoying and appreciating their craft instead of a bunch of cause-addicted egomaniacs going through the motions for the sake of an inflated paycheck.4. The ship, Serenity, had that cool Millenium-Falcon thing going for it.  Everything felt real on that ship, wires hanging out, cluttered bridge, grimy engine room and a cute mechanic with actual engine smudge on her.  And the ship just looked cool, especially in the opening and ending sequences.5. The Parliament's ""Operative"", another refreshing character.  This guy was calm, calculating, and truly believed that he was working for the greater good and the end justified his means.  He definitely was NOT the greedy/power-hungry/dark-side-of-the-force cliche I'm so tired of seeing.  The ""fall on your sword"" scene in the teaser was just brilliant and really defined his character for the whole movie.What I DIDN'T like about ""Serenity"":1. The ""Mr. Universe"" character.  He was likeable enough, but just seemed like a plot-driven device in what was(to me) a character-driven film.  He was probably the one cliched character in the movie, basically filling the roll of the know-it-all computer-geek that gets the writers out of a jam.2. The ""Reavers"" seemed a little 2-D to me, and made the ending a little too ""Dawn of the Dead"" for my sci fi tastes.  There was some serious logic holes regarding their existence too.3. Not enough backstory on the preacher(?) and the gorgeous love interest of Captain Mal.  I watched the deleted scenes and think some of the scenes with her should have been left in.  Not just for her incredibly hot looks, but to better define her relationship with the captain.  The studio release of the film made her character look like a ""generic love-interest for the sake of having a love interest"" type character.  The preacher just seemed like a generic ""I am the older and wiser one that everyone respects for no apparent reason"" character.  I hope there is a director's cut released someday that will do these characters a little justice.Overall though, I really liked the movie and I'm going to buy it because it definitely has replay value, may even look at the tv series that spawned the film.I think I see why some folks rave about the movie, it was very entertaining and yes, Ill say it again, REFRESHING.  It wasn't Matrix-good, but certainly beat the snot out of the crap like ""War of the Worlds"" that 2005 had to offer.As for the venemous 1 and 2-star reviewers, well I'm not sure what to think of these people.  The best they can offer is generic, uninspired ""it was boring"" type comments and an almost anti-fanboy like zeal to trash what was a very good movie.  (I suspect these folks LOVED ""War of the Worlds"")  Perhaps someone needs to slip a ridilin mickey in their Mr. Pibb when the next decent movie comes out.Anyway, rent and/or buy ""Serenity"",  It's a good movie and I look forward to seeing a sequel.End of long-winded review."	4.0	A Non-Fanboy, Non-Anti-Fanboy Review	2006-03-22	9	7	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A21Q29J3ZWPDNP	From Detroit	I purchased the series on DVD and watched it for the first time just a few weeks ago.  Upon completion, I went out and immediately bought this!  It's basically a long episode...  The characters are all there, and complete with a great story (unfortunately, Shepard Book didn't have a big roll in the movie.)  Through out the series, River had very little to do with the show.  She was there, and she had an interesting back-story, but only a few episodes really involved her.  I was really pleased that they put the spot-light on her in this film.	5.0	Awesome!	2007-10-28	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1OZFMJ2AD2R41	Furiae	"The reason Serenity didn't do well in theaters had nothing to do with the movie itself.  The cast was superb, each actor seemed born for their part, the script was fantastic, and the story was absolutely inspiring.  The story was warm, funny, and heartbreaking, and there was an amazing amount of depth present in this film.  Joss Whedon's genius was on high display in Serenity.  The film is also highly accessible.  You don't need to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate it.  I brought two of my gal pals to see the movie and both hate science fiction, but both were thoroughly impressed and praised it as a ""really good movie.""  80+% of critics also enjoyed it, which is rare praise for a science fiction film.So, why did Serenity perform poorly at the box office?  Because none of the stars were famous.  There were no headliners.  Combine that with the fact that it's a science fiction ""space opera"" (a description that turns off most people), there was no draw to the movie.The movie is a spin-off of the short-lived series ""Firefly"" (which was some damned good television).  Like most people who watched the series, I approached it with apprehension (sci-fi is *not* my favorite genre).  I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, however, so I thought I'd give Joss Whedon's new series a chance.  I was won over by the third episode, and I almost didn't want to finish my ""Firefly"" DVDs because I knew the show got canceled and I simply didn't want it to end.Lightning struck twice, however, and we were treated to a Firefly movie.  Serenity was everything I had hoped for and more.  I went to see the movie with already-high expectations that I, in my foolishness, thought couldn't be topped.  I was so surprised by the brilliance of the film that I went back for more, and ended up seeing it in theaters three times--that is a huge compliment coming from me, because I generally wait for movies to come out on DVD and rarely visit the theater.Every time I saw Serenity in the theater, the audiences laughed, gasped, and applauded.  The story is engaging, easy to understand, and even easier to appreciate.  Joss Whedon's mastery over the English language translates into a colorful (in a good way) script, and the pace at which the movie unfolds is perfection--believe me, if there were parts of the film that dragged, I would have caught it after three trips to the theater.What separates this film from every other science fiction film is its focus on its characters.  This is a human story, despite it being a sci-fi story.  It's not about space travel, wars between supernaturally gifted forces wielding lightsabers, aliens, and discovering new worlds.  It's focus remains with its central cast.  Joss Whedon's focus has always been on people, and his characters are rich, warm, and three-dimensional.  It doesn't require a huge stretch of the imagination to believe these people might exist.Too much science-fiction has its characters exist to revolve around their fantastic worlds and ideas.  Science-fiction has a tendency to turn off people because of its tendency to be stories about everything but its characters.  It's hollow and hard to follow.  Serenity is just the opposite.  It's a story about the characters, and everything revolves around the main characters.Many critics have described the movie's plot as what would have happened if Star Wars centered around Han Solo.  Indeed, Han Solo was one of the few characters who were more fleshed out and less trapped by their ""role,"" so there is some truth to this.  Mal, Serenity's mercenary captain, does, at times, resemble a crankier, darker Han Solo.  Mal is the perfect anti-hero.Mal is a mercenary who does what he needs to do to keep his ship afloat and his crew together, and he fights in the movie's conflict because he is forced to.  Mal doesn't suffer from pretentions of nobility and has no qualms about running from fights he doesn't need to fight.  However, when the story's antagonist threatens members of his crew and forces Mal to decide between fighting for his people or abandoning crewmembers, Mal chooses the former.  Having fought in the war as a sergeant, the one thing Mal won't do is leave his men.  He is a flawed man with his own code of honor.As fascinating as Mal (who is played by the funny and dashing Nathan Fillion) is, it's River who steals the show.  River is a gifted teenage girl that was once part of a government experiment.  Her off-the-chart IQ attracted the government's attention, and she was made into a secret weapon.  River became a psychic super-soldier, albiet an emotionally and mentally instable one, as a result of having her brain tampered with too many times in too many experiments.  River is played by the beautiful Summer Glau, who brings extraordinary grace to the character.  It was a treat to see Summer Glau's fight scenes, since she's a classically trained ballet dancer.  I'm sure it was intentional, since the character was described as loving dance, but all the fight scenes flowed like a dance.  I have never used the word ""graceful"" to describe a fight scene, but it definitely applies in this case.You'll notice that I haven't gone into the plot too much, because I sincerely don't want to ruin the surprise.  I had never been so swept away by a film like Serenity.  The first time I saw the movie, I knew that it would be a long time before I would encounter another movie that could take me on a ride as wild as the one Serenity inspired.  The film is action packed and the plot is emotionally driven.  This film is a fine example of the perfection that results in a marriage between good action and fine storytelling.I sincerely hope this DVD sells well and that we'll get sequels.  Underworld and Pitch Black bounced back as a result of DVD sales, and I am holding my breath for Serenity 2.  I have never urged readers to buy products in my reviews.  I have always only encouraged and suggested, but this film deserves it--SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's the best film of 2005."	5.0	Good movie--perhaps *too* good	2005-12-08	26	25	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AH2H5B4VBGBKG	"Gabriel S. Carter ""gabriel-ace-carter"""	"Wow.  That's really all I have to say.  Wow.  I had never watched Firefly before, in fact I just don't watch much TV at all these days.  But I saw a quick trailer for Serenity and thought, ""eh, that looks cool, I guess we'll go see it to hold me over until Narnia and King Kong"".  Boy was I shocked when this film rolled.  I was treated with a film that had less than 1/3 the budget of the last star wars, but Serenity was better written, better acted, better paced, and just about anything else you can put after the word ""better"".The one thing that impressed me the most was that the creators of Serenity never seemed to relegate themselves to the typical ""look, it's sci-fi, so just go with it, it's not always gonna make perfect sense"" that so many Star Wars movies and it's clones have fallen into.  Serenity does nothing that it doesn't explain.  For example, at first I assumed (from past movie-going experience) that the ""Reavers"" were the obligatory evil presence with no explanationa and little motivation for being evil.  But I was enthralled when the presence of the reavers was believably and logically explained later on in the film.  Kudos to the filmakers!There are numerous things like this in the film that go so far in truly creating an experience for the filmgoer.  Yes, there is some cheesy dialogue, and more one-liners than you can shake a stick at, but that's Whedon's style (at least I realize now that it is after watching the first few episodes of Firefly).I know I'll be stoned for saying this, but I honestly believe that Serenity is a better movie than any of the 6 Star Wars films.  Granted, Star Wars has a certain appeal to it because of the cultural significance and the circularity of the movies, but Whedon's storytelling makes George Lucas look like junior high play."	5.0	Top 5 Sci-Fi of all time	2006-01-01	20	19	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A32IW6B3GL0Y2S	Gaius	A few months ago I was introduced to the failed TV series Firefly. At first I was very leery of it because it sounded like a hokey b-movie thing, and frankly it having been made by the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was not a really good recommendation for me. I looked in while my roommate was watching an episode, and was hooked before the first 10 minutes were over. I then borrowed the whole series and devoured them. After watching I found out about the upcoming Serenity movie that was a continuation of that series.Fast-forward 5 months of anticipation, punctuated by occasional tidbits of information from those that had seen it in prescreenings.Sep 30 came and I, and many of my friends were waiting for the theater to open.This film was everything I could have hoped it would be. It was fabulous for old fans of the series, and also great fun for those that were new to the story. It was by turns, funny, exciting, and shocking. This film has heart on a scale that I rarely see.The characters seemed like people you might actually meet somewhere, and the villain was scary enough to make you believe him. This is not some SFX bonanza. There is just enough SFX to make you believe the environment might just exist, and the cinematography is wonderful. The movie starts with a minutes long continuous take that shows the scope of the ship, and many of the principle players.If you like Sci-fi at all give this one a shot. I seriously doubt you will be disappointed.	5.0	The future is worth fighting for!	2005-11-07	13	13	0

To my surprise, Serenity proved to be one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  It has great acting, plot, characters, etc.If you enjoy the movie, you should definitely pick up the Firefly DVD set (the TV series that started it all).

If you love the TV series `Firefly', but haven't seen this movie, you are really missing something. The story is truly and simply amazing.

I would expect &#34;spectacular&#34; to be along the lines of &#34;Scanners&#34; - heads blowing up, psycho-kinesis - that sort of thing.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A35ORINHJSUI2E	Gavin Zimmerman	Like every nerd dreamed about for 2 years, Joss Whedon&#8217;s science-fiction TV series, Firefly (2002), finally has a conclusion. Serenity (2005) is the final chapter of the cult classic series with a slightly revamped graphics and answers that the series never gave. It finally concludes the cliff hanger ending left for watchers of the series without starting additional seasons. One may think that they won&#8217;t understand the movie at all if they haven&#8217;t seen Firefly, but this is not so. The movie is a great standalone film as well as an addition to the series. Serenity it is a great film because of its unique acting, Wild West-like, futuristic universe, the thought provoking content, and well-designed science fiction essences.The viewer is thrown into a science lab with advanced technology and human experimentation. Here the viewer meets the first two members of the crew, River Tam, a genetically superior girl, and her brother Simon, the crew&#8217;s doctor. After their daring escape the viewer finds  the rest of the crew on their Firefly class transport ship named the Serenity. In addition to River and Simon, the crew run by Captain Malcolm Reynolds includes a mechanic, a pilot, the captain&#8217;s first mate, and a gun slinging mercenary, all characters well known to fans of the series. To fans of the series, it is pleasant to see all of the same characters as were in Firefly, but disappointingly it has all of the same characters as Firefly. Certain actor performances are not as well done as one would hope. However, it could as be said that these almost outlandish actor portrayal represent the eccentric, futuristic universe.Captain Mal and the crew arrive on the next city-like planet inhabited by large amounts of people with bright neon signs backed by depressing buildings and people. Not the bright, bubbly, utopian future as typically pictured. The viewer sees how the oppressive control that the Alliance&#8217;s empire has on the future worlds. It has the feel of the Star Wars universe with the line between good and evil much more difficult to define, which is different than many science fiction films.The science-fiction adventure can easily be compared to the Star Wars franchise and can easily be adored by those who love Star Wars. Han Solo fans specifically, will be instantly drawn to this movie and the main character Captain Malcolm Reynolds who owns a personality and style that is nearly identical to that of Han Solo&#8217;s. Serenity has a large amount of similarities within itself that make it comparable to Star Wars, but it is not a clone. This movie has its own story and universe different than that of Star Wars. It is original but is similar enough for Star Wars fans to delve into.For science-fiction fans or fans of the series Firefly, this is a must see. On the other hand, if you are a fan of neither, I would still suggest you give the movie a shot. Serenity brings great graphics, fun characters, an interesting perspective of the future, and makes one think about the moral decisions you make. Serenity puts your moral decision making to the test asking the question if small &#8220;good&#8221; decisions in the present day are correct or if &#8220;bad&#8221; decisions now are justifiable by the &#8220;good&#8221; outcomes.	5.0	See it.	2013-02-19	0	0	0

She completely and absolutelydominated every scene she was in with a presence and intensity that brought you to that reality.

Yet, unlike a lot of the viewers and reviewers here, I found this film pretty dull. There's an awful lot of dialogue (I was pretty amazed how much dialogue writer/direcotr Joss Whedon could fit in, actually) though it didn't seem to be full of much substance. I didn't find the plot very engaging, and I can't remember enough of it to describe it properly (which hardly ever happens with me). There was action, but I didn't feel it, it just seemed to... happen! There was characters who appeared to be interacting and developing, but I just could get into them at all. I didn't know them at the start, and I didn't know them at the end, just the things they did. There were concepts and sci-fi ideas, but none of them intrigued me really, hardly at all. Meanwhile, my girlfriend fell asleep in the first twenty minutes. That usually says something, I've noticed...Probably live without this one, I thought."	2.0	Serenity Now on DVD	2006-08-27	25	3	22
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	Normally I ramble on and on, but my doing so will be lost on this film, so I'll not bother.  Suffice to say, this is probably my favorite film from last year, and definitely my favorite so-called 'space opera' of all-time.  This is one of those films that has got it all:  Good action, interesting, dynamic and most of all, very likable characters, emotional resonance, lotsa extremely funny dialogue and last but not least, zombies.  Yet, despite it's being a 'fun' movie, it's not with out a darker edge, and it feels more substantiative then most films of this sort.  Nathan Fillion's Mal Reynolds is a classic character.  Yes he's just the outwardly cynical anti-hero who is actually somewhat idealistic at heart archetype, but this is probably my favorite sort of hero, and he plays it as well as anyone ever has.  Chiwetel Elijofor is also especially good as the villainous Operative.  He's another typical character, the cold and polite yet ruthless villain-killer, but he gives the role a bit more depth then it usually has.  Here Whedon wrote a character that reminds us that most 'villains' don't think of themselves as such (Though the Operative, ironically, does) and are still quite human.  The film also deserves credit for just allowing a somewhat novel take on the genre.  This sorta genre has always been associated with westerns, but this is the only instance where I think that the connection has been overt, and I think it's a very effective combination.My only complaint is that even at 2 hours in length the movie seems to end only as it's getting started.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2FYZ8RW15N4PY	Georgina Hinton	A much anticipated film for thousands of Firefly, the tv series,fans and sci-fi/western buffs. Amazing special effects add impact to an already great story. This is a story of real human feelings and morality in an vastly cold and controlled universe. Odds against this small crew of a cargo ship, on the run from the universal authority because of a young girl that Captain Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) has taken under his protection, throws this crew into one mess after another, while only trying to survive and keep this old, piecemeal cargo ship called Serenity flying. All kinds of twists and cultisac's in this action/western/sci-fi/romantic/heart-warming movie, it's wild! We need more of this crew of the cargo ship Serenity, the more times you see it, the more things you didn't see before, that make it a keeper!Great movie for the family, only mild cussing, no nudity, a great lesson in ethics and the value of human freedom!	5.0	Action & Heart	2006-07-25	6	5	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3LFIA97BUU5IE	Get Reel	"To start with, while it's not necessary to watch the Firefly series first, I do think it's very helpful so that you have the correct (or a better) emotional context to enjoy the film. What Firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly, I still marvel at it every time I watch an episode. I knew I was going to love it when the Pilot episode opened with Wash (the ship's pilot) playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a 'heist.'Serenity extends the story and fills in some of the past. The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good and consistent with the series). There is great action. But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special. It's not that the acting is Oscar quality per se, it's that the characters are so real. This is in contrast to the last three Star Wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden, you don't care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter (note that I loved the original trilogy for the same reason as Firefly/Serenity..the way the cast chemistry worked). Humor, anger, angst, sadness...all of them ring true in the way they play off each other.Mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex-soldier who cares for his crew, but tolerates no challenge to his authority (but has a good sense of humor). Ron Glass does a great job as Shepard Book, it's hard not to like Kaylee the engineer and my favorite, tough guy Jayne (Alec Baldwin) who is by far the funniest character (""Uhhhh, I been workin' on a new plan. What say we shoot her first."").At the end of the day, that's what made this film/series so special. The characters are genuine and easy to care about. There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast. Every episode provided good action and comic relief. If I had to use one word to decribe the series/film, it would be ""fun.""I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff. I would rate Firefly/Serenity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride. Don't miss this one!"	5.0	May be the most underrated Sci-Fi film/shows in history...	2006-05-24	9	8	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3LH77PBDFEO3F	"G. E. Williams ""Nunah"""	"I watched Serenity after reading an essay by Orson Scott Card praising it as a sci-fi movie that is the way sci-fi movies should be. I liked it, but didn't get it on a level that I did after watching the series ""Firefly"" on DVD.So it is almost like it is two movies, on one hand it is a satisfying completion to a wonderful series that many people loved, (even those who like me missed it until after the movie), and on the other hand this is a very good allegory of a story about big government, and even a look at the dangers of psycho-pharmacology. And no, I am not against psycho-pharmacology in any way, but I am against the idea of the government having a say in how I choose to or not to medicate.In any case this is a visually stunning film, very well written, very well acted, with completely believable special effects.If you want an excellent sci-fi movie this is it, but do yourself a favor and watch the series first. You'll be glad you did."	5.0	Serenity is two great movies...	2007-05-10	2	1	1

So I passed on the show Firefly when it was on TV and skipped the movie Serenity at the theaters.  When blockbuster was out of the movie I wanted to see, I rented Serenity because it was recommended by some co-workers.  I was hooked.  I now own the Firefly DVD set and both Serenity and Serenity collectors edition.  I was surprised by the depth of the characters and the really fun, quick witted dialog.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3CWLBSGRN7N1W	"Glenn Steinhilber ""gsdrew91"""	"When Gene Roddenberry first pitched his concept for Star Trek to networks execs he presented it as ""a 'Wagon Train' to the stars"".  It is unclear whether Star Trek ever achieved that vision.  However, there is no doubt that Joss Wheedon did succeed when he created the television series ""Firefly"" and the current major motion picture ""Serenity"".The story so far.Five hundred years from now the earth is used up and humanity takes to the stars.  They discover hundreds of planets and moons that they terraform to become new earths.  Some of these planets are ""rich and flush with the new technology; some not so much"".  The Alliance tries to bring all planets under centralized control.There was some disagreement on that point.  A civil war ensued between the Alliance and the Independents. After the war many of the defeated Independents drifted to the outer reaches of the known universe (or simply the 'verse in Firefly-speak)  and they are made to get by with only the most basic of technology.Enter the crew of the cargo ship Serenity, an amiable and good hearted group of outlaws just trying to get by in a screwed up universe, I mean 'verse.The movie opens where the TV shows leaves off.  Simon Tam (Sean Maher) has rescued his sister River (Summer Glau) from the clutches of the Alliance.  You see River is a prodigy and the Alliance has conducted experiments on her in an effort to enhance her abilities which has the side effect of leaving her psychotic.They take refuge on board Serenity but are pursued by an evil agent of the Alliance known only as ""The Operative"", played with icy panache by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  Ejifor's performance is one the best in the film and his is most memorable villain.We are then whisked off on a wild ride to discover the secrets of not only River's psychosis but also the awful truth behind the origins of the cannibalistic sub-humans known as ""The Reavers"".I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Though the special effects are good they are in no way in the class of Star Wars.  However, where Star Wars tends to fall flat in the areas of acting, story and dialogue ""Serenity"" wildly succeeds.  The story is well told and plotted and Wheedon suffuses the whole with moments of whit and humor.  Some of the best comic moments are reserved for engineer Kaylee Frye, played by the incredibly gorgeous Jewell Staite, and tough guy Jayne Cobb, played by the always reliable Adam Baldwin.The entire cast, which is lead by Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcolm Reynolds (think Robin Hood meets Han Solo), reprise their roles without missing a beat. Unlike some of the failed Star Trek movies, Wheedon does an excellent job of utilizing his entire cast in a way that never seems contrived. Each character is given their own unique moment in the film.  Other returning members of the cast include Gina Torres as first mate Zoe Washburn, Alan Turdyk as the pilot simply known as ""Wash"", Ron Glass as the intriguing clergyman Shepherd Book and the exotically beautiful Morena Baccarin as Ambassador Inara Serra.Another reason ""Serenity"" is so successful is the Wheedon resists the temptation to condescend to his audience and does not fall back on tired plot devices.  This leads to some surprising moments, including the deaths of two major characters.  Wheedon also does not succumb to the temptation to provide a romantic moment between Fillion and Baccarin.Fans of the television show should and I think will adore this movie.  It picks up and embellishes on the original episodes and provides a satisfying conclusion should this be the end of the line.  I certainly hope it is not and I have read that the entire cast has signed on for a sequel should ""Serenity"" prove sufficiently successful at the box office.If you have never watched the show before the movie provides enough backstory for you to jump right in and enjoy.  Some of the character bits will not be as meaningful but there is more than enough here for you to enjoy.  So please do all of us ""Firefly"" fans a favor see ""Serenity"" so that there might be a future for this great story and these great characters."	5.0	Serenity NOW!	2005-10-15	13	9	4

Every one of them has come away saying ""what a great movie"".  The reason is not complicated, it's just that with all the big budget effects and action sequences that are part of the standard package these days, we've forgotten how satisfying a movie can be when it has an ensemble of characters we care about and a story which is well written and well acted.  Serenity does have the ""fun factor"" of a rollicking sci-fi adventure yarn, the sort of feel Star Wars used to have, but it also has a depth that leaves you well satisfied and keen to go right back in and see it all again.The DVD extras are a bonus, and whilst I'd like to see more of them, any shortcomings here aren't nearly enough reason to reduce a full 5/5 score for this particular movie."	5.0	Great Series, Great Movie	2005-11-01	26	25	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AZFBJPNG5USEL	G Ninja	The best Sci-Fi I have seen.  Period. I think Universal has to take a chance on making a sequel to Serenity.  The fanbase is continuing to grow and it's quite evident in the DVD and Bluray sales.  Universal gave the green light to spend a $40 budget and they pretty much made that money back with movie tickets and DVD sales.  I'm pretty sure if they decide to shell out another 40 to 50 million for a sequel, they will not be disappointed.  I will be the first one on line for a movie ticket.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AELYA3DZFSG9Q	"gobluegirl ""gobluegirl"""	I was buying this Collector's Edition mostly for the additional features, including a commentary track with more than half of the main actors from Serenity, and some neat featurettes.  However, I was struck by how impressive the packaging was.  It's got this cover which swings open like a book. And the cover art reflects what the show is about much, much better than the original edition.The movie, it really goes without saying, is wonderful. If you've not seen Serenity, this is the edition to buy.  The special features were pretty good, especially the commentary track.The other cool thing is that the Session 416 viral marketing videos were included in this edition. Although they were filmed to be grainy, black-and-white images, there is a surprising amount of additional detail you can see on them on your TV rather than your computer screen. It really adds something to these mini-movies to see some subtleties of acting that weren't visible before.I was a touch dissapointed with some of the other features, if only because they were a bit repetetive.  Some of the footage was used in more than one of the features, especially the feature that ran on the Sci-Fi Channel.  It was spliced together with other, new, footage, and some of the re-worked footage was from a different perspective (like one of the outtakes, for example), but I was hoping to see a bit more new material.All in all, though, a significant improvement in extra features over the original DVD release. Hard core fans, or people who don't have a copy of Serenity yet, will want to get this.  And if you're the type who is holding out for a sequel, like I am, it's also worthwhile to pick up.	4.0	Great addition to your sci-fi collection	2007-08-27	4	4	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3T1LD0C65QCWK	Gordon M. Wagner	"I'm hesitant to criticize this film at all since there is so little worthwhile science fiction being produced these days.This is an interesting film. The FX are impressive. The cinematography is good, the direction is good. I was annoyed by the repeated cut scenes meant to represent River's shattered mental state, suddenly a horrible ""Reiver"" face pops on the screen... BOO! It's a cheap trick, that's not storytelling.In the first ten minutes I found five or six instances that seemed to be ""quotes"" from other science fiction movies. I couldn't decide if that was meant as tribute or imitation.I wish I'd seen the television series. This movie impressed me. It's ambitious, and that much alone makes it worth recommending. The story overall doesn't exactly remain taut, but it's difficult to fault the movie for that, given what it does achieve. It's a really good effort. You care about the characters. The captain of the Serenity is very, very good in his role. The girl that plays River has a creepy sexuality about her that's disturbing... kind of an Angelina Jolie f-me-and-I'll-kill-you vibe.Overall: BUY IT NOW WHILE IT'S STILL AVAILABLE. It may not be perfect, but it's one of the few good science fiction movies produced in the past twenty-five years. It's a gasp of air after the claustrophobic/stale Star Wars-Star Trek franchises have suffocated anything imaginative for the past three or four decades.I wish amazon.com had a four-and-a-half-star rating... it's a very good SF movie."	4.0	Excellent science fiction -- great DVD presentation	2006-08-18	6	6	0

Well, now that I saw it, I'm going to keep the DVD and also use my gift card to buy the firefly DVD set.Good special effects & martial arts action, but I guess I really enjoyed it because of the story & characters.It has some of the Han Solo & STV Tom Paris witty dialogue. You sympathize with the Captain & his crew, especially when some of the main characters die or are near-death. The villain is very sinister, with his perfected assassination techniques and extremist religious beliefs that justify evil actions for the sake of the Alliance (or Empire for all you Star Wars fans out there).	5.0	EXCELLENT	2005-12-26	17	17	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A9YA983MXKCEL	"Gregory Bartz ""Gregorius"""	I just got back from the first showing in my area on opening day. I am proud to report that Serenity is a pretty good movie - not great, just pretty good. It gives the audience a reason to like the characters and care about what happens to them, which is something that all 14 episodes of Firefly completely failed to do. However, it tries to do so by playing the same few cards over and over, and constantly hearing the same old things being said gets tiresome. The story is very tightly told and has many very clever plot points. It also has some noticeable gaps and contrivances for the sake of convenience. The humor, of course, is very much Joss Whedon's uniquely brilliant brand, but as with Firefly, it's not abundant. The action sequences, though cool, aren't very original; one scene felt like a ripoff of the opening space battle in Revenge of the Sith, while the scene where River fights a horde of Reavers was too much like the Smith-Neo brawl in The Matrix Reloaded. Though flawed and sometimes a bit weak, Serenity is never boring, and overall the good things about it outweigh the bad.	3.0	MUCH better than Firefly	2005-09-30	31	5	26

Not being a tv watcher or any kind of ""evangelist"" personality, I just never took the time to watch it.  As a present, I took her to see the special exclusive pre-release screening.The movie blew me away..seriously. It wasn't perfect..what movie is? But sitting here now, I couldn't list those imperfections.  What sticks with you is the epic story line, the powerful character archetypes, the feeling of continuity between the characters.  I didn't know anything about the series before I saw it, and I didn't need to in order to get caught up in the story line.Within a week after seeing it, I saw the entire TV series I'd missed on DVD. Then I went and saw the movie again. Some things were more clear, and some things were more poignant, but I think the movie was great the first time around, too.  I've already pre-ordered the DVD.  I guess you could call me a convert."	4.0	Great movie, even for non fanatics!	2005-11-21	16	16	0

I watched the series ""Firefly"" on DVD, then watched ""Serenity"", thinking the story would flow in that order.  Is it just me or did the movie not continue from where the series ended?  When Simon and River board Serenity in the film it seemed like everyone was treating them as if they'd never met them.  But the rest of the crew knew each other.  So it seemed to me everything except Simon and River was continuing from where the series ended, but they seemed to just ignore that Simon and River had been there all along and introduced them again.  Also Simon saved River from the Alliance at the beginning of the film - that had happened in the first episode or two of the series.  Was the film just a retelling of the story, meant to stand apart from the series?All that said, this is a very smart, way above average sci fi film with outstanding effects.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AUM1ICXFKY7EE	Guinea	This movie is great as a stand-alone film, but it is even better as the final word on the Firefly story (Firefly was a TV series that was cancelled, and the uproar from the watching public caused the actors of the show to produce &#34;Serenity&#34;). Serenity is, in essence, a 2nd and final season of Firefly condensed into a movie.  The crew of the Firefly-class spaceship, the Serenity, are set in a future time, where they are are rebels to the controlling government. They haul freight and some passengers, both legal and not, and probe into the reasons for the govt doing what it does. Fear of the dreaded Reavers, a group of demented and almost zombie-like humans who attack, maul, and eat anyone they come across, is a theme throughout the show, ending with an eye-opening resolution, which I won't spoil here. The characters in this movie are fun and interesting, with a natural chemistry that is what made Firefly so popular. Touches of romance stand shoulder to shoulder with tough guys and high-action battles. The writers for the show came up with fresh and spunky dialog that is laugh-out-loud funny or quirky and sarcastic. Overall, the movie hits multiple genre...it's a drama, but sci fi-fantasy, with romance next to almost wild-west action. It's all the good stuff rolled into one movie.Summary: excellent entertainment for adults, with the freedom from real-life worries present in most dramas, since everything in this story is fantasy. Not for the kiddies....violence and hints of a sexual nature, and the Reavers would be scary to kids.	5.0	Wonderful movie!	2013-04-13	0	0	0

Appartently there weren't enough viewers in the French part of Switzerland, so they are not going to show it in the German part.So this is my chance to finally see the movie, I've waited for sooooo long! As I haven't seen it yet, I cannot really comment on it myself. But from what I've read: it must be spectacular!I would have preferred Firefly (the TV show) getting a lot more seasons over a movie.

Really well developed characters, great dialogue, great story, great acting.  Joss Whedon writes some of the best female characters around.  No idiodic portrayals of a woman dying of a broken heart and leaving her twin babies motherless like someone in a more famous sci-fi movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A20FK68BUB1IVA	Happy Reader	"The movie begins with a narration: ""Earth-That-Was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many. We found a new solar system, dozens of planets and hundreds of moons. Each one terraformed, a process taking decades, to support human life. To be new Earths. The central planets formed The Alliance, ruled by an interplanetary parliament. The Alliance was a beacon of civilization. The savage outer planets were not so enlightened, and refused Alliance control. [At about here, you realize that this is sounding too much like a political ad, or maybe indoctrination. Then, sure enough, you see the speaker, a teacher standing in front of her young charges. She continues:]The war was devastating. But the Alliance's victory over the Independents insured a safer universe. And now, everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of true civilization.""One of the students is the young River Tam. She tells the teacher why the Independents would have rebelled: ""We meddle ... People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do. What to think. Don't run. Don't walk. We're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right.""It's not just the plot and acting of ""Serenity"" that are excellent. It is the way the story is told; how it unfolds. First the disembodied voice, which turns into the teacher, which turns into a memory of the now 17 year-old River the subject of terrible experiments, which turns into an archive video being watched by The Operative. And this all happens before the opening credits!The archive video is of Simon Tam rescuing his little sister, River, from the Alliance laboratory. And now the two are on the run from the Alliance, aboard the Serenity, a Firefly class transport ship. Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds was a Brown Coat, an Independent squashed by the Alliance. Now he's trying to make a living smuggling and salvaging, on the ship he named after the Plains of Serenity, the last great battle of the failed war of independence.It is a hard way to make a living. As Mal tells the unhappy Simon, ""I put this crew together with the promise of work, which the Alliance makes harder every year. Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to ship about at all. This job goes south, there well may not be another. So here's us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you.""The themes of ""Serenity"" are universal, sometimes troubling. The dialogue is snappy. The humor is great and frequently campy. Our first view of the ship Serenity shows it in trouble. The pilot says, ""This landing is going to get pretty interesting.""The Captain looks at him: ""Define interesting.""Pilot: ""Oh God Oh God, we're all going to die?""I saw ""Serenity"" in the movie theater before we even knew of the prequel TV series, ""Firefly"". Now, we have both for home viewing, and I strongly recommend watching the TV series first, if possible. The movie does stand alone and gives you sufficient background. But the experience will be richer if you have seen the TV series first.DVD:Firefly: The Complete SeriesBlu-ray:Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]BONUS EXTRAS on theSerenity [Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy]:To access the digital copy of the movie, you need to download from a Universal Studios site, using the activation code included.

Mr. Universe's Compendium (U-Control on Blu-Ray) This is background and added information on organizations, weaponry and people in the Serenity universe.5.  Alliance Database (Blu-ray)6.  Commentary by writer/director Joss Whedon (DVD) I enjoyed re-watching the movie with Whedon's commentary. Joss talks about needing a villain. ""Somebody who would believe so strongly in what he was doing, that he would do anything. The exact opposite, of course, of the hero. In casting Chiwetel Ejidfor, we found the perfect person because he brings such depth and soulfulness and regret to everything he does.""Whedon says that he likes to cast comedians in drama roles. Comedy, he says, ""is the hard one."" If the actor can do comedy, then they can do drama.7.  Deleted Scenes (17 minutes) Interesting - one deleted scene showed the Operative researching Mal. He finds out that the Battle of Serenity had a 68% casualty rate for the Independents. Soldiers like Mal kept fighting for 2 weeks after the generals surrendered.8.  Outtakes (6 minutes)9.  ""Future History: The Story of Earth That Was"" (10 minutes) Joss Whedon tells how he came up with this version of the future, which is supposed to be 500 years from now. For example, there are two universal languages used, English and Chinese. In Joss's imagined future, these two superpowers merged when Earth set out to colonize.It's also interesting how he ""chose"" his hero: ""I just wanted to tell a story about people who are living in space, but not living in grandeur. And not living in great portent, but were more the fringe people. People that the Enterprise would have blown right past and never noticed.""And the hero's background: ""There's very little American fiction about the people who won the [Civil] war, about the North. The people we all like to be identified with, we're all interested in, is the South, because we love losers.""10.  ""What's in a Firefly"" (10 minutes) Fascinating look at how they worked scenes, such as the mule skip chase scene after the beginning bank robbery. Both CG and visual effects people explain how it was done.11. ""Re-lighting the Firefly"" (25 minutes, from 2005) The story of how Joss Whedon and others pulled together a film to tell the story that was left unfinished in the prematurely cancelled TV series. Commentators include Whedon and most of the ""Firefly"" cast. The most memorable moment was the San Diego ComicCon, after the show's cancellation and before the movie was finished. On the last half of the last day of the convention, 5,000 people showed up to see Josh and the cast.12. Joss Whedon Introdution (6 minutes) This is Whedon's introduction to a draft of the movie (not the final cut).Excellent, excellent film.

This series and subsequent movie are absolute proof that the creativity we have lost in Network TV is still out there, but is being quashed by Network Execs that are undeniably out of touch with its viewers. If the networks do decide to run a series people want to watch they run it for a few months then kill production to run another series all together like its impossible to have two good shows at the same time on the same network or they find ONE good idea and run two more identical shows with only slightly diffrent names. Even Hollywood seems more than happy to churn out remake after remake of 50 year old ideas. Don't get me wrong I enjoy watching giant apes swat airplanes, orange Dodge Chargers flying thru the air and the science it takes to lift a print from a glass as much as the next guy, but if they make it common practice to cancel shows with this much promise because they can't compete with a sports franchise or a show in its fifth year, 50 years from now they will STILL be remaking Giant Apes, orange Dodge Chargers and showing for the 100 millionth time that they can get dna with a cotton swab.I had not heard of the Firefly series until I heard about Serenity since this is on dvd I highly suggest watching both the series and the movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1H8JUI9GNQKNR	Harold Harefoot	"I read several reviews, including some by respected professional critics, when this came out saying that ""Serenity"" was the ""best sci-fi movie ever made"" and I was somewhat skeptical.  I had seen it once at that time and had thought it was indeed very good and that it was certainly better than any of the Star Wars prequels.  But that's like saying filet mignon is better than hamburger.  So I went to see it a couple more times.  Then it clicked.  This movie is so detailed and nuanced that it can only truly be appreciated after multiple viewings.  There's simply too much going on at once, both visually and aurally, to fully grasp the complexity of this film in one sitting.  This, of course, makes it the ideal movie to purchase on dvd.  You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but come to appreciate it more and more each time you see it.  Also, keep an eye on Summer Glau's performance as River Tam - probably won't get an Oscar nomination, but she certainly deserves one."	5.0	Highly Re-watchable	2005-11-07	10	10	0

I'm saddened that the show did not survive Fox's budget cuts but I'm so glad they were able to make this movie. None of the actors disappoint. The only part is that the interplay between the actors is limited as this is a 2hr movie and not a series but in the end the chemistry is there in this movie.  You don't have to watch the Firefly series but it certainly helps.Chiwetal Ejiofor is a nice newcomer here and plays a nice villian. I like to see the range this actor has.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1O5ZM339TXJYV	"HC Grindon ""Movie Lover"""	"If you have SciFi tunnel-vision and can't think outside of the universes created by George Lucas and Gene Roddenberry, i.e. your sci-fi MUST have non-human aliens, ONLY fancy, hi-tech gadgets/weaponry, faster-than-light speed, and every other sci-fi cliche spawned by Star Wars/Star Trek, then Serenity probably isn't for you.However, if you can imagine a future where, well, it's just us humans, and practical folks use what they can to get by, then you'll like ""Serenity"".This is not the pristine and polished Federation of Star Trek or the grand and noble Republic of the Star Wars prequels.  Josh Whedan has created an interesting and practical universe and future for mankind, where people still use six shooters and shotguns because they are (probably) cheap and cost effective.  High tech weapons exist, but are likely expensive and probably controlled and regulated by the government. The rogue crew of Serenity barely scrapes by enough to fill their six shooters, much less afford high tech weapons.I gained a whole new level of respect for this movie when I read somewhere that the budget was only 30-40 million, which is peanuts for big screen scifi.  The special effects certainly weren't groundbreaking, but they were far from cheesy, in fact the FX were pretty darned good.  The lighting in the movie was fantastic and deserved a nod from one of the snotty Hollywood awards programs.I'd never heard of any of the cast, but they did a fine job, especially the guy who played ""Mal"", this guy is going to be big someday.  The dialog was some of the best I've ever heard.  Snappy, witty, and down-right fun.  The whole movie was an interesting mix of funny and serious.  Funny scenes could turn on a dime and suddenly be dramatic, and vice-versa.  This may also turn off mainstream viewers, who tend to want their movies to be strictly comedies, dramas, actions, etc.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Serenity"".  It's certainly worthy of a place in my DVD collection and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fresh, original scifi with a witty twist.I'd also like to see more of this Serenity crew, so I may even buy the Firefly series the movie was based on."	5.0	Think Outside the Star Wars/Star Trek Box	2006-03-07	14	12	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ABEXGYC9NDWQF	"HC Grindon ""Too Many Books"""	"I really can't say enough about this jewel of a movie.  Most of what I love about it has already been said:1) Absolutely fantastic characters that grow on you.2) Incredibly talented cast.3) Top-notch writing.4) Hilarious, witty dialog.5) A unique vision of the future, without all of the tiresome  SciFi cliches.6) Great story & script with a perfect mix of action, drama, and wit.7) Incredible camerawork(a la BSG) that draws you into the film.8) Good FX (despite what the online BDI's say), especially considering this was NOT a big budget film.And this was all BEFORE I experienced the series ""Firefly""!After renting Serenity, I bought & devoured the Firefly DVD's in just a couple of days.  I then bought and re-watched Serenity with a whole new appreciation for the movie and the Firefly universe.Sci-Fi purists that try to compare Serenity to ""typical"" Sci-Fi a la ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"" might be disappointed because Serenity/Firefly is not alien & technology driven, it is extremely character driven.  It's about the crew, their bond with each other, and their daily struggle to survive.Others may have a hard time with the whole Dramedy concept.  Drama and comedy can co-exist, and Serenity/Firefly pull it off seamlessly.I wholeheartedly recommend both Serenity & Firefly and sincerely hope there is an enlightened network out there somewhere(SciFi Channel, WAKE THE HELL UP!) that will put this incredible series back on the air.How I missed it in the first place is beyond me, but I'm on-board now, and completely hooked.You should be too.(BTW, I also recommend the Serenity comic book/graphic novel and the book ""Finding Serenity"", both available on Amazon.  The graphic novel story-line takes place after the end of the series and leads into the movie.

Sure it was light at times but then it would turn around and get so dark, while Serenity is even darker but there's always that little feather floating around in that darkness that is there to tickle you a little and remind you that as bad as it is, it has a chance of being better.	5.0	Serenity	2014-05-24	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3OXYXM50RN25I	"Heather R. Kikkert ""HKikkert"""	First off, I want to warn everyone that I am not going to reveal any of the specific happenings of the movie in this review, because someone will shoot me in my sleep for spoiling it.Although my sister watches many of Whedon's television series, I myself do not. Unfortunately, she is not a big sci-fi outer-space type person, otherwise I would have been an avid `Firefly' fan a lot sooner. I discovered the show on DVD well after it had been canceled, when I was pre-ordering the prematurely canceled `Wonderfalls' series on Amazon. Many of the people who rated Wonderfalls mentioned how FOX had canned their 2 best shows before giving them a fair chance, and named Firefly as the other of FOX's major  bubble follies. This intrigued me, so I read a lot of the Amazon reviews for `Firefly'. After seeing that even though quite a few people gave it 0-1 stars, it still came out on top of 550+ reviews with an astounding 5 stars, so I ordered it as well. I was not disappointed in the least. It started out a bit slow over the first couple of episodes, but what show doesn't while trying to introduce all of their characters and get the plot going without totally confusing the viewers? After the first few episodes, I was totally hooked. The special effects of the series, as well as the movie, might not be up to par with Star Wars, but that combined with the perfect cast members, are what make it all the more realistic and believable. I truly can not decide if I like the show or the movie better, but that's a good thing, isn't it? In my opinion, they are both most excellent.When I first saw the `Serenity' trailer, it appeared that Whedon had remade a lot of the previous tv series so that it was big screen worthy and easier for the audience who had never seen the show to follow, but boy was I wrong. He actually just gave supplemental information from what had already been revealed on the show, which in effect answered all the previously posed questions. Instead of that creating a true ending, I am hoping tying up all of the loose ends gives Joss more flexibility for incorporating new ideas into possible upcoming Serenity flicks. And may there be many more to come.	5.0	Truly Superb!	2005-10-14	11	9	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1CCT0CWK40OL9	heliacal rising	Seriously though...I just figured I'd review Serenity so I could get my five-star rating in, so I'll keep this short and sweet. Buy this movie, along with the Firefly series, on DVD. You will absolutely fall in love with it and DVD sales may help raise the likeliness of future projects. In this movie, along with Firefly (the canceled series it is based on), character development comes first. Flashy special effects always come later, which is what any storyteller should learn (&lt;cough cough> George Lucas prequels). Anyway, I won't go on repeating what everyone else's reviews already say. Watch both Firefly and Serenity and enjoy every single delightful moment.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A17KHFR9IJ8DA	Henderson James	"It boggles the mind that the self medicating masses fell over each other to see ""Doom"", while ignoring this gem. One of the best science fiction films in recent memory, based on the failed TV show ""Firefly"". I guess if it actually 'failed' there wouldn't  have been a film, now would it? Great characters and dialogue that is never seen in SF films for ""today's sophisticated audience"". Am I the only one tired of that subversive phrase? As if to say anything that came before today's CGI SF garbage isn't worth anything. Like ""Stealth"" or ""The Island"" are filmatic events compared to ""2001"", the original ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Forbidden Planet"", etc. Get this when it comes out on DVD.

I am here to say that I feel bad about not having seen the movie in theaters.  Then when I seen how the box office did, I felt real bad.  I would have easily paid to see this movie a couple times at least.  If they ever make a sequel (man I hope they do) I will be there the day it opensAfter seeing the movie I picked up the series and it was great.  This is TV that I would watch.

Prime ""NYPinTA"""	"I loved this movie.I was a big fan of the TV show that it is based on, but in a way I'm jealous of anyone who is going to see the movie that wasn't already familiar with the Firefly universe because as a fan, there were certain things I was looking for and sometimes that can be distracting. The movie is very accessible to anyone who hasn't seen the TV show so if you are concerned that you might get lost because you hadn't seen the show, don't be. See this movie. Trust me.It had fantastic dialogue, great visuals, and gorgeous music.It was beautiful when it needed to be, ugly when necessary, funny, sad, and exciting. It was everything a movie like this should be! And most important (at least for me), it was surprising. Too many movies are so obvious you already know how it will end before it is half over. But not this one.There is a scene where Sheppard Book says to Mal, ""They'll come at you sideways."" Well, Joss does too. He does the unexpected and it just rocks. This isn't a warm and fuzzy action adventure. People are at risk; nothing is sacred, nothing safe. I love that.I even thought to myself more than once, `why couldn't George Lucas do it like this?' I saw Star Wars Episode III and was (sadly) bored to tears by the opening sequence. Never once was I bored with Serenity. I was clutching my seat, gasping in shock along with everyone else in the theater. And when it was over, they audience applauded, in a movie theater. What does that tell you?Also, even as a woman I can say this without jealousy, but Gina Torres is gorgeous in this film. She needs to be in more movies."	5.0	Helluva ride!	2006-01-30	8	7	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2QRIAGC06TE7J	"H. J. Matthews ""Soccer Dad"""	"The decision on this movie is simple.  If you are a fan of the Firefly TV series, you must see this movie.  It brings to conclusion several (but not all) of the long-term sub-plots introduced in the series.  If you are not a fan, this movie is just so-so because you won't understand why certain events and interactions are significant without knowing the character development of past episodes.If you have never seen the Firefly series, consider getting into it.  It's that good.  For just under $20 I bought the entire series as a collector set from Amazon in late June, 2008.  On four DVDs it's the entire single season that aired and was tragically cancelled before anyone knew it had begun.  The Firefly series and its conclusion movie Serenity are a wonderful combination of the action-packed sci-fi/space and western genres - all presented with witty conversations, wonderful characters, and hilarious situations that have viewers literally laughing out loud again and again.To better understand this recommendation, pick a favorite TV series with funny characters.  For illustration, I'll pick Everybody Loves Raymond.  Now imagine the charcters buy the space ship equivalent of a yacht and travel together to remote planets so early in their settlement they resemble western frontier territories.  Even if the plot, special effects, and action made a first-rate movie, it's the funny characters playing it out that would make this hypothetical movie tremendously entertaining.  Using my example: when Marie and Debra Barrone argue about cooking in the ship's galley, and then Raymond gets a larger slice of pie than Robert, it's a lot funnier if you already know those characters from the TV series.The Serenity movie is similar to the example above.  It's OK in its own right, but tons better if you know the characters from the Firefly series.  It's a little worse in the case of Serentiy because the setting requires some Firefly background to make sense.  A Star Trek movie wouldn't make complete sense if you hadn't watched the series enough to understand that Klingons are always war-like, Romulans routinely use cloaking devices, and the Federation is guided by the Prime Directive.  Firefly similarly creates a universe setting with its own ""rules"", and the Serenity movie just can't take the time to explain it all again.In conclusion:1.  If you've watched Firefly, buy the Serenity movie.2.  If you haven't watched Firefly, buy the Firefly series and then watch the Serenity movie.  You'll be glad you did, on both counts.3.  If you haven't watched Firefly and won't follow #2 above, then don't buy the Serenity movie."	5.0	Firefly fans only	2008-08-17	2	2	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2QSVJFJFSRPCV	"H. Lajos ""nihilius79"""	"Serenity was one of the most enjoyable science fiction movie aired recently. However the storyline in not too complex, nevertheless better than the storylines of the new star wars trilogy or star trek nemesis. After seeing Serenity and the Firefly series I realized why these became cultic. Know I try to specify a few values of Serenity. The camera navigation is very fine grained and fortunately not ""shaky"". The illumination effects of the scenes are very aesthetic, too.  I very liked the smooth presentations of the futuristic cities. The space battles are thrilling and artistic; I think those screens are breathtakingly realistic. So the CGI is excellent, of course this is a subjective opinion. The cast was excellent, but the storyline sometimes seems to be too dramatic. I personally very liked River's character. Summer Glau played very professionally the uncontrollable River who is struggling with her ""mental problems"". She plays River as natural as Sigourney Weaver played Ripley in Alien. The fighting sequences were awesome with the subtle choreography. This movie is worth watching not just for the Firefly fans, but for anyone who like science fiction. The director Joss Whedon has a special skill to synthesize different movie styles which is perfectly discernible in the ""firefly universe"". In the collector's edition DVD you can find plenty of extra footage and interviews, especially interesting the new construction of the serenity spaceship and Whedon's comments about the struggle for Serenity. Altogether Serenity was one of the best science fiction experiences for me recently. I evaluated this movie as a breakthrough among shallow science fiction films.

It did more with a miniscule budget, than so many special effects driven movies could begin to do.  After all, does it really matter how pretty a movie is, when you don't care about the characters or what happens to them?Lately the emphasis in SciFi movies has been style over substance.  ""Serenity"" actually has substance.  I do think some of the more subtle things from the movie will be missed by anyone who isn't familiar with the TV series that it is based upon, ""Firefly.""  So I would recommend becoming familiar with the series first to get the most out of the movie.  The movie is a little darker than the series, but I consider both to be worth owning, and I do indeed have the DVD set from the series as well as ""Serenity"" the movie.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it was a little too dark for my tastes, but that is just my preference and has nothing to do with the actual quality of the movie.It may not be to everyone's tastes, but if you value substance over style, character driven movies vs. action driven movies, and witty dialogue; then this is the movie for you!  Don't get me wrong, it has plenty of action, but it is more character driven.  It is not constant action-packed action.  On the other hand, if you think Jar Jar Binks is the best character to come along in ages, you may want to skip this one."	4.0	Definitely worth seeing	2006-02-06	7	7	0

Serenity the movie provides something of a winding up, a resolution, to one of the underlying themes of the series, but still leaves fans wanting, in more ways than one.  It is also one of the few series that translated well to the big screen.In describing the movie, it's difficult not to give away more than one should.  The Alliance is once more after the crew of Serenity, wanting to get its collective hands on River.  A different agent is sent, and he is dangerous, because he believes with all of his being that what he is doing is right.  But some who came before him believed the same thing.  They were very wrong.If this is to be the last of Serenity on the screen, I only wish that other threads had been tied up more securely, but who knows.  Maybe there'll be another movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2OFNB70I7BWIC	Iona Selidor	Don't make the mistake of thinking Serenity is as good as Firefly, because it isn't.  It's as good as it can be, I guess, after what the Fox network executives put the cast and crew of Firefly through. But the sad truth is that once a show is canceled, even if it gets resurrected at a later date, things can never be quite the same. Even if the same crew returns, the same writers, the same cast - something will always be missing. Something intangible. The sometimes magical interaction among those involved gets tarnished, somehow. Maybe it's the sense of betrayal that causes the dynamic to shift, ever so slightly. A show like Firefly comes along just once, if that, in an actor's lifetime.  If Firefly transcended itself to art, then Serenity is it's perfect foil. And it drives home what the Fox network stole away from each and every one of us. At any rate, you should buy this movie and enjoy it, if only to support Universal for giving the Firefly people a much deserved second chance. Or not. After all, what do I know?	5.0	But You Can Never Go Back.	2010-03-15	4	2	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ABXUZ1DIJWPYO	Ita Moon	"PLUMB CRAZY: What's happened to me? My entire life, I've never ever been this enamored of a film. It's like catchin' a serious case of the Beatlemania. There's way too long a wait for entertainment worthy of some serious fanaticism. Never fear: `Serenity' has arrived.HOT AS A WHOREHOUSE ON NICKEL NIGHT: Terrific dialogue rendered in a wickedly engaging lexical mixture of American West / Mandarin / semi-antiquated English. Hi-larious repartee. Strongly delineated characters that (gulp!) actually drive the plot rather than the innocuously interchangeable folk we see in today's tv/film. Unique future worlds where the only aliens are the people who inhabit them. A frontier-style existence butting heads with the 26th century. And that's just the beginning. `Serenity' is a rodeo ride of adrenal action, bucking emotional intensity, jolting plot-twists (ok, enough metaphor.) Oh! I can't forget the stirring score by David Newman. Haunting musical motives for the ship as well as for its captain, passengers and enigmatic foe.  Did I mention absolutely perfect casting? Can't imagine anyone else in these roles. (And yes, I've ordered multiple copies of Serenity - a most excellent Christmas gift for the deserving.)POWERFUL GOOD: Once upon a time, my housemate forced me to view a single downloaded episode of this movie's tv series precursor: `Firefly.' Bang! I was hooked. This little bit of illegality paid off in spades for the network beancounters; I went on to purchase 4 dvd sets of the tv series. (One is going to my local library. Share the wealth!)Having said how enthralled I became with the show, I'm way too close to these great characters and their world to ever step back and judge impartially. So I can't really attest to the `standalone-ness' of `Serenity' for newbies.However - some anecdotal evidence says it's a great introduction to this wonderful world of writer/director Joss Whedon: I took an uninitiated friend to the Boston `Serenity' opening. By her demand, I loaned the Firefly discs one by one. Within 5 days, she was phoning me, ""Ok! I'm ready for the next disc!"" ""Uh... sorry, those 14 episodes- that's all there is."" ""WHAT? YOU'RE KIDDING! WHAT AM I GONNA DO?"" (See Serenity again, naturally!) Now, with her own Firefly dvd set permanently occupying the player, she's begun filming a documentary focusing on Firefly/Serenity's New England fans.FINE AS CREAM GRAVY: One last thing - for me, frustratingly irresolute Anti-heroes and downright congenial Villains never fail to create that delectably mysterious `grey' area so reflective of our actual lives.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1JEEHM4ACXJZA	"Jack Bratincevic ""Aspiring Conductor"""	"""Science Fiction"" in this case meaning guys in spaceships.This film is probably the best I have seen since Lord of the Rings, and I've a feeling that it will be the best I see for many years.  The dialogue between characters is sometimes unsophisticated, but always amusing.  The action is excellent.  The villains are frightening and the heroes are the most entertaining set of rogues since The Matrix.  The underlying theme of freedom is one I identify with very strongly, and despite the film's setting of outer space, the crew of the good ship Serenity is a distinctly-American group of lone warriors.  This is an oft-explored concept to be sure, but Serenity does it with a perfectly conceived balance of poise and guts.I'm a Trekkie, but this kicks the hell out of Star Trek.  It damn near unseats the Star Wars films too, and on some days, I am convinced  it is better than them.  Simply put, this film has given me hope for the soul of American entertainment.This is the second review I have ever written, the first being a review of ths original TV show, Firefly.  I strongly urge you to buy this DVD--it is absolutely worth the purchase.  I am purchasing this film not because I wish to own it (I can burn a copy if I care to), but to contribute in my meager way to the making of another film, and hopefully, more TV shows."	5.0	Perhaps the best science fiction film ever.	2006-01-02	9	7	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1RBPJO4C0U32C	Jack Flack	One of the best science fiction movies ever made. Even if you didn't see the TV series the movie holds together very well, the characters are memorable, and the story line is intriguing. You do not need to have watched Firefly to enjoy this.A couple of recent reviews were so mired in dishonesty and stupidity that some comment is indicated.No, this movie owes no debt to Star Wars. Star Wars is a series for children, preteens and young teens. Serenity is for adults. Anyone who thinks this movie has any meaningful comparison to Star Wars has lost contact with reality. When you graduate from high school, try watching Serenity again, because you clearly do not get it. And by the way, when Star Wars makes you cringe and turn it off, you will know you are an adult.And yes this is science fiction. It takes place in the future, on undiscovered worlds and it takes place in space, any of which qualify it as science fiction. This however is intelligent science fiction with great character development so those who have been mired in the putrid swamp where a great deal of science fiction rests, may not recognize good science fiction.And no, this is not a bad Star Trek episode. Star Trek was ground breaking in its day, but only the very best Trek episodes could be honestly mentioned in the same breath with the Firefly episodes, and nothing in the Trek series approaches this movie.People who are trying to compare this to Star Wars or Star Trek don't get it at all. That's like trying to compare watermelons and oranges.	5.0	Amazing movie	2006-09-16	6	4	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1JY4FALTYNZFG	Jack McPherson	"Since the time of Star Wars, or maybe even before, we have seen and enjoyed the western set in outer space or through science fiction. And we've seen the darker side of the myth of the clich&eacute; riddled western hero bring home the best picture Oscar for Unforgiven.  Serenity is a nice addition to this new style of western hero.Nathan Fillion as the captain of an interplanetary space ship brings as much life to his role of Captain Malcolm Reynolds as Harrison Ford brings to Indiana Jones or Hans Solo.  He's on the lamb from an oppressive ""big brother"" type galactic government. Reynolds sneaks just under the radar doing some odd jobs just south of legal to keep his ship and crew intact. His struggling business is barely operational and all he cares about is his freedom, his crew, and not much else.Through his amazement he discovers one of his crew happens to be public enemy number one to the galactic police and now the choice of sacrificing his crew and/or his freedom has to be made.  Something got to give, and not everyone is happy with the choice.I saw the film before I saw the series, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I immediately rented the series, and then watched the movie again...and LOVED the filmThe series is uneven, but generally good.  But the character development that's added in the series makes the movie great.I simply can't recommend it enough, and I hope to see Nathan Fillion in many more movies to come."	5.0	Not your clich&eacute; riddled Western.	2007-01-05	4	4	0

I just recently discovered and watched the Firefly series and was thrilled to finally go to this movie.  I do not go  to the movies often, letting them wait to come to DVD, but this one I was determined to see, and would do so again.  I am a bit partial to Captain Mal though (he is a joy to watch), so my review does get biased toward that fact.  Mal does get a bit more serious in this movie, as there isn't quite as much of the lightheartedness that there was in Firefly.  He and Inara can still manage to bicker though, even while under duress.  I loved Star Trek, enjoyed Star Wars, but this series surpasses both of them for me.  And Mal is no Han Solo cliche, pleeease.  The lives of the characters are just so much more realistic, and yes, there is plenty of action to go along with the story.  I wish the best for Joss, he is a creative genius, and I really hope that this isn't the final screen time for the Serenity crew.	5.0	A multifaceted jewel to me	2005-10-22	0	0	0

Having never seen the television series Firefly, I thought the movie was good, not great, and dismissed it as an average sci fi movie.  With that being said I have since watched the series Firefly and then watched the movies once more.  Firefly takes place prior to Serenity, and sets up the entire premise for the movie.  More over, the movie gives you closure to the very inconclusive season of Firefly.  In my opinion, Firerly was meant to be at least a 3 season series, but was unfortunately cancelled after only one.

The first two episodes were incredibly well done.The movie picks up, sorta, from where the series left off. Watching with my wife, who hadn't see the series, she was a bit lost, while I was a bit bored.Some of the dialect was somewhat out of place, as they didn't seem to go fully into the tounge like they did in the series. There were random moments of alien and western dialect that seemed out of place when there was so little of it.The actors seemed to be playing the same characters as the series, but were older, and perhaps better actors - which made the acting seem ...odd.If you liked the series, the movie is worth a watch.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AZBME7LBPMF7W	"Jakob Ambrose ""Jake"""	What made Firefly a chore to sit through was the fact that it did not have a focus. It felt like it was meandering for far too long first episode before it made an effort to tell a season narrative. I mean the actual first episode and not the train robbery. The episodes were disjointed and written by someone that did not have an clue what he wanted to do with the series. Had Whedon figured out a direction before the first episode was penned and stayed with it, then it might have done better with the science fiction audience. Instead, he produced D work and it only has appeal to his fans and no one else.Serenity, on the other hand is everything that Firefly should have been. Yes, I like the movie and hate the series it was based on, something a lot more common that you think. The movie did more things right than the series. It had a clear focus that went somewhere. We understood the goal of the story and it did not waver from it. Every line of dialog added to the story and was not a wasted, look at how clever I am, bit of witty banter that makes non Whedonites want to strangle themselves. Even the story made a sort of sense that worked within the universe and did not reference anything else.The best part of the script is that it trusted itself enough to not waste time explaining how things work in the universe. It told the audience just enough to understand and follow it. All I needed to know about, namely the main characters, their allies, the bad guys and what happened before the series was summed up nicely in the first act. It did not waste time with being clever and told a compelling story. While it did not compel me to seek out the series afterwards, I did not feel like my intelligence was insulted by this movie.Unfortunately, when I did seek out Firefly, it felt more like a waste of time than anything insightful. The series was not nearly a tenth as good as the movie. The series fell into the same trap that all of Whedon's creations fall into. It did not trust the audience to get what it was trying to do. Instead, it meanders around in the dark wasting eight or nine valuable episodes building a universe instead of creating a compelling storyline with character development and a destination. The science fiction audience is a lot smarter than Whedon gave us credit for and would have accepted a lot with the just go with it explanation. We did not need witty asides, clever banter, or incoherent plot threads. He just needed to trust us to get it and not hold our hand through the series.What's even more infuriating is that Whedon's squandered a chance to make Firefly good by doing what he did with Buffy and Angel. He wasted too many episodes with world building and not providing a good story. In the same amount of episodes that Whedon typically wastes, other producers and writers could come up with 3 dimensional characters, believable universes, and great story lines and build to a logical conclusion. That's the difference between good writers and Whedon. Whedon takes 13 episodes to lay down the foundations of the universe, something that he should have done before filming the first episode.	4.0	Everything Firefly should have been	2012-03-10	3	0	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2OCB6QT2BPB99	"James A. Cambron ""Ack, who else?"""	"Exactly what makes Serenity a good movie?It's cinematic structure does not rely on ""little green men"" or ""bug-eyed monsters"" to tell a story of human struggle.  It assumes that mankind does not make quantum leaps in technology and thus the story line does not hang on a wildly futuristic,  scientific/philosophical ""Deus Ex Machina"" to pull the good guys' fat out of the fire. It works on the premise that, in the distant future, people are people and governments are governments just as they are today.And that may also be the reason why ""Serenity"" is considered to be a terrible movie.  Those that hate it seem to hate it exactly because of how different it is from the rest of the genre in the above mentioned respects.  I had an aquaintence start spouting off about ""no Faster Than Light travel"",  ""no aliens"" and ""a pod race ripoff"" when ""discussing"" the movie.  Funny, I don't remember the Mule/Reaver skiff chase scene being 1/8th as loud as the pod race in Star Wars Episode 1 -- which I heard on line outside the theatre  through a building wall. Inside the theatre, my ears nearly bled during that scene.Consider this:  Many reviewers make mention of how Mal Reynolds is a Han Solo character like this is a bad thing.  I believe that the strength of the first three Star Wars movies is in the characters -- as is the case of Serenity (and the Firefly series for that matter).  An action-adventure movie without a believeable, three-dimensional leading  character isn't much of an action-adventure movie. So there are obvious similarities between Mal and Han.  And your point is?Finally this about the movie's box-office success:  There have been a number of big budget movies made recently that did a whole lot worse than Serenity did at the boxoffice. The classic comparison example is Stealth (with a production budget of something over $300 million) which has made back a very small fraction of its budget in boxoffice and DVD earnings.  Serenity, on the other hand, is less than half a million dollars away from breaking even on it's $38 million production budget as the DVD is released.  Hmmmm.....On to the DVD.Like most DVDs, Serenity has the usual outtakes, cut scenes, ""the making of"" and commentary.  These items are what further drive the sales of a DVD. Serenity does deliver on this.  While the outtake language gets a bit salty at times, it is also gut-bustingly funny and irreverent! The ""making of"" material is very interesting and provides some insights into how one can make  a good movie on a small budget.  At times Joss's commentary gets a bit preachy, but just when he does get preachy, he pokes fun at himself.  Most of the time he describes how craft of movie-making is done through detailed planning and how sometimes it's just plain dumb, quirky luck.Finally, watch out for the Easter Egg! It's Fruity AND Oatey!Thank you for your time..."	5.0	a good movie -- in a whacky genre	2005-12-23	12	11	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A4EPLQ2ZSZ5HA	James D. Cox	Self-acknowledged fan-boy.  Can't help it just like that Firefly series.  Never could figure out why it didn't make it - that is until I saw this film.  This movie reminded me of a medicore pilot, not the triumphal return of the series.  Was not too suprised that it did poorly at the box-office.  If this was the 1st thing, we wouldn't have had the Firefly series.  So all that being said, I liked it since it was a chance to see old friends (maybe one last time).  I did like the way it both left the future open and tied together a bunch of Firefly threads.  So my one question (aside from real-life aging) is why do the actors look so different when it is supposed to be just a few months later from the last Firefly episode?  If you like/love Firefly you will enjoy this film, otherwise it is just another soap opera sequel.	3.0	Fanboy dissappointed	2005-12-12	51	5	46
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2BFIYZYNK54QX	"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale"""	I'm not going to go deep into plot points or how great the story is, how truly involving and exciting the action sequences are, how sublime the performances are, how masterful the dialogue is. You know why? Because I hate Joss Whedon. He has done more to make me cry man-tears than any other genre creator has ever done. He has been responsible for more great episodes of TV than just about any other genre creator I know of. This film is just another example of how much I hate him. I don't hate him because he's good. I hate him because he's GREAT!!!! I want just a little of his talent... maybe I'll ask Santa...Anyway, as another reviewer here stated, it is HIGHLY recommended that you see the show first not so much because of the plot, but for the characters to grow on you. Buy the DVD set of the series, then go out and get the film. You can't stop the signal.	5.0	Shiny!	2005-12-21	9	8	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3F3B6HY9RJI04	James Duckett	Before catching Serenity I did want to watch Firefly, the entire first (and only) season, to get a more familiarity to the show.  That being said, you can watch this movie and still get a kick out of it without watching the television show, but I would recommend watching the first season if you've got a lot of time on your hands.  It was a five-star show that got cancelled well before its prime.  There was a central plot to the show and that plot is finally resolved in this movie.The movie is fantastic!  And it did quite well (better than anybody expected) at the box office which goes to show that the series should have had a few more years in it.  This is Sci-Fi at its finest, even though it does have quite a Western/Frontier feel to it.  It was nice to see Firefly upgraded with a more decent budget for the special effects.  And they didn't go too overboard with the special effects so that it distracted from the story.The characters were right on.  Nobody was out of character at all from the series.  But you can tell that this was written to finalize the series as some of the crew do end up dieing.  It probably made this movie better, not trying to work a storyline for a sequel into it, but it is heartbreaking to watch a few people we care about die.This movie is very highly recommended whether you've seen the series or not.  If you haven't seen the series and enjoyed the movie, you need to check it out even though the plot will be blown for you at that point.  I would highly recommend catching the series first.	5.0	A Great Wrapup To a Great Show	2006-04-15	6	6	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1BDEIU06IFUC1	"James M. Nelson ""blacksmithn"""	I am hard pressed to think of a sci-fi film which is better than Serenity. The dialogue is smart and snappy. The plot is involving, the characters endearing.On it's face, the summarized plot sounds rather shopworn-- a ragtag, motley crew of reluctant outlaws sets out to save the galaxy from an evil empire. Sound familiar? But similarity with other, better known (or perhaps just more expensively produced) films of the genre ends there.I don't recall any vital systems literally falling off the Millenium Falcon in mid-flight. Neither do I recall any of the various Enterprise commanders robbing a backwater bank of a payroll just to keep going one more day. Character, dialog and storyline play a more important role than CGI special effects or whiz-bang techno gadgets. Perhaps that's why this film has aged so well where others have not.Note that familiarity with the TV series, Firefly, is not necessary to enjoy this film, although it does give background and added depth to some of the characters-- Shepherd Book and Inara, in particular.	5.0	She's tore up plenty, but she'll fly true...	2010-04-29	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A25N4T1FRM8Y5B	"James Walker ""Zod"""	This movie is arguably Joss Whedon's best work. I loved the movie and also loved the series Firefly (sadly cut down in its prime bu unimaginative network marketing morons, which I had to order on DVD because we don't get to see much that's good here in Australia). The western and space elements are well blended and are only silly when they're meant to be - quite an achievement. The characters are great and the drama and humour are mixed with a skill that Hollywood usually cannot manage. In places it's like Mad Max (Road Warrior to Americans) in space, when the Reavers turn up to terrorize everyone. Joss gives us tough guys and mercenaries and rebel geniuses and space battles and air battles and brawls and assassins and hackers and love and tragedy and humour and rebellion lost causes and lots more. If you don't see this movie you're missing out.	5.0	A refreshing change to ordinary hollywood scifi products	2006-03-21	6	5	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2OLKV9F2S7O6N	James W. Picht	"I'm a fan of science fiction films, but I'd be the first to admit that the genre is deservedly under-represented on most ""best films of the decade"" lists. Does Serenity belong on those lists? Not if you think great film is always high art. But Serenity does what too few Great Films get around to doing - it tells an exciting and interesting story, it builds suspense, it makes you care about the characters, it leaves you drained and satisfied at the end. If Serenity isn't Great Art, it is superlative entertainment.The dialogue isn't great art. It is, however, witty, brisk, and effective. The acting isn't brilliant, but the actors enjoy what they're doing and imbue their characters with believable humanity in over-the-top unbelievable situations. The special effects are good, but they don't overshaddow the actors and they aren't the point of the film. The story is the point, and the story is a very, very good one. And it's told very, very well.The movie begins with a computer simulation/recreation of a brother's attempt to save his sister from some seriously bad government bad guys. We understand almost immediately that these two siblings are devoted to each other. When the computer recreation ends we meet the film's chief bad guy. Within minutes we realize that this is one of those really scary villains, the kind who knows that what he does is bad but believes he's doing it for the very best cause. He's not a casual killer, but he can easily kill anyone, any number of anyones, for the sake of his cause. That sense of ultimate virtue drives him until the final minutes of the film.The film is space opera. A brave but damaged spaceship captain and his daring but badly flawed crew have taken in the siblings and flee with them across the galaxy as they try to stay out of harm's way. Death and ruin follow wherever they go. Will they prevail in the end and strike a blow against the interstellar government? Of course they will. We know that from the beginning. It's a testament to the creative skill of the director and writer that we know that and are kept at the edges of our seats anyway. This is space opera as it should be, sci fi at its very best. It's a morality play with none of the philosophical, moral, or artistic pretentiousness that afflict most sci fi that tries to be Art. It's a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. And it's a fitting continuation of the grossly underrated TV series that spawned it, Firefly.This collector's edition has some entertaining features that weren't included in the original DVD release of the film. I enjoyed watching it at a friend's house, but I won't replace my own copy until I upgrade my DVD player. It isn't worth it to me to spend $17 for the extra features. Given the choice between the collector's edition and the regular edition, though, the price differential would make this edition worth buying to me.  If you don't own this movie and you like DVD extras, this is the edition to buy. If you don't own this movie and you like sci fi, what are you waiting for? Buy this movie, any edition. If you don't like sci fi but you like a good story, take a gamble - there's a good chance you'll like this movie. A good story transcends genre, and this is a good story."	5.0	Science fiction at its best	2007-08-23	4	4	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1QPAKHZKBY7YY	Jane	After over 1,200 five star reviews I am pressed to say something unique about Joss Whedon's 'Serenity'. Fantastic movie that followed a wonderful sci-fi western called 'Firefly'. The crime is that 'Firefly' was discontinued after eleven episodes, not unlike the 'Babylon 5' off-shoot, 'Crusade'(another show that did not get the run it deserved).As others have said, 'Serenity' transcends genre and is an emotional, visual and operatic treat. A rare and unique gem in sci-fi movie adventure. It's a complete picture and does not require that you've seen the show, although there are plenty of treats for 'Firefly' fans. Collector's edition has a nice enclosure, some great extras and scenes, including some interviews.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2BTP4Y20M9G5G	Jane W. Elioseff	"Virtually everything I loved about the ""Firefly"" series is missing from the movie. The storyline of ""Serenity"" is only tangent to the ""Firefly"" narrative; the movie actually loses ground gained in ""Firefly"" when it comes to mutual trust, affection, and respect. ""Serenity"" also lacks the easy western pace and humor of ""Firefly"", to say nothing of the good lighting and always audible dialogue of the TV series. In short, ""Serenity"" most nearly resembles a video game. Much shooting and hacking and stabbing. Two of my favorites from among the original ""Firefly"" crew members die (although they are all favorites -- part of the strength of the series) and even the spaceship Firefly is finally smashed to pieces. I've watched the DVD of the TV series four or five times now and gave it to half my friends for Christmas in 2005.

The special effects budget for the movie allowed for some gorgeous exterior shots of Serenity. You can see the ship's flaws better, even see the rainwater flowing off the ship at the end. I'm new to BluRay, but felt it was worth the money to see it in more theatre detail. It did that!As for the movie itself, I think people who haven't seen the TV show can easily follow the movie. There's an amazing shot in the beginning that steadycams through the guts of the ship and introduces you to almost the entire crew and the layout of the ship. You get introduced fast.

To the characters and great storyline I would have to say  amazing. The storyline is about a crew who are bandits in space, stealing what they can to stay alive and healthy , things started to get hairy when they pick up a young girl( River Tam) who is the doctors sister on board.  Captain Malcom Reynolds finds himself running from a skilled Alliance operative who wants River Tam, and who will stop at nothing to get her; meanwhile, River's capabilities become more clear to the crew of Serenity.If you like Sci-fiction movies this is your cup of tea or if you don't, give it a watch I think you could find it to be surprisingly good.The future is worth fighting for.	4.0	Surprisingly Brilliantly, the underdog strikes high	2006-03-12	3	3	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1B06TR6SQRFB6	"Jason Shawn ""fistagon7"""	"From Smother Magazine - smother.net:I wasn't holding my breath for this movie but my good friend at work kept insisting on its state of awesomeness so I figured I'd give it a whirl once it the DVD circuit. I watched the first half an hour and thought to myself what a bad straight from UPN (or WB, whatever network ""Firefly"" was on) but thankfully it got a lot better once the action really started. As far as Sci-Fi goes, there usually aren't a lot of good movies out there; sure every now and again you'll get your ""Matrix"" or ""Alien"" or even ""Predator"" but typically they're low budget affairs that have horrible acting and even worse cinematography. While the dialogue throughout ""Serenity"" was cheesy and comedic (Captain Malcolm Reynolds reminded me of the captain prince hero from Mel Brooks' ""Space Balls""), the action was great and the storyline was compelling. And a virgin viewer of this movie whom had never seen nor heard of ""Firefly"" can still follow the plot without struggle. But what really stood out for me was how intriguing the cinematography was; the galaxy was etched well as were all of the sets on the ground. You won't find any big name movie stars here, unless you count Adam Baldwin (based on his last name and not his acting skills of course), but I will tell you that Yan and Rafael Feldman are NOT related to Corey!

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2PIX2K56IZZYX	Jason W. Kaiser	I had no idea what to expect with this, good sci-fi movie's are so hard to find these days, plus I had never seen any of the short-lived TV series 'Firefly' which this was based on. Well, I'm happy to report that not only do you not need to have seen the series to follow this, but you're going to have a real good time watching this. It is really done well, strong action and acting with some perfectly timed comedic touches. It is two hours long, but I was actually wishing it had been a little longer as I was that into it. I'm probably going to get torched for this, but I'd pick this over the last Star Wars just slightly, which was the last decent sci-fi I'd seen before Serenity.Keep this name in mind, Summer Glau, she plays River, the whole movie is pretty much based around her, and she is one hell of an actress, plus the girl has some incredible fight scenes that will knock your socks off. I'm sure she had some training and a stunt double, but even if that means she only performed half of the stunts, it's still pretty impressive. Nathan Fillion plays Reynolds, the captain of his ship 'Serenity' and I know once you see him you'll recognize him, he was the husband of the girl in 'Two guys, a girl, and a pizza place. He too is very solid, both charming and intense when need be. Another fine performance comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor, he plays the main bad guy from The Alliance, a group that wants the powerfull River all to themselves, but can't seem to catch up with Reynolds and his crew who River and her brother are flying with. He shows no emotion, you almost think he might be an android, but he to can kick alot of butt, and his fight scene toward the end with Captain Reynolds is quite a watch.The rest of Reynolds crew are all very good, including Adam Baldwin, who plays Jayne, and some of his back-and-forth with Reynolds is priceless. Also, the movie looks great, no grain, great sound, outstanding sets and locations, and the battle scenes between the spaceships does rival some of the best Star Wars endings. It is surprisingly violent for a PG-13, and also has lots of salty languange, I'd say 14 years old and above should be fine. I'm not going to go into much of the plot, mostly because it's rather complicated and I don't want to ruin anything for anyone who wants to rent Firefly first before watching this. My only complaint is the man who plays River's brother is a real wuss, and I didn't care for his character at all, it may or may not be the actor's fault, but it sucked. He whines alot and gets his assed kicked severall times by both the good guys and the bad........wuss.I'm not sure why Hollywood doesn't seem to into sci-fi's anymore, but it was real refreshing to not only see one, but a good one at that. Although they tied most of the loose ends up, I have heard rumors that a sequel is being discussed, mostly because it was such a surprise at the box-office. But if you think about, why was it such a surprise? there are so many sci-fi fans out there, and so few movies, you are almost guaranteed success if you even make a crappy one. Well, I rented Red Eye with this, so I'll be back soon with some thoughts on Wes Craven'a latest suspense ride, until then, take care all......	4.0	Great Sci-Fi Fun Here....................	2006-01-29	5	4	1

Seemed like a great series, yet neither Amazon nor NetFlix had season two ... it took me a while to figure out there had never been a season 2, and then another fan told me you had to watch the Serenity movie to see what happened.While I was sad there were no more seasons of Firefly, I thought Serenity did a great job of explaining who the characters were, what had already happened to them, and why. The ending was very good, except for one character's death that I still don't know why they chose to do it that way!

Because of this movie I found Firefly. Yeah, I know it's a little backwards, but it worked for me. If we can't have any more Firefly at least they gave us a movie. If you liked Firefly, you'll like this movie. Of course, in two hours they can't cover everything, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to accept.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AJ3B28G4RCTPS	J.C.Devon	I love Science fiction,but for the most part only in book form...and only if it has a good sense of humor.I believe i can count on one hand the Sci-Fi movies I like let alone love.. btw Star Wars is only marginally on the like list.I am not a Joss Whedon fan in particular I can easily recognize his considerable talent in Buffy and Angel,but these failed to engage me enough to consider myself a fan.Then came Firefly ,I loved it and looked forward to Friday nights while it was on TV..It was special ..it was far better than anything I had ever seen on TV before or since...and then came the series on DVD and I found out I was far from the only person who loved this show.Serenity didn't disappoint, it is a great film.It is succeeds completely in every way it attempts to work.The rules are turned upside down from the convention we are programed to expect in our Sci Fi... A spaceship without weapons or faster than light travel..worlds without alien lifeforms, dialog without continuous cussing that still manages to be adult and smart the way very few films are, good guys who do bad things and bad guys who do good things often depending on the perspective of the characters surrounding them our hero's believe things , to the point of being willing to die for them that most others in their world believe the exact opposite or just don't bother to care much about at all. Great FX and CGI but only to support terrific performances and dialog not to make the viewer say wow.. the viewers do often say wow but because of the script and real ideas not because of eye candy CGI...and a space battle focusing not on reaping mass destruction and racking up casualties but primarily avoiding being destroyed themselves whilst fighting toward the goal of simply getting out the truth so people may draw their own conclusions but from an honest and educated bearing.This is great story telling.This is great film making.This is a great film,and its also great fun to watch by the way...You should buy it,and while your at it you should go ahead and buy the Firefly series at the same time..You will want it after seeing Serenity and both are very re-watchable, Hell Ive had Firefly since the day it became available on DVD and I still am prone to pop a disk in and watch and enjoy it...even still notice new things in the episodes with almost every viewing.	5.0	This is what filmmaking is suposed to be.	2005-12-26	10	10	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A6MBJNDVCWXRT	J. C. Little	I feel left out. I never saw the origonal series as broadcast on TV, I didn't even know it existed until it was too late. I saw this movie at the store when it first came out and thought it looked like an interesting made for TV movie spin off. Boy was I wrong.Encapsulated is an amazing deconstruction of the members of the crew of the Firefly class Ship Serenity. Their quirks, their habits and their interactions with one another. You get a sense of who everyone is and where their places are on the ship. This was a great introduction for me, as I would only later discover that there was an entire series before the events of this movie. More to the point, when I watched that show I realized how the single movie paled in comparison to the narrative woven by Joss W. in the Series.I thought the movie would be an exxageration of the show, boy was I wrong. The movie is the show, drawn out and with the bells and whistles of holywood magic, but it is the show and these are the characters. If it had to end, this was a hell of a way to send it off. If you love sci-fi that breaks the mold and shows you a different kind of future that's flush with hints of our past, this is for you. It's got humor, it's got space ships, it's got government conspiracies and it's got cowboys and robbers. In one word, it's the goran.	5.0	My First Introduction to the Serenity Crew	2013-05-25	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AP8DIYOZ6YFT3	J. Curran	"Before I write this review I will admit that I had never even heard of Firefly up until Serenity came out.  Well, I had heard about it, but it disappeared before my age/maturity came about in order to truely understand it.  I never watched it... there, I said it.  Putting all that aside though;Serenity has by far been the best movie I've seen in quite some time.  That's not to say that other movies aren't as good, but this movie had everything I'd been looking for.  Futuristic Sci-Fi, gun fights, space-ships, zombie-like creatures, a ninja(what else would you call him?), and good old mature humor.The story of Serenity, as seen by someone who has not experienced Firefly yet, can be seen as a story of freedom.  Several people crew a ship, Serenity, and fly around space committing random felonies for money.  Though they are ""bank robbers"" they are not ruthless people.  They simply look-out for themselves and those closest to them.  It's shown that they do care about people in general through-out the movie, but they tend to only look out for those that fly with them.I won't get too into the storyline (I do have to get back to work =P), but I can assure you that other reviews have.  My reasons for this review are simply to let you know that the movie doesn't have to have a rapper in it to be good.  It doesn't need a truck-load of big names to be good.  It doesn't need a lot of dramatic pauses and tacked-on Hollywood messages to be good.What a move needs to be good is what Serenity has to offer.  Greats actors and actresses that work well together off screen and on screen.  One deep and constant message instead of several messages thrown together.  Zombie-like creatures.  And the desire to make you seek humanity where ever you can find it.If you're more in to Honda's with three foot spoilers and cheesey lines about racing, you probably won't like this movie... you've probably never even heard of it.  But for the ""some of us""... the ""please, God, not another car chase!""s... the ""just cause he can rap doesn't mean he can act""s... the ""if it's got that much hype, it'll probably suck""s among us, I recommend this movie.  Not only will you enjoy it, but you may damn well find yourself kicking your ass for not watching Firefly."	5.0	A bow to the Cinderella story =)	2005-12-27	12	11	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AUL07HFEL8U1J	J. Edmunds	"**spoiler alert** First, you have to GET Joss Whedon's writing style to enjoy this. If you don't get it, then you won't like it. It's very Whedon-y. Second, my review is going to be extremely slanted because I do GET and thoroughly enjoy Whedon's universe. So, assuming that you've never seen an episode of Firefly, but that you are acquainted with the Buffy Universe you'll understand that sarcasm, unexpected humor in dark situations, girl power, and smarm are all part of the charm that is Serenity. It's more blatantly a ""space western"" than even Star Wars was. It is literally young man go terraform a planet instead of young man go west. The government is a bad thing, the government wants to control how you think, feel, and behave. Some people, like Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew don't hold to that. Psychic River Tam was experimented on by the government and was rescued by her brother Simon but not before she learned a horrible secret from certain members of Parliament that they don't want the general populous to know. Now, The Operative is chasing River and the whole crew of Serenity and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Mal is a good man with his own unique code. He's a thief along the Robin Hood vein, if Robin Hood kept the loot for himself rather than giving it to the poor. But he's knows right from wrong and he believes in something greater than himself even if it takes the entire movie for him to understand that quality in himself. In short, the bad guys get it, the good guys don't come out unscathed and it's a completely satisfying end to a series that I wish had never been cancelled. But, if wishes were horses I'd be a space captain."	5.0	Love It!	2010-09-27	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AAAF2K38O63GV	"Jeff A. Krinock ""Jack Coke"""	I love the TV show Firefly. It was such a unique take on humanity's future with the combination of space travel, intermixed with the morals of the Old West.It seems to me that science fiction fans (and I am one of them) are very loyal and aware of the history of the characters and the rules of the environment (see Light Sabers in Star Wars). Sadly, Serenity changed some of the events of the TV series. Although I am not happy about the changes I am a big fan of the movie.While I hope all Firefly fans will buy the Collector's Edition to support more tales of the crew of Serenity, there is nothing truly new on the second disc.	2.0	Nice, but...	2007-09-21	14	1	13

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ	"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff"""	"I am a HUGE sci-fi fan, and my sister felt that taking me to see 'Serenity' would be a nice birthday present...unfortunately it just plain wasn't.  I have read so many reviews and heard so much from those who are familiar with the background of this movie, and almost all say you do NOT have to know anything about all that to understand and appreciate 'Serenity'.  I say BS.  As the movie began I felt like I had come in 20 minutes AFTER it had started.  It took a while for me to pick up what was going on and I really don't think I am stupid.For some to call this a modern-day Star Wars is an Injustice to that masterpiece.  Sure, many will say that 'Time will tell' regarding that statement...but I think the box-office numbers are already saying that FOR me.  I don't CARE if Ebert & Roeper gave the film two thumbs up (which they apparently did), the movie was okay at best, and without being really well versed with the back-story in the plot and where it all came from, this movie simply did not ""Do It"" for me.  I honestly wish that it had, but sorry, it just didn't.Aside from all of that, there WERE some genuinely entertaining moments throughout the film.  The special effects were by and large pretty good (which I am a real stickler about noticing).  Even though I knew virtually nobody from the movie (for the most part anyway) I felt that all the characters were well cast and the fact that I was unfamiliar with most of them did not bother me in the least.  Surprisingly funny moments came out of left field on occasion which made the experience much better than it would have otherwise.  On the whole, I guess for those who are better acquianted with the movie and how it came to be, this is probably wonderful, and I can see many really enjoying it -- however for those of us who are NOT aware of all that, be prepared to be confused from the get-go.  Don't worry, it all seems to make sense by the ending, but unfortunately the movie takes way too long to get there to make it all that worthwhile."	2.0	What am I missing?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1V5UBJ3IOOM95	"Jeffery L. Taylor ""Cooknman"""	"I remember reading a review in American Cinematographer about a movie that was coming out in the late 70's called ""Star Wars.""  As I read the review, I grew more and more excited about seeing the movie.  In contrast to the pristine space ships to date, Star Wars had things that went wrong or didn't work consistently, space junk, ships that were old and rusted, sword fights, arial dog fights, and some of the best elements from a variety of film generes. There was nothing else like it at the time, and it is now a classic that introduced technologies and techniques that changed the film industry.  It's rare that new Sci Fi movies have anything close to that winning combination: Serenity is one that does.In a day and age were most Sci Fi and action movies rely too heaviliy on special effects and CGI ""eye candy,"" Serenity has a great blend of comedy, action, and a very solid & well acted story line that make it a pleasure to watch repeatedly. Even if you didn't get to see the Firefly series for which the movie is based, it is a stand alone product that needs no prior familiarity.  Of course, because the principles were together for nearly two years, it lends to the solid performances in the movie: All of the characters are very well developed.All the same, for those of us who did see the series, the movie picks up where the series ends, and delivers upon the established characters and story, especially with the next level jump of River's character.  It's truly a shame that the series ended before the first season was even completed; It's better than half the stuff currently on TV.  If you see Serenity, you'll want to get hold of the Firefly series: It's great stuff.Serenity is one of those films that is an undiscovered jewel for many who find it.  Because of poor promotion, and a bad time slot, most people ne-ver saw the TV series. Subsequently, few saw the movie in the theatre.  Everytime I show it to friends or loan it to someone who has never seen it, they are blown away!  I've also purchased the television series of Firefly, as everyone I know who has seen the movie wants to also see the series.  If you collect DVD's this one is a definite keeper for your collection."	5.0	Solid acting, great story, and something for everyone.	2007-01-29	3	3	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A15HLDQP70YR3G	Jeff	"I just have to say, biased though it may be, that this is an amazing movie, one of the best I've ever seen.  Now most movies don't have the Cinderella story that Serenity has behind them; most movies don't come out to the screaming of applause of tens of thousands of fans of a dead TV show.  Regardless, I saw this movie before I had seen any episodes of Firefly, and I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""This is something special.""  If you see this movie before you see the series, as I did, it doesn't ruin the experience, but it definitely leaves you wanting to know more of the story behind the characters.  If you see the series first, then what are you doing reading a review!? Serenity is what you've been waiting for!"	5.0	This is a great movie	2005-12-23	11	10	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1GVWQYSQHHOWB	Jeff	The main reaction I've seen when people see this movie for the first time is confusion, at least for the first two-thirds.  If you don't get what's going on right away, keep watching and stop questioning.  Have no worries--this is an epic sci-fi blockbuster that never got the attention it deserves.If you've seen the show Firefly, you know the characters.  If you haven't, part of the fun lies in learning about what motivates them, and their individual idiosyncrasies.  Humor breaks up some of the more serious scenes, but to good effect.  The dialog is solid.  Any of the particularly cheesy dialog is handled, by way of self-referential jabs.  Also, the opposition is properly fearsome, and if you stick with the movie and listen to the dialog, very realistically motivated.The action scenes in Serenity are some of the best, and some of the most tightly choerographed that I've ever seen.  The fighting styles of the two main protagonists (Mal and River) are completely unique, and both are extremely engaging.  Further, the one major space combat scene is particularly engaging.So.. watch this movie just past Miranda.  Then review it!	5.0	Couldn't believe it was that good.	2006-01-16	4	4	0

I decided what did I have to lose. I watched most of the episodes of ""Firefly"" in one day. I don't know how much of the series I missed, but I enjoyed the witty mix of genres of Western and Sci Fi adventure. Therefore, I really wanted to see this movie and it did not disappoint me. This movie is one of the best movies developed from a TV series I have ever seen. The movie can be enjoyed without seeing the series, but the film does a great job of explaining the background of the series and tying up plot lines.The dialog is witty. The plot is not overly original, but in this day of rehashed plots from comic books and older movies, it is more original than most. I wish I saw this on the big screen, but it plays fine on DVD. The relationships of the crew members is funny and touching. Some of the captain's conversations about leadership and what it takes to be a ship captain waxes poetic, but in a very good way. The movie is not perfect, but it is the most entertaining Sci Fi movie to come out in several years."	4.0	One of the best movies developed from a TV series.	2006-01-04	15	15	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2BC978GQQEA2A	Jeffrey Pidgeon	"Not too long ago, Joss Whedon - the creator of the popular television show, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" - had another show on the air called ""Firefly"". It was a western by way of science fiction, and (due to an erratic broadcast order, some would say) it was cancelled before all of its first season episodes were aired. Like many other shows, it developed a devoted following, the series as it stood was released on DVD, and that, you might say, was that.Universal Pictures has decided to gamble on ""Serenity"", a feature film version of the show directed by its creator. Mr. Whedon insisted on retaining all of the cast members, and from what I've heard from fans, the film fits well in the program's narrative continuity. Happily, though, it's not a film that preaches exclusively to the converted.The plot focuses on River (Summer Glau), a 18-year-old being conditioned by the Alliance, a passive-agressive version of the Empire in ""Star Wars"". Much like her doppleganger Buffy, she has extrodinary fighting abilites, but it's her psychic powers that interest The Alliance the most -- River may contain information that would be incriminating to them. Her brother Simon Tam (Sean Maher) rescues her from their brainwashing, and as the film begins, they're passengers aboard the good ship Serenity.The crew - Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillin), his right hand woman Zoe (Gina Torres), her pilot husband Wash (Alan Tudyk), the Willow-like mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite), and hotheaded lunk Jayne (Adam Baldwin) - make their living by pulling small heists here and there, Butch-and-Sundance-style, on the less developed planets. In addition to the usual hazards of larceny, these areas are also rife with the Reivers, savage cannibals who rape and devour their victims alive.Like Han Solo, Malcolm is not too concerned with the political repercussions of his choice of passengers. He mainly sees River as a sort of living Fuzzbuster, potentially able to warn them of danger. However, his crew is starting to chafe with the closeness of space travel. The ship needs repairs, everyone is broke, and Kaylee is bluntly in need of shore leave. The mood of the Serenity is anything but.Unfortunately, the procedures that River has been subjected to have left her unstable, and she begins to have unpredictable, violent episodes. This, coupled with the pursuit of The Operative, an assassin sent by The Alliance to recover her and destroy her comrades, keeps the Serenity in a escalating squeeze play through the rest of the film.""Serenity"" doesn't quite free itself from its television origins as successfully as, say, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" or ""The Fugitive"". There's a lot of characters and plot to set up, and the first half hour is weighted with talky exposition. While the dialogue is snappy, the abundance of one-liners leaves the characters sounding anachronistic (most of the folksy flourishes sound awkward), and very similar to one another. Perhaps due to their premature cancellation, the performers haven't yet developed the vivid personality contrasts that can make an ensemble so much fun. There's an estranged love interest for the captain (Inara, played by Morena Baccarin), but she has little to do aside from joining the cast for a sequel.Things pick up in the second half, though, once the set-up is out of the way and we can get to the space battles and hand-to hand combat. The action sequences are a bit choppy, but they are brisk and have a nice sense of scale to them without being overwheming. It's good B-movie pulp, with nice pacing and a welcome willingness to put its characters at risk. When it counts the most, the film draws you in and makes you care.Overall, I enjoyed my stay in ""Serenity's"" universe. Whether future movies or a ""Family Guy""-style television resurrection is at hand remains to be seen."	2.0	Small Screen, Big Screen	2006-04-13	60	23	37

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZWYRK9LRMTBJ	"Jeff S. Martin ""Jeffrey Stuart Martin"""	"It would be superficial to say that Serenity is a science fiction movie. Serenity is a movie that uses genres as a foundation upon which to build a story about real people, who just happen to be vagabonds on a rusty old spaceship.The plot: Malcolm, captain of the space-ship Serenity and his crew are doing their usual gallivanting around in space, trying to eke out a living in a politically hostile environment, with one difference: their crew is temporarily supplemented by a young doctor (Simon) and his mentally unstable, but very telepathic, younger sister, River. Simon and River are fugitives from the afore-mentioned political hostility, embodied by a sword-wielding man known as ""the Operative"". The crew, the fugitives, the government, and a group of very evil secondary villains called Reavers, provide a magnificent cast of characters whose conflict (and other interactions, but mostly conflict) kept me spellbound for the entire movie.I've long been a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek, but Serenity is better than either.  Reflecting on the movie afterwards, I kept finding similarities to Star Trek: Voyager.  Both shows focus on a small ship and her rag-tag crew. The crews squabble a lot, but ultimately pull together for the common good.  However, I liked Serenity much more than I ever liked Voyager because it was so much more real and alive.  Star Trek has science fiction, and interesting characters.  Star Wars has this plus a nice background mythology and some realistic grittiness.  Serenity includes all of the above, plus humor, more grittiness, sex, theft, and really nasty bad guys.  The result is a realistic universe that people in this messed up world can relate to.In the last few years a lot of science fiction and fantasy movies have had two things:  lots of characters with British accents, and cheesy lines.  Serenity once again leaves its competitors in the dust by transcending all predictability by using fairly neutral, Chinese, and American accents, as well as a British accent from India.  Instead of cheesy lines, it goes for totally-unexpected-and-hilarious, such as: ""Been more'n a year since I had anything twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries!""  There is no denying that the language is odd, and it may take you a while to get used to it.  But stay with the language, because it's so worth listening to!  The odd terminology and turns of phrase drive home the fact that this is not just another sci-fi copy.(Spoiler alert!) A popular phrase in screen-writing these days is ""action that tells the story"". I first remember seeing this concept in The Bourne Identity. Serenity does an even better job because it has an even more interesting motivation for violence, and it juggles multiple action characters. If you've read anything about the history of Serenity you already know that River has some amazing skills. She is also a very attractive young woman. In an average movie, a young male viewer (such as myself) might be inclined to focus on the person on screen more than on her character. In this case, River's character is so incredibly fascinating that you can't help but focus on her character. She is complex, she invokes sympathy, and she has more dimensions than the average human, let alone movie character. Although Malcolm and his crew seem like the main characters of the movie, it is ultimately River who steals the show.  (End spoiler).I've always assumed that if you notice computer graphics in a movie, it is because they are badly done.  Serenity dashed this theory for me.  The three or four times I noticed effects elements, they didn't take center stage or in any way distract from the movie.  They simply communicated the necessary information to the audience and then got out of the way and let the story continue.  The shots of planets were extremely beautiful; an excellent counterpoint to other, more disturbing, images in the movie.As I mentioned before, Serenity has some elements that border on horror.  The filmmakers made an excellent decision when they decided to leave most of the disturbing imagery to the audience's imagination. The Reavers are a hideous and evil ""people"" whose presence could easily have been overplayed for shock value. But the film judiciously cuts around them, never showing more than a glimpse of their horrible faces. In place of these images are lines such as, ""You know he's better off dead than what the Reavers would have done to him."" Once again, the movie is about the characters, rather than about something as superficial as Reaver make-up.I can only think of one negative thing to say about Serenity: There were a few times during big action scenes when two characters would hold an important (and usually emotional) conversation. Obviously, in terms of sound mixing, you have to turn the environmental sounds down so that you can hear the dialog, but I think they went too far.  Two or three times, the contrast of these suddenly quiet conversations broke the mood for me.On the other hand, there was another kind of mood change that I liked a lot. Being a mentally unstable psychic, River expresses a lot of her personality inside her own head. In the medium of film, it is easy to go inside someone's head, and Serenity does a marvelous job of it. I didn't grow up watching movies, so I have often found myself a little confused when movies do things like this. In Serenity it was always crystal clear to me, and the revelations brought by these psychic journeys helped connect the audience to River and her huge part in the story.Serenity is an excellent movie.  It might be a little confusing at first, but if you are a action movie fan or science-fiction fan at all, or if you just like great story-telling, you will like it.Note: For the few who don't know, Serenity is based on the TV series Firefly.  When I watched Serenity, I had never seen Firefly, but I still loved the movie!  Since then, I have watched most of the Firefly series.  All the praise I have given the movie also applies to the TV series."	5.0	Transcends all genres!	2005-11-03	42	39	3
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A16BY2C4J2IZA6	"J. E. Fox ""jazz fan"""	"Serenity is an extension of the Firefly TV series that was cancelled despite a rabid fan base.I never saw the series but the movie is right in line with classic scifi of the fifties. Characters and situations will be familiar to readers of Theodore Sturgeon, Jack Vance, Issac Asimov, etc.The one problem with the movie is a glaring internal logic error familiar to watchers of TV series, where they think no one remembers anything from commercial break to commercial break. this is the character of Summer, the 17-year-old psychic. It is revealed here that she is the product of conditioning, it seems on the world Miranda. At first it seems that she becomes a deadly fighting machine when triggered by a series of visual commands. She is turned off by an aural command her brother knows, having infiltrated the training base where his sister was housed. So far so good, and for most of the movie, this internal logic is followed. But at the end of the movie the Serenity goes to Miranda, and neither Summer nor her brother seem to know anything about the planet or its structures nor do they say anything interesting (like ""this is where I lived""). Then, in the climatic fight scene, Summer just stands up, says ""Now it's my turn"", and goes out and fights all the bad guys, turning on and off her fighting skills at will. Sorry, you can't have it both ways, either her powers are out of her control or they're not. Either Miranda has meaning for her, or it hasn't.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	With the cult fan success of the TV Series Firefly, Joss Whedon's OTHER labor of love (the first being the TV Series Buffy the Vampire Slayer), found life even after cancellation.  In what is a rare occurrence where a TV show is cancelled and then made into a major motion picture Firefly, aptly re-named Serenity, pushed forward and finished on most levels what was started with the intelligent weekly series.Here's a short time line; in the fall of 2002, a new show called Firefly came on the airwaves of FOX television.  It was something of a hybrid.  Part serialized western and part sci-fi adventure and featuring the sharp and witty dialogue that Whedon's fans come to expect.  It was a hit with critics and the few people who watched it.  Unfortunately several factors came into play that clinched it's demise.  FOX barely promoted it, mainly because they didn't like the direction the show started out in the pilot episode.  In a rush, a whole new action oriented episode was created in one weekend and even though it was a good episode, the higher ups obviously didn't like Whedon's `I want to do it my way' approach.  After several successful seasons of producing Buffy and Angel, both very successful shows, you would think the Execs at FOX would give Whedon the creative license to do the show the way he thought it should be done.  Alas, the businessmen thought they knew how to create complex entertaining stories and characters more than anyone else.  With a sour relationship the show was never promoted beyond a few short notices during the sports broadcasts that pre-empted the regular viewings.  In addition, no support was given to Whedon to create the show as a character driven show.  They simply wanted the action variety and nothing else.  They wanted the characters to be the bad-a$$ soldiers.  Whedon wanted to create characters who were flawed and but happen to have skills, some good some bad.  In other words, a balanced character study.  In December of 2002, the show was canceled and the two hour pilot episode was aired as the last show, that statement alone should clue anyone in on the thought process of the Execs at FOX.Whedon swore that Firefly would continue in some way shape or form.  With that, many would hope that the show would be picked up again by another network.  Sci-Fi channel, UPN, WB, fans wished someone would get this show back on the air.  It never happened.  Later in 2003, the DVD box set was released with three unaired episodes, fourteen in all.  It was a hit.  Amazon sales of the DVDs reached records highs and the reviews for the set were consistently in the four or five star range.  Many reviews read with phrases like `I never heard of the show, but I saw the DVDs and loved it.'  Later in 2003, it was confirmed that a major motion picture would be created.  Fans rejoiced.  As the movie went into production and teaser trailers were released, fans salivated and semi-fans were anxious.  Unfortunately the combination of two and the lack luster media coverage didn't amount to great ticket sales.  The movie barely covered it's expenses.  But it was critically hailed as a great movie and anyone who saw it seemed to like it as well.Ok, finally, I get to my synopsis of the movie itself; don't worry if you never saw the show, what you need to know is conveniently condensed into the first ten minutes.  It's a great scene, a testament to Joss' Whedon's writing ability to fit fourteen episodes of story into just a few minutes.  Taking place 500 years in the future, it centers on River Tam, a brilliant young girl who was manipulated by the government for covert purposes.  An Operative is assigned to find River and bring her in, or kill her.  Once past that we are treated to the first shot of Serenity, the ship.  Then we are introduced to it's crew as a long camera shot follows Captain Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) through the entire inner workings, displaying his relationship with each crew member.  It's so efficient and so well done, you can't believe you're entertained at the same time.  The plot continues the main story arc of the TV show as River and Simon Tam are being chased by the Alliance, the unionized Government of the US and Chinese that governs the core planets.  As the Captain picks up a job, this one being somewhat unlawful, they are suddenly attacked by the Reavers, a group of cannibalistic and brutal murders who are feared through out the system.  At the close of the job, River and Simon are expected to leave the ship for good.  When River suddenly goes ballistic in a bar, beating the pulp out of everyone in the place, the operative is tuned in on their location and the chase is on.  Instead of running, the crew find themselves tracking down the source of Rivers outburst.  I don't want to say much more because hopefully I've peaked your interest.  If not, I'll say this; Serenity is a top-notch character study and action/sci-fi adventure that goes, and goes fast.  The actors love their characters and to top that off, the dialogue is excellent.  With such a balanced crew and cast of characters you get a sense that this is a group of people who may not always like each other, but know they have to work together for something greater.The movie ends in surprising ways, Whedon's way of saying, `Maybe there will be a sequel, maybe there won't.'  He can never tell.  But suffice to say, even if he never does anything for the Firefly/Serenity Universe again, at least he got to complete this story and give his fans a glimmer of hope that one day it may rise again.	5.0	Reborn for closure	2007-05-21	4	3	1

But, they usually don't. Serenity is one that really improves with multiple views. We bought the DVD, and re-loved every episode. Don't spend extra on Blu-ray, as the original does not seem to have high enough resolution to make a difference.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AM5X7ZM0HX8XR	"Jennifer Thurman ""Daisies in May"""	Wow, like, what an amazing science fiction masterpiece, huh?  Serenity is the collaboration of the hard work of Joss Whedon, who put together the Firefly series.  Serenity is packed with action and adventure.  I was really glad to see some things happen that helped say goodbye to the series.  The background is kind of a cross between Star Trek and Tombstone!!  I like Kailee and Wash they are my favorite characters by far.  Fun movie that keeps you wanting more!	5.0	The cast is the best I've seen!	2006-02-12	8	7	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2G4ZP63WL9XTC	Jennifer Weeks	Some of you may be skeptical about this DVD.  The cover art is, frankly, rather unwelcoming, and it has no big stars to reassure you that there will be *something* that you'll certainly enjoy.But here's plain speaking.  This is amazing just on a dramatic level.  It made me claw myself in anticipation in places (I'm occasionally high-strung.  Shut up.).  The acting is powerful, and it has layer upon layer of meaning and emotion as one rewatches.  The relationships even in the short span of this film are all fluid, mutable, and it draws you in as you try to understand how there's any possible way for this to end well, or even not-too-horribly.  The arc of Malcolm Reynold's character is a beautiful one, from anti-hero to hero, unwillingly, brought by belief and faith in the people he flies with.  This is a movie about trust, love and loyalty, a movie whose depth of emotion takes your breath away.Buy it.  Now.	5.0	Simply the best film of 2005	2006-01-19	12	11	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2HRQ4G2OVJXT6	Jennika R. Spanarkel	This movie was okay for what it was.  However, it did not meet the standards most fans seemed to have for it.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	Serenity is simply a masterpiece and unique! If it wasn't for my husband raving about it I wouldn't give it a chance. Before then I was contemplating on seeing the film because I had never seen Firefly and didn't know what to expect. Time to time I noticed all the good reviews it was raking in on this site so I finally gave in and I'm glad I did! It may be sci-fi, but this film isn't all sci-fi, it's more action and definitely a comedy as well! The script is just fantastic, the way all these different film elements were combined together are just unbeatable.Basically the crew of Serenity, lead by Captain Mal, are a group of rebels who decide to take along a fugitive named River, plus River's brother Simon. The crew decide to use River to pull off such things as bank robberies, as she can detect if anything bad is about to happen. Mal refuses to surrender River over to anyone, and hence the body count rises! I must admit the story does bog a little over the course of the film, and some of the best characters are killed at the end, but in a film like this you focus on what makes the film so special. And the script was just astounding, that was enough to give this film such a high rating, and is the reason why it is loved so much. The fight scenes and things like that in the film are terrific as well, who would have thought that a film adapted from a TV Series could become so popular, and that a TV director could do such a good job. It is clear that the plot and script were worked on for a great length of time to make it so great, simply nothing was rushed here! The gore in the film may not be so great but there is only small amounts, and not much blood (until the end), but if you don't mind rotting corpses you should be fine.The cast that was pick for this film done very well, Fillion as Mal was believable as the captain. Other members of the cast like Maher and Torres are great as well! Whedon is the star of the day; he has made this film fantastic!In conclusion, Serenity is one of the best films for '05, and is also one of the best sci-fi films ever made! This is a highly recommendable film and you must view.  So I give you an order to march yourself down to your local video store and hire this film if you haven't seen it already, and if you have seen it go and buy it!	4.0	One to place into your DVD collection.	2006-04-21	8	7	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3PB9JXD9BBPQA	"Jeoi J ""Serena"""	"This is a great continuation/ending of the TV show - Firefly. The same cast is back and it's great to see them all together again! The chemistry is still there! Fans of Firefly, you won't be disappointed (well - maybe, you will be disappointed since this is the end of Firefly and some of the incidents that happens in the movie!). If you are a true fan of Firefly, you can't miss this.If you have a Blue-Ray Player, by all means, get the Blue-Ray version. Picture quality is excellent. I first watched this as Video on Demand (not the best way to watch it as video kept on buffering (and I don't think I have slow internet connection)). It was on TV afterward on SyFy. Finally, Blue-Ray of this went on sale and I snatched it up. I am glad I did.Only one complaint is the sound quality of the blue-ray. The background music is louder than the people speaking. If you turn it up to hear the actors/actresses better, the background music is even louder. (Hence, the 4 stars.)Overall, would I buy Serenity Blue-Ray version again? Yes. It's a great movie. Yes, the audio quality isn't the best but the great video quality overrules it.(Here comes my plug for Firefly.)Firefly is even better. Just head over to the ""Firefly"" Amazon page and see for yourself the great reviews it has on it. I was somewhat hesitant b/c of the great reviews but they are all well deserved (if you are a Sci-Fi fan)! If you haven't seen Serenity, Firefly gives you a brief background and history of the crews of Serenity. If you haven't watch Firefly, you will still understand the movie but only  miss the great storyline of the show!Cheers~Joei"	4.0	Great ending to Firefly!	2010-01-11	2	2	0

Which I also thoroughly enjoyed - but that's another review.I bought the Blu-Ray over a year ago, but just barely got around to taking off the shrink wrap a few days ago.  lol  What a great movie!  And the Blu-Ray experience is even better.  The picture looked especially crisp to me, surprising since Universal has a bad reputation for its Blu-Ray offerings.  But the audio...the audio is fantastic.  I really love the soundtrack during the last ~5 minutes of the film, and it sounded AWESOME on my 5.1 setup.If you like sci-fi, you'll like this movie.

The direction was sloppy, the script was overstuffed (clearly he was trying to force every idea he wasn't able to do on tv into the movie), the characters were treated poorly.  And in the end, the swashbuckling element of FIREFLY was completely lost.  For me - and again, this is my opinion, and I realize it's not everyone's - what made FIREFLY great was utterly abandoned.  I felt like Whedon was pissed off at his creation and wanted to savage it.Not that the idea for the film was bad.  Quite the contrary - the Reevers were one of the best things about the show, and getting into their story should have been great.  But ultimately, I was sorely disappointed.	2.0	Disappointing Followup to a Great Series	2007-07-08	125	17	108

There was a brief glimpse of action when River morphed into a Trinity-inspired kung-fu master (Matrix reference).  Other than that, I found this to be a Star Trek inspired knock-off.

I watched it but didn't pay much attention to it and so afterwards I shelved it for awhile.  Then one day, while at home with nothing to do I popped it in again.  That second time I paid attention.  It changed my life.I then ordered Firefly: The Complete Series and I am so sorry I discovered Firefly/Serenity so late.  It may have been a good thing because it would be incredibly painful to have gon ethrough what some other fans have with the abrupt cancellation of this one of a kind series.  Oddly enough, I have fallen so in love with the characters and the story that I feel the pain.In an era of television where there are a set of sci-fo series out there that are not as good but last longer - Firefly's discontinuation is an insult and a clear act of stupidity on the part of network execs who do not know the aesthetic value of art vs. the garbage that plagues TV - especially one so out of the ordinary.Firefly/Serenity is truly a remarkable project.  It is a very smart series.  This is no oridnary science fiction.  It is also, as another reviewer observed, a commentary on socio-political world affairs and our desire to truly be free as a human race.It would be a true travesty if Serenity is the end.  SOmetimes an author or a creator has a certain responsibility to the characters, the universe, and stories around them that they have created.  Maybe even more than the responsibility they have for the fans.  Firefly/Serenity's universe is just to rich, too great, and too special to be left alone.  There is so much more to be done and to be said. This is truly the greatest Sci-Fi series/film I have ever had the honor to see and experience.  I urge Whedon to make this happen again - have Firefly/Serenity continue.	5.0	This MUST NOT be the end Chapter	2007-07-07	21	20	1

The television series is great, but seems to push too many boundaries of good taste and morals (not for kids)and it's understandable why the series was canceled.Even with the problems the series had, it was quite enjoyable and kept you entertained from start to finish.  The movie is a great wrap-up and explains a lot that you missed from the television show.  The movie also relies on the fact that you should already know a lot of the history and understand the characters from the television series.  The two really do go hand in hand.Bottom line:  Watch the television series and then wrap up with the movie.  Very entertaining.*The HD-DVD version of this is very nice and clear.

This is a well structured story with likable characters. While it does not break any ground in the world of literature, the story is not just another retread of old scripts.I have watched this movie five times already. Then I went back and watched the TV series on DVD. Like the original Star Trek, there is a chemistry with the performers that keeps the viewer engaged.

I like Whedon's use of dialogue to build and relieve tension in X-men, and he maintains his ear for good witty dialogue in ""Serenity.""  He also does an excellent job of developing what are essentially comic book characters, and making us care about them and so that when this movie reaches its climax our muscles tense up as we root for our heroes to make it against overwhelming odds.That said, the special effects are really cheesy -- I suppose it's a homage to the campiness of Whedon's style."	4.0	Compelling	2012-09-15	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	"Serenity is a slap in the face to those morons who canceled the show. FOX canceled someone of their best shows like Fastlane, Tru Calling, Futurama, Family Guy and Firefly. They were even dumb enough to cancel Fastlane with a cliffhanger ending and I'm still want to know what happened next. Anyway both Family Guy and Firely got  second chances. Family Guy is back on FOX and Firefly creator Joss Whedon brought his vision back to life on the big screen.I just got into Firefly with the dvd's and sci-fi channel showing re-runs and I don't why I never watched it. It's great fun, with smart dialogue and a nice science fiction/western combination. Whedon does a fine job bringing all that to the big screen. With some better special effects and  more ruthless villians. The actors are up to the challenge too since most of them have been on the big screen before. This movie though will probably get them more starring roles. Nathan Fillion ""the evil and strong priest in the last season of Buffy"" is awesome as Mal, the captain of Firefly. The guy can deliver witty lines well but when  he has to show off the character's dark self-cenered side he's even better. Adam Baldwin (My Bodyguard, Full Metal Jacket, Angel's last season) is equally good as the unpredictable Jayne. You never know what he's gonna say or do.Gina Torres ""who Whedon also used as a powerful villian in Angel season 4"" is great just like she was in the show. She plays Mal's trusted alley who fought in a war with him. She'd follow him anywhere, especially since her husband's the pilot of Serenity. The sexy Summer Glau almost steals the show as River. A psychic who was also turnt into a weapon by scientists. Her being on the ship is a danger to Serenity and it's members since she's wanted all over the galaxy. That was the plot in the show too but it also works in the movie since we never got to learn much about her before the show was canceled. Here Serenity and anyone who has helped it's crew is in threat by a dangerous member of the alliance. He wants River and he won't stop killing until he gets her. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers) is a badass and even scary as the bounty hunter.What makes the movie more unpredictable than the show is that since it's no longer a show, it doesn't matter to Whedon if he kills anyone off. Which helps keep the viewers at the edge of their seats. You have to admire Whedon for not giving up on his vision and going back to it even after the show got canceled. Even if this doesn't get FOX to put the show back on, hopefully we'll still get more movies. Also hopefully Joss has a Angel movie planned for us fans who are still mad at WB for canceling it."	4.0	A Dream come true to Firefly fans	2005-10-02	14	10	4

However, we need to keep in mind that Joss has stated on several occasions the ""Studio"" flexed a lot of their muscle in the outcome, and compromises had to be made.

""It's just another space western"" is the first instinct but at closer review the audience will realize that the characters spring into life as a fully developed family dealing with social and personal conflicts in each episode.  The writing creates a universe where it is a daily chores to fly through space and dock with exotic planets.  At the same time the captain deals with marauding ""space raiders"" and a powerful and controlling central government he must also balance the needs of his crew while they deal with love and jealousy.

She knows a secret that could weaken if not bring down the Alliance which has a firm hold on the central planets.  The crew has to decide what to do with River-push her and her brother off or fight to reveal the secret.  The chemistry between the crew clicks back into gear and all of the great characters make an appearance.  There is a lot of action and it is a great story.

It was OK for TV, but not spectacular; given the choice, I prefer Law and Order reruns. So, no complaint about Firefly other than it wasn't for me. But Serenity, on the other hand, other than the explosions simply wasn't big screen material. The plot is laughable. Teenage psi chick goes berserk, showing herself as part of a central government plot to create an uber weapon out of a 100 pound stick with breasts. She kills a bunch of baddies and, by the end, everything is A-OK. What a surprise.Is it any wonder why this flick flopped? It's less original than popsicles on a stick. Perhaps Whedon could arrange to merge his two pet projects, Buffy and Firefly, into one supershow: Firefly, the Vampire Slaying Space Ship, with Gina Tores as Commander Big Boobs and Sarah Michele Geller as Ms. Woody Staked.Sheesh.Perhaps it's worth a rent for those interested in Firefly.

However, know that this movie stands on its own. You do NOT have to have seen the television series to follow and enjoy this movie. The world-building is detailed and well done. The actors slip very comfortably into their characters (why not after thirteen episodes on Fox?) and you immediately sense the familial atmosphere of the ship. Lots of memorable scenes and lines. After the blast doors close, trapping River with the Reivers -- when they reopen, it is one of the great still shots of any movie. It certainly is a top ten SF movie. Better ones? Bladerunner.

Really as good as watching it in the theater, and as enjoyable.We own the regular DVD of serenity and were very happy with it but after watching it on HD there is no question that we prefer the HD.We played the regular DVD of Serenity right after watching this one and the up processing of the player made the regular dvd looks better than ever  but the HD edition was still has much more detail and superior sound.Some great extras, I think the regular DVD has all of the same features, but I could be wrong.We do wish they would have added a cast commentary for the movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3335LTANZCX78	John Cunningham	"After Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" television series was unfairly canceled back in 2002, fans clamored for a continuation. Joss finally delivered with this theatrical film, ""Serenity"", which ties up as many of the lingering plot threads from the series in the amount of time provided. However, the film still stands well enough on it's own, and could have been the Star Wars of a new generation if it had succeded in the box office.The plot picks up 6 months after the final episode ended, with the United space Alliance still in pursuit of River Tam (Summer Glau), a 17 year old girl whom they experimented on to turn her into a weapon. After being freed by her brother Simon (Sean Maher), the siblings ally themselves with a mercenary named Captain Malcom Renolds (Nathon Fillion) and his crew in their Firefly-class ship named ""Serenity"". The group tries to uncover just what the government did to River, and stumble across a conspiracy that could jeapordize not only their lives, but anyone who comes into contact with them.While watching the film, I noticed that it definately seems smarter than most Summer block busters. I may be biased due to being a Whedon fanboy,but the themese presented in this film seem to be more morally ambigious, which is common in Whedon's work. Even the villain of the film, the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor)believes that what he is doing is for the greater good, and Malcom learns he has more in common with him than he'd like.The cast members give likeable to great performances, particularly Fillion as Reynolds and Glau as River. All in all, it is as satisfying a conclusion that we will ever get to the Firefly universe. No Whedon fan should miss it."	5.0	"The continuation of  the ""Firefly"" series"	2008-02-28	2	1	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3DNKP1E7OZ5IW	John D. Lee 2	In BTVS, Joss Wheedon included a little truthtelling with his US Special Forces hero mind-kontrolled by milspec computer chip run amok on-purpose. In Serenity, Joss goes a step further with his MK-ULTRA plotline, with torturous mind-kontrol used on his fem fatal, as a government-made assassin, complete with trigger words for her handlers. This plotline needs to be investigated more by Hollywood, and Congress, and US courts. That's probably why Fox killed Firefly, for reasons of National Security. Just ask Cathy O'Brien. Truthteller Alex Jones of Infowars radio reported he enjoyed this movie, perhaps because he has interviewed so many real characters who lived that portion of Serenity's plot. Perhaps the most endearing aspect of Wheedon's BTVS/Angel and Firefly/Serenity are the background plot of psychopathic homicidal government run amok.

However, this was an exceptional movie, and I never watched the Firefly TV series.  I originally saw this movie in theater and the audience response was amazing.  People clearly loved this movie.  The only audience response I can compare this to was from the original star wars theatrical release.  Besides the love of those first three star wars movies I have never experienced such love and energy for a movie.  Rumor has it that if this movie does well there will be two more to follow and possibly after that a continuation of the TV series.

Plus, I didn't know anything about the series it was based on, so I expected to, at best, not get the in-jokes, and at worst to be totally lost w/regard to the plot.Instead, this turned out to be one of the most pleasant surprises in a while.  They managed to convey the essentials of the characters and plot very early on, and the humor was fully enjoyable.  Don't get me wrong --- I intend to watch all the Firefly episodes and then watch this again, but the episodes are definitely not a prerequisite.Best of all was the INTELLIGENCE of the characters.  How many movies have you seen where the plot depended on characters acting like dummies most of the time, not seeing very obvious ramifications of actions or events?  This was such a refreshing change --- everyone in the movie was smart, and surprises to the characters were surprises to the viewer as well.I never heard of ""Firefly"" while it was on.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1Q4MNIUESQTBM	John Schultz	I loved the firefly series. There was a lot of potential for numerous episodes to be made but in FOX's wisdom they thought some more reality TV is what was needed. FOOLS! All I can say about Serenity the movie is that it destroyed so many plot-lines I can only hope that this adventure took place years in the future of the show. That would allow them to tell all of the stories correctly. There is no accurately established time line so I guess it would be possible. All of the original characters from the series are here but in the movie version they seem a bit different. Some of the things the characters do and say just don't fit what was established in the TV series. and Kaylee has lost about 20lbs (which is also a shame!) Even after this movie there is SO MUCH left untold we should still expect more episodes. This movie would fit better in the 'verse only if they fill in the massive gap between the last show and serenity. It is definitely worth watching but it's finality may just piss you off too.	3.0	This movie pissed me off. and yet I give it 3 stars.	2006-02-25	8	2	6

One great thing about the show was that most of the episodes were nicely self-contained, and they didn't have to tell the whole story in one show.  And they were always driven by a micro-plot instead of trying to squeeze the whole story in one segment.The movie was a great way to tie the loose ends of the series together, but I think in the process it lost something.  I didn't find the dialogue half as witty as on the TV show.  The effort to answer the unanswered questions really became strained at times.  I think if I'd stumbled across this movie without having first watched the fantastic series, I would not have enjoyed it as much.	3.0	Eh, not such a great stand-alone movie.	2006-08-18	24	14	10
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A34U6HKNYZPVZL	"John T. Forde ""Jaytee"""	"I've read some of the other reviews both positive and negative on here. I'd like to point out one negative one that was horribly innacurate but I won't mention the poster. The person misspelled so many words I wondered if English was his second language and possibly barely understood it. In his review he confuses the names of characters so often I wondered if he was even paying attention throughout the movie. There are many people out there who like sci-fi movies. Some only like the simple scientifically innacurate schlock that comes in movies where some goofy alien talks like a Rastafarian and ships exploding in space make noise even though sound doesn't travel in a vacuum. For the rest of us that like a certain amount of realism, grit and depth of characters movies like Star Wars don't cut it. Serenity is more than just a sci-fi action film. It contains subtleties that would escape obvious low intellectual capacity of the writers of most of the negative reviews. I have to say in fairness some very astute people may not ""get it"" or like it because their tastes run to something else but in my own opinion based on watching hundreds of films and reading thousands of sci-fi novels (at least a 1/3 of which were recycled ideas or just plain plagiarism)this movie is just plain excellent to both entertain and amuse you. The characters have depth and while the movie is only two hours compared to the Firefly series where the characters had more time to be revealed it still does a fine job. The universe in which Joss Whedon placed his characters has an Old West feel to it, kinda scruffy and not too tidy, which makes it more convincing to me than all the gloss and glitter of Star Wars since it is after all a frontier like the Old West but set in the 25th century in another star system. The action sequences are fast moving and the plot is strong. One of the negative reviewers said that they expected more from the movie given it's huge production budget. This movie only cost 39 million to make and yet the special effects rival some movies that cost over 100 million and still stank so I can only conclude the negative reviewer was either smoking something funny, a complete moron or just didn't check his or her facts. I'd say give this movie a chance and if you don't buy it at least rent it someplace. I'm sure the majority of you once you see it would want to add it to your collection. I'd also strongly recommend the Firefly boxed set which contains the first and only season and watch it in the proper order as contained in the set, not in the brain dead micromanaged order that the same pinhead at Fox that cancelled the show insisted the show be broadcast in. That had as much to do with the low ratings the show recieved as the fact that Fox placed it in a doomed to fail timeslot for a sci-fi series. When I see how many quality shows Fox has produced only to undermine them and then cancel them to the ire of fans I find myself wondering why they are in the entertainment business at all. I can only praise Universal for making this movie but wished they had done a better job of marketting it as it would have improved the box office gross. I hope they do a sequel or that the Sci Fi channel picks up the rights and does a mini-series or two so I can continue to buy DVDs that feature this rich and realistic view of the future that Joss Whedon created."	2.0	Can't understand some people	2005-12-25	41	13	28
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2J2DPF8G1L9GI	John Towler	I did not see the TV series before I watched this movie so did not have any pre-conceptions (other than I like Josh Whedon's stuff and was a big Buffy fan).The movie is extremely good and well worth watching.  The movie and it's plot have all been described in great detail by other reviews and I won't repeat them here.  My only problem with the movie was difficulty understanding the dialogue sometimes.  The characters have their own patois that was hard to follow at first (nothing like speaking in Klingon, but enough where it threw me off occassionally).  I had to turn on the captioning to make sure I understood what was being said until I got the hang of it.  It didn't bother me:  I thought it was original and gave another futuristic flavor to the movie.If you are looking for a good movie that will stay with you longer than the butter on your fingers from your microwave popcorn, check out Serenity.	4.0	To Serenity and Beyond!	2006-02-07	6	6	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2E62L4J2JLWH0	"JoJoJava ""not your average Jo"""	"I fell in love with the expertly drawn characters and snappy dialogue of ""Firefly"" when it belately appeared on the SciFi Cable channel. Having grown up on Star Trek:TOS, I watched the spin-offs with my kids - along with all the Star Wars productions, but nothing galvanized my interest the way the original Star Trek series did until ""Firefly"" came along. Every show was smart, thought-provoking, and better the second time around. The attention to detail in both the set and the character performances surpassed anything in its genre. ""Serenity,"" the ship, contributed more of her identity to the overall experience than any of her predecesors. Captain Reynold's unabashed love for his ship, wonderfully revealed in ""Out of Gas,"" made the closing scene in ""Serenity,"" the movie, particularly satisfying and memorable.For those who crave smart science fiction, both ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" are rich treasures to mine time and again. The ""Firefly"" series is so indelibly impressed on my psyche that I must admit some minor plot deviations in the movie caused some initial pain; and yes, there were evident signs of a rushed production. Whedon simply did not have the time for the attention to detail  he obviously brought to each ""Firefly"" production. More's the pity. But for the time and budget he did have, Whedon did an admirable job that well rewarded his ""Firefly"" fans. And Joss finally got to show us the edgier, darker Mal he originally envisioned as Captain Reynolds.Since the movie lacked time for the clever nuances of character and humor that richly graced the series, I fear the wonderful character of Kaylee may have came off to the uninitiated as little more than a bitter whiner. Her's was the most neglected role in the movie, failing to do her memorable characterization of the perky ship's mechanic justice. And, of course, we didn't get near enough of Book.In point of fact, it just wasn't possible for the movie to give starved fans everything they wanted. That would have necessitated a twelve hour movie with properly fleshed out characters and not a single scene or line of dialogue left out.Over time, I have come to question Whedon's judgement on the need to kill off a major character, much less two. Not only did he destroy one of the most interesting couples relationships ever portrayed on screen, he deprived future stories of Wash's folksie warmth - a trait that balanced the sometimes overtly hard lines of other characters. And Ron Glass's ""Shepherd Book"" certainly deserved a longer shelf life.We may never see a ""Firefly"" series again - one that reflects the same attention to detail as the first, that fills in the timeline between the last show and the movie. It's cancelation makes the drivel endlessly offered up in CableWorld all the more mystifying. SciFi Channel is now broadcasting ""Passions,"" but not scrambling for rights to give ""Firefly"" a second shot?!? Space monkeys obviously run the corporate end of television.Unfortunately, moviegoers who never viewed the complete ""Firefly"" series were deprived of a full understanding of Whedon's characters. ""Serenity"" gave you a decent idea of ""who,"" but failed to fully deliver a sufficient ""why.""That being said, I watched ""Serenity"" twice the weekend it opened and again the following weekend. I have subsequently viewed my widescreen DVD version of the movie many times over. Never has ""Serenity"" failed to deliver an uncommonly enjoyable experience."	5.0	Post season impact	2006-02-03	10	8	2

He sets the bar higher for all of us writers.  He has shown how truly outstanding movies and television can be.I saw ""Serenity"" on opening night and was engrosed.  Returning to these very three dimensional characters was of course exciting.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AE7WANIFGFXEW	Jonathan Goh	Having not watched Firefly before seeing Serenity, going into the theatre I expected yet-another-scifi-movie. Boy was I wrong. I got Serenity - the best movie ever made.The writing is stellar and the acting sublime, the directing is top-notch (naturally) and the plot pure genius. And that was the most shocking thing - Serenity surprised me. The characters are funny and spontaneous, neither overdone nor contrived. They are not drawn from stereotypes or cliches - they are entirely original, entirely new. The many plot twists are novel, and will catch you off your guard. Even the action sequences are original - they ooze with a style and elegance never before seen.Most of all, however, Serenity is pure fun from start to finish. Despite the deep and relevant themes explored in the movie, there is no Star Trek-style pretension. Rather, it is a moviegoer's movie, like a fun old western with actual (amazing) plot and dynamic, round characters.If my words don't resound with you, prospective buyer, then hear the math: an average review of 5 stars from 45 reviewers (and counting) is outrageously high. We can't all be wrong.	5.0	By far, the best and most original movie ever.	2005-11-03	22	21	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3KZ7OH4VRL048	Jonathan	"Thank god for ""Serenity,"" because it nicely wraps up most of the questions that were left hanging when the series that spawned it, ""Firefly,"" was abruptly canceled. In an extremely tight storyline, the ""Firefly"" story wraps up nicely, and the loose ends left are either intentionally left that way for effect or are relatively minor.That is also the greatest weakness of ""Serenity"" - without the foreknowledge from the series, the plot picks up in medias res, and you end up wondering how a lot of things came to be. The main villain, who wields a sword (anachronistic but cool), seems kind of tossed in at the last minute, and though he fleshes out nicely at the end, I can't shake the feeling that he was somehow fake (and strikingly similar to the villain from the final episode of ""Firefly"").That said, this DVD is full screen, and suffers for it - get the widescreen edition. The extras are plentiful and include a fun Joss Whedon commentary, deleted scenes and a few outtakes.My advice: watch a few episodes of ""Firefly"" first. You'll find out if this is up your alley and you'll get some much-needed backstory."	4.0	A good movie that really depends on the series	2009-04-06	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A33EKE035LAYJC	Jonathan Schmoll	"Sci-fi doesn't get much better than Serenity.  You'll find great action sequences, an intriguing plot, a cast who obviously loves their characters, and wonderfully original dialogue (I'm looking at *you* George Lucas).  Serenity is one of those movies that transcends the genre, like The Matrix.  Even if you don't like sci-fi, you'll find something to love in Serenity.Based on the ""failed"" television series 'Firefly', Serenity takes place six months after the last episode in the series.  I say ""failed"" in quotes because after gross mismanagement of the series by Fox, Firefly came into its own on DVD, garnering a large, rabid fanbase (fans of the series are affectionately called Browncoats).  It continues to be one of Amazon's top DVD sellers.I highly recommend picking up the DVD box set of Firefly before digging into this movie.  I know that sounds like a big commitment.  ""You mean to tell me I have to watch 13 episodes of a failed TV show before I can watch this movie?!""  What I'm saying is that the show is incredible (although give it until about episode 8.  True love will set in.  Trust me.)  If you're even remotely interested in this movie, you're doing yourself a disservice by not watching the show.That being said, I think Serenity stands on its own.  It has one of the most compelling villians I've seen in a sci-fi film (no sneering, every-action-movie-you've-ever-seen-villians here).  The cast is largely unknown, and I think that helps the movie because you don't have any preconceived notions about the actors.  The world is an original mash-up of American and Chinese culture, with a bit of the wild west thrown in for good measure.  The story, while generally sticking to sci-fi standards, is filled with little detailed touches of brilliance you haven't seen in a sci-fi movie since, well.. maybe the original Star Wars.How about one of the opening scenes: The camera follows Mal as he walks around the ship, interacting with the crew.  The whole thing happens in one long shot, introducing you to the characters and giving you a feel for the ship.  Brilliant!  Look for the scene where Mal and Zoe are arguing in a corridor.  Notice the sound and lighting change, ever so subtly, and then let it sink in as to why.  How cool is that?  Look for the scene where River is on the verge of panic and prays ""Please God, make me a stone.""  I love the dialogue in this movie.  It's witty and natural and funny as hell.My guess is that most of the people reading this review are already fans.  But if you haven't seen this movie yet, do it.  We're always happy to have another Browncoat."	5.0	Best.  Sci-fi movie.  Ever.	2005-11-02	32	30	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A27LIR97NL771A	jonathon w bernard	Oh, Serenity. You could have been one of the greats. You could have ushered in a new media model for sci-fi entertainment, showing how a mishandled network show could excel on the grander stage of the silver screen.Instead of standing on its own feet, Serenity comes across as a Cliffs Notes version of what would have been the next couple of seasons of Firefly. There are great moments, but overall, the results are diluted, choppy, and do not live up to the Firefly legacy.	3.0	I love Firefly, but I only like Serenity--and only most of it	2013-11-02	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AU3GYRAKBUAEU	Jon Norris	"This film is a continuation of the Firefly TV series, axed in its prime by  TV network executives who just didn't get it.For details about the series, search for the Firefly DVD set here on Amazon, and read the reviews (mine first, of course!) Buy them both, but watch the series first! You will enjoy it more that way.The story line is about a spaceship full of interesting characters squeaking past the law, trying to live free and do the right thing whenever possible. This film picks up a short time after the last TV episode, Objects in Space, and follows on very nicely with the story arc of the series.To go into the story very deeply would give away too much. Suffice it to say that many of the smaller story arcs from the series (avaliable on Amazon in a boxed set) are resolved, and the series put to rest with a finish that would have made a beautiful season ender. There is an opening for more movies/projects based on the same ""verse,"" (short for Universe, show slang for the extremely interesting world/society/galaxy Joss and company created for the series). This 'verse consists of a blend of the old American West, Chinese culture (people speak Chinese and English interchangeably), old West technology and future space travel and related technology.One would think the blend would simply not work, but it does work, and it works unbelievably well. The characters draw you in instantly, and hold your attention through the entire series and movie, leaving you wanting more. I have watched Serenity (the movie - the first section of the DVD series set is also called Serentiy, but is different) so many time I have lost count (not as much as Howard Hughes watched Ice Station Zebra, rest assured, but lots). (Which reminds me - the recent movie about Hughes is also great.)In the movie you will see some things clarified, some things teasingly dangled in front of you and then buried (for future projects?), and at least two primary parts of the story arc resolved. It will make you laugh and cry, be happy and angry, leaving you feel very much a part of the lives of the characters. I won't give you details about the story line because that would take too much of the fun away. Great surprises and twists in store!I haven't been a Joss Whedon fan before, but I sure am now. I am going to go back and visit his previous series and see what I have been missing. I complain frequently that there is little or no good TV being made, but Joss proves me wrong. I just haven't found enough of his work. I am also going to keep an eye out for the actors in other projects, as they are all great as well.Remember, I recommend you get this movie with the Firefly series and watch the series first. This movie really ought to be packaged together with the series, and I would love to see a boxed set with both, and some new featurettes. The extras included with the movie and the Firefly series are also interesting and leave you wanting more."	5.0	outstanding film follows up on Firefly series	2006-10-22	2	2	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3GRN6J64F2C3X	Joseph P. Menta, Jr.	"Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" is a wonderfully entertaining science fiction adventure that will fly by as you're watching it.  Like all great SF movies, the action and special effects serve the story and the characters, not the other way around.  Having said that, however, when the action and effects kick in, they really kick in.  There are terrific chases, space battles, and confrontations, as well as all kinds of other surprises.Those surprises, by the way, include some very clever revelations about the mysteries introduced in the short-lived but much missed ""Firefly"" television series, where the movie's characters were introduced.  For that reason, you might want to pick up the inexpensively-priced ""Firefly"" boxed set (you get all the show's episodes in the one set) and watch them before diving into ""Serenity"".  By all means, you don't need to do that- there's a painless and even clever re-cap of the show's major happenings in the movie's opening minutes- but why miss out on the fun of the show before enjoying the movie?Also, getting to know the characters by watching the show first will give added impact to some of the movie's major dramatic moments.  But be warned, that added impact won't always be of the happy variety, as Mr. Whedon believes that in order to generate genuine tension in a danger-filled adventure like this one, the viewer has to see that not everyone will make it out alive.  That's all I'll say on that score.  Well, I'll also say this: As well as directing the movie, ""Serenity"" was also written by Joss Whedon, so you know you'll be getting some funny stuff here, too.The DVD offers a sharp, clean widescreen image, and there are many interesting, fun extras, including a chatty, informative commentary track by Mr. Whedon.  This is one of my favorite DVDs, and I bet you'll like it, too."	5.0	An excellent continuation of an excellent SF television series	2006-04-24	7	7	0

Somebody who gets other people killed...""The characters of firefly are easy to love, not because they are good guys, but because they are flawed...because they are tainted.  Before this movie, none of them had trancended to the level of hero within an episode(exception - mal//Zoe at the beginning of the pilot, before their cause died).They've played the noble villains enough times, true.  They've given back stolen goods that they realized were in dire need. They've rescued each other time and time again, out of love and loyalty.  They even protected a whore with a heart of gold, but more out of personal admiration and affinity than for any cause.This movie throws them in the center of something too big for themselves, but in that center they find a cause so worth fighting for, they willingly put themselves and their loved ones on the line for it. It's for that bravery, that selflessness, that they all transcend into heroes. Of course, such a journey is bittersweet.  The price is high.  Karma has no place in this universe.  thankfully, Serenity does."	5.0	Firefly goes Epic, and the characters go Mythic	2005-12-10	10	9	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A34DVC04DZQ0C0	"Joshua Davis ""in Wonderland"""	-- First of all, I must start by explaining that I absolutely love the Firefly TV series. The series is a truly creative concept with a cast and crew that feel as human as we are. I have watched and re-watched all of the episodes and they have yet to lose their flavor.-- This is my warning to anybody with a desire to watch this movie *because* of the TV series. You might be disappointedly entertained.-- The biggest problem I had with Serenity is that the characters do not feel the same. Simon is more vocal, aggressive, and has a slight variation to his past. The captain is too head-strong and seems to care a lot less about his crew. The quirkiness of some of the other cast seems to be lost in the transition from a series to a movie. The cast just didn't seem to bond as well in Serenity. Without spoiling anything, there are other issues that leave a bad taste in your mouth by the time you are done watching the movie. Things you simply wish that had not been done.-- Serenity does at least answer a few questions, although it's kind of up to you whether you even wanted those questions answered. Some of what made Firefly so fun to watch was that there WERE questions without answers.-- Overall, was it worth watching? Yes, if only to see that one last journey with the crew of Serenity, but do so with a forgiving eye.	3.0	Not quite the same feel as the Firefly series...	2006-03-09	10	4	6
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3L9EHMEM1UW9M	"Joshua Eyre ""LinePlaneVolume"""	Serenity is what going to the movies, in the classic sense, is all about. It's a popcorn flick with brains and you can't ask for much more than that. Don't let anybody fool you into thinking that the new Star Wars movies are better and this is a rip off of that series. Star Wars is itself based on archetypes that have been played out over and over again in stories for centuries. The classic and strong storytelling elements devolved into an empty shell of its former self.On a much lower budget, this little movie has all of the meat and potatoes of a good space opera... adventure, humor, tragedy, heroics, and conflict. Serenity does not compromise its ensemble cast by dulling all of the rough edges. They're all cast-offs running from the long arm of the law (the Alliance), barely scraping by, and wearing their shortcomings on their sleeves. Translation: Interesting characters who drag you, the viewer, through a lot of great stuff with some shocking surprises.Give this movie a chance, pay to see it, and tell your friends. Enough business might bring it back from TV purgatory, which would definitely be a good thing.	4.0	Plain old fun	2005-10-21	9	8	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1U74I9FWDMGEW	Joshua	I was a bit skeptical when I learned that Firefly would be transferred to the big screen, but I should know by now not to doubt the Whedon.  Set shortly after the end of the television show, Serenity seamlessly movies us into a marvelous capstone for the series we all fell in love with.  Serenity answers many of the questions that have plagued fans since the show met its untimely end, and provides a hopeful and energizing send-off to a wonderful group of characters.  Otherwise, the packaging is pretty cool, and the extra features are highly entertaining to watch after the fact.  I have seen the non-collector's edition and I my preference is this version.For those who have not seen Firefly fear not, for I have had people tell me that it is a good stand-alone movie.  If, however, you are willing to buy, rent, or borrow the series first I would highly recommend it as it will illuminate many aspects of the movie that may otherwise feel foreign.  Either way you are doing yourself a favor by checking it out.	5.0	A well made end to a wonderful franchise	2008-11-30	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2NCNY938F4ZZX	Joshua Siegal	"If you like space ships and awesomeness, you'll have a blast.  The action is fresh and exciting.  The twists are genuinely shocking.  And the one-liners will actually make you laugh!  So many blockbusters feel like a lazy assembly line of explosions and pretty actor faces.  In Serenity, the characters are charming and cool, but also behave like real people, which is so so rare in a blow-things-up movie.  It's fun stuff.Also, don't just take my word for it.  In addition to a million other great reviews, New York Magazine just named it one of the Top 3 movies of 2005.  They called it ""The Year's Best Underrated Movie.""  And that's compared to ALL MOVIES, not just the ones in space.Finally, it's been said before, but it bears repeating: If you sorta wished there was a Han Solo in these last three Star Wars movies... Serenity is a movie with all Han Solos.  I know that's high praise, but there it is.Give it a shot, via Amazon or the rental racks.

This is possibly the best sci-fi series of the past twenty years.  I eagerly awaited Serenity, and hoped it would cause the series to be revived.Well, as soon as I saw the movie (on the first day) I knew it wasn't going to happen.  The movie is a little too intense and frenetic for non-fans to follow, in my opinion.  While it was fun (and I'm sure I'll pick up more details after watching the DVD a few times), I didn't come away thinking it was a classic by any means.  So, four stars.  There ya go, a Firefly fanboy who doesn't automatically give the movie five stars.Nonetheless, it would be great if the series came back.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3HN0Y7CHW56JP	J.R. Broadwater	I know that the above statement is a rather bold claim, and one that's been made many times over. However, this time, it rings true for all those who take the chance and see the movie.I wasn't a fan of the T.V. show when it aired on Fox. To be honest I scoffed at the idea, and considering I couldn't stand Buffy or Angel, I stayed away despite what I'd heard to the contrary. Then I heard that they were making a movie based on the T.V. show, and it got me interested enough to give the show a try through Netflix. Let me tell you now: Firefly is the best television show I've ever seen.I'm a professional sci-fi/fantasy writer so I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan in general. Firefly had me hooked. I loved it. The writing is darn near perfect, as is the acting. The storytelling is just so well done, and Joss carried that over and stepped it up a notch with Serenity.I've been a Star Wars fan since before I could talk. I was raised on it, along with Star Trek and everything else under the sun. I own every Star Wars book- have read them all at least twice. I've seen the movies hundreds of times. Joss said that with Serenity he was aiming to give the audience that feeling he had when he first saw Star Wars, even if they haven't ever seen the show. In my opinion, he accomplished that goal. Lets put it this way: As huge a Star Wars fan (and comic nerd for that matter) as I am, Serenity is the best movie I've seen all year. It beat out Revenge of the Sith. It beat out Batman Begins. So trust me, even if you've never seen a single episode of Firefly, give Serenity a shot.	5.0	Has the Potential to Be This Generation's Star Wars	2005-09-30	25	24	1

Rosenbaugh ""rbaugh"""	"Before I really get started, I need to give a warning to the casual movie fan: WATCH THE TV SERIES ""FIREFLY"" FIRST!  I only say this because the first time I watched Serenity, my girlfriend and I had absolutely no clue what was going on, and we didn't much like the movie.  Well, I enjoyed it alright, but it took me 3/4 of the film just to understand what was up and which characters to take seriously, etc...  I did, however, purchase the ""Firefly"" DVDs when Amazon had them on sale, and I have since seen every episode and re-watched Serenity.  After having seen the TV show, I LOVE the movie.Having said all of that, Serenity is fabulous!  It really is a shame that Fox has cancelled another great series because this really is a great world Joss Whedon has created, and with his talent, the show was only to get better.  (Note: I'm also a huge fan of Whedon's work in comics.  He deserves props for his work on Astonishing X-Men which earned him an Eisner award this year, which is proof of his excellent story telling.)"	5.0	It's sad the series is over...	2006-07-29	3	3	0

I like Joss Whedon and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but I just never got around to it, and then it got cancelled.  Thus, I do not know what information in Serenity is new to the movie, and what is already-established lore from the show.  Judged on its own merits, Serenity is a pretty-good film.  Some of the reviews I've read claim that it is better than Star Wars.  This is drastically overstating things - especially since the ""hero"" bears more than a passing resemblance to Han Solo.  This movie has more in common with Star Trek - also based on a TV series.  It isn't as much concerned with creating a new mythology, the way Star Wars is - it's about the continuing adventures of a crew of a pirate ship.  As such, I felt slightly anti-climaxed by the movie; it wasn't an earth-shattering experience - it was just a good, exciting story with good characters, exciting fight scenes, and snappy dialogue"	4.0	Serenity Now!	2005-10-03	11	6	5

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ARLKYF9JL3QKB	J. SHARP	"I'm a Joss Whedon fan but not a browncoat. I'd never seen Firefly and was a bit skittish about going into Serenity knowing none of the backstory. But by and large it didn't hurt. I'm sure there'd be much more subtext to many parts of the film but it stands fairly well on its own. My only gripes are about some scenes in which you cannot understand the dialog (and I'm not talking about the Chinese bits!)I am somewhat amused but mostly dumbfounded by people saying ""If Serenity were any good, it would have made more money in theaters. Therefore, why bother seeing it?"" That's so foolish. It's like saying the big, delicious hamburgers at the corner diner can't be better than a Big Muck because if they were they'd be selling billions of the diner burgers instead. Well, just because one product has better marketing and more people consume it doesn't mean it's of higher quality.Another thing that bothers me is the unknown actor factor. One reviewer here gave Serenity's cast an unintentional back-handed compliment by saying, ""Even though I knew virtually nobody from the movie ... the fact that I was unfamiliar with most of them did not bother me."" This mindset (""Even though they weren't overused famous people, they did alright"") is at the heart of why good movies rarely get made and also why you see the same 15 actors in every major studio release. The average moviegoer, when given a selection of movies to attend, doesn't ask ""What's it about?"" or ""What happens in it?"" They ask ""Who's in it?"" as if that will automatically make it good or bad. It's obvious that many people looked at Serenity's ads, saw no recognizable names, and said ""What else is on?"" This killed its box office take. If Whedon had recast it with Owen Wilson as Mal, Halle Berry as Zoe, and Ashlee Simpson as River it would have done three times the business. But it would not have been a better movie. It would have been worse. They aren't right for those roles! Familiar faces can get in the way of the story. You end up watching their prepackaged persona, not the character as it was imagined. For example, in The Fugitive (which I liked by the way) you never once felt you were watching a medical doctor on the lam. You were watching ""Harrison Ford"" fighting bad guys.My point is this: Don't follow the media hype. Try the diner down the street versus the prefab burger joint. You may like it. You may not.

The story in this movie is so original, and yet something we can all relate to.

It's part sci-fi, part action/adventure, part western, part comedy, part romance/drama, part zombie-movie.  Zombie-movie isn't really a genre, but is should be.  I guess we can say 'horror,' even though I wouldn't.Anyways, my point is, it's a blend of genres.  None will deny this; one common complaint among the negative reviews was just that: it would go from comedy to horror in an instant.  I guess they found that perturbing.I mention negative reviews; they're rare.  Positive reviews constitute the vast majority, I assure you.  But don't take my word for it - I'm a convicted felon! Look this flick up yourself on [...], or the review site of your choice.  You'll see.Anyways, if you buy this movie and watch it, you'll like it.  I guarantee it*.

Some people mentioned a few problems, such as the level of technology (suggesting that technology wouldn't be that high in 500 years... to which I respond, look at how far technology has come in the past 50 years, and it's accelerating exponentially.  I don't think that level in 500 years is a stretch at all), character development (I felt pretty comfortable with who these people were by the end of the movie) and being confused if you haven't seen the series.In response to the final point, I haven't seen the series but didn't feel at all confused to the point of distraction.  I felt the necessary things to know were explained well enough and at appropriate times.

The TV show is like a movie in itself.  If you haven't seen the TV show which is not on anymore but you can still see this movie an be ok.

The movie has a different voice and a different tone than the tragically short-lived series (Firefly), but the inner workings brought to life by cast and crew are just as fantastic. People like to talk about having ""heart"" - in sports, film, business, etc. - and Serenity has that, but what puts it in a higher class is its soul. Serenity has blood and sweat and bone and brains and heart in abundance (and yes, some of that is actual rather than metaphorical - it IS PG-13) but it also has a higher purpose. It doesn't preach and it doesn't push, but it questions. Religious questions, moral questions, political questions, all asked in such an unobtrusive way that it looks like pure entertainment. It isn't until you can't stop talking about it that you realize it has a deeper effect. Serenity is one of those movies I could watch over and over and never get tired of it.

"I've never seen the television series Firefly everyone is talking about, but, I found this movie to be very interesting.I would say it's similar to star wars without the light swords.  The human race doesn't exist only on earth. There is a galactic alliance and the government is training human children to be the ""perfect weapon"" using brainwashing and mind control.  One girl is rescued by her brother who breaks in to save her only to find they would spend much of their life running from an assassin.  What does this girl know that the government is  trying to hide?  Can they make it to the outer planet without getting attacked and eaten alive by the human consuming reevers?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3G9Y272V9WTS9	just Chris	"More accurately I've read every page of reviews here and carefully read each and every one with on or two stars.  As you can see by what I rated the movie I don't need anybody telling me how good it is, but I do need some perspective on what isn't good about it.I did not find that perspective, while several people were kind enough to tell me, ""IT SUCKED"" few elaborated and most of those that didn't tell the truth.  I'm not accusing anyone of lying here, but when someone points out that the princess is stereotypical when there is no princess (nor royalty of any kind) it seems a bit odd.  When people talk about the two factions ruling humanity and there are not two factions, that seems odd to me.When someone went into great detail about how the movie was unrealistic because of heat shield failure never taking into account that there is no mention of a heat shield in the entire movie that was a little strange.  This isn't limited to people here, a professional reviewer made reference to a nuclear war that never happened.The list goes on, and here's the point: You have to pay attention to this movie.  I understand that it can be nice to have a movie playing in the background, but this isn't the movie to do it with because it looks like everyone who's tried somehow managed to remember things that didn't happen.If you want some help getting your bearings move a little bit down the post and I'll give you some background in case you miss it, though I don't see how you can if you are paying attention.There were also a couple of ""rabid fans"" who felt let down or betrayed, and about three reviews that actually gave reasons why the person didn't like it that applied to the movie.  I think the problem was that they had the wrong ideas going in.This movie is not about gigantic antiseptic spaceships with flashy lasers.  (It is actually about people, nine of them to be exact.)  It is also not about the people who captain such great ships, the characters are on a small old ship, they don't have gigantic state rooms because they couldn't afford it.  In fact when the movie starts they're in a bad place trying not to worry about whether they can afford to keep the ship in repair and whether they'll be able to buy food.Some of the planets are still in the process of being settled which means there are not yet incredible buildings with blinking lights, but instead people working off the land until they can afford the blinky lights.In this movie you will not find aliens or evil empires.You also won't find stock characters, just like with real people if you try to fit one of the characters into a convenient category you will fail.  If you don't believe me then try, watch the movie, find the category you think fits best for each character, then watch it again with that in mind.  The stereotype won't fit because no one is that simple in either real life or the movie.Someone complained that he didn't know whether to think of one character as funny or tough, they were trying too hard to pigeonhole the character, real people are both funny and tough.  Real people make jokes when bad things are happening also.About five minutes ago I told someone I didn't want to call Serenity the ""best"" movie because best is so subjective of a word, however it is the only one in nay genre that made me want to go out and tell people about it.  She said that's the highest complement you can give, maybe she's right, maybe she's wrong, but it is important.If you want to understand how good the movie is, without watching it, you can't look at box office returns or sales figures, not matter how good or bad they are (I don't know which they are), you need to look at how it effects people.  Look at how much people care about this movie, the people didn't magically do that on their own, it is because the movie is that good.There is a reason that we get reports of 90 year old women coming to and loving a movie that most would peg (incorrectly) as something for 15 year old boys.  (Don't get me wrong the 15 year olds like it too.)  There's a reason that fans come from all ages in between, that fans are not limited by their politics or nationalities, that fans are not even limited by genre.People who say, ""I hate sci-fi,"" love this.People who say, ""I love sci-fi,"" love this.People in between love it too.If you want my advice go out and buy it, make sure you get widescreen.If you want more rational advice here it is: If something can create fans who care so much, if it can appeal to people, male and female, from all age groups, if it can do all of that isn't it worth at least renting to see how it managed that?The rational thing, the logical thing, is to go out and give it a chance.  Rent it, give it your full attention, watch it at least twice to know whether or not you really got it the first time around, and if you like it come back here and buy it.  If you don't like it please come here and say why, and please, if you cite examples, cite ones that are really from the movie.The thing coming from someone who's already seen it is this: I can honestly say that I believe that if you do that you will come back here and buy it.  Maybe write a review better than mine while you're at it.--I said that I'd try to help you through the back-story because some people seem to get it confused even though I think it is very clear.  The problem is that this will take a lot of words and not do the movie any justice.The earth could no longer support the all of the people on it and the major technological and economic powers teamed up to jump ship as soon as a new home could be found.  That new home was a solar system full of worlds and moons that could be teraformed.As happens in real life here on earth some people prospered and others didn't, those that prospered were on the ""Central Planets"" and they formed an interplanetary parliament called the Alliance with the goal of bringing light, order and democracy to all worlds, as in real life other people didn't like the idea of people from some foreign land (planet) telling them what to do and there was a war.  Outnumbered and outgunned the Independents (also known as Browncoats) lost.The Alliance, while a progressive government trying to spread such things as equal rights, healthcare, civilization, and enlightenment, is out of it's depth in the outer planets, they lack both the manpower and the understanding needed.  Like all governments it also has it's secrets.The movie gets all of this across very quickly and, in my opinion, clearly.It also introduces the rumor of Reavers, brutal feral like humans (again, there are no aliens in the movie) who some believe don't really exist and others believe that, while sophisticated enough to pilot and maintain space ships and capable of working together flawlessly, have degenerated to the point that they do not merely rape and murder but also eat people alive and use their skins as clothing.The movie manages to say all of this (well some of it is shown instead of said) seamlessly and in a non-contrived fashion in less than ten minutes.After you have all of that covered it moves on (again seamlessly) and you see one of the things lurking in the underbelly of the largely benevolent government.  Experiments are being done on an innocent girl and while the purpose is unclear you lean that they have made a psychic and a ""living weapon"" out of her.  The fact that there can be a psychic is probably the only thing that requires significant suspension of disbelief.  But since the movie doesn't force hyperspace, transporters, or any such thing on you it's a fair trade off.The girl is rescued by her brother and the movie continues finally moving into the present tense as a government operative reviews footage of the escape.The worry is that as a psychic who was shown off to important officials she has picked up classified information that not even the operative himself is cleared to know.  His job is to keep secrets, not know them.Where the girl, River, is, is on a ship that could actually be lived in, though a couple of people in the movie call it crap.  In my mind this was a refreshing change,  while I have no problem with the ships in most sci-fi I really can't imagine people actually calling them home, this one is different.  The ship is Serenity and its crew does jobs both legal and otherwise.That is really all you need to know by way of back story and I don't want to spoil anything, I should say again that the characters can not simply be laid out, they are neither stereotypical nor copied so I can't just say who they are or even who they are like, you have to see it.  If I were to try to write a short description of any one of them it would turn out longer than everything I have written so far, the amount that you can pick up from an expression lasting only a couple of frames is incredible.By now you probably already know if you're going to see it or not.  I hope you do, I really think everyone should get a chance to see something this good.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3CXWBVC1622ZM	"JustMe ""Kate"""	This is a response to a review that was posted on Jan-7-2006.[Accually, my rating is 0; January 7, 2006:This movie was so boring. I do have to agree with some of the other people who reviewed this movie, the beginning was good, but the rest was terrible. I watched the first hour and fifteen minutes, and then i shut it off because I was about to cry on how dumb this movie was. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because there are millions of better movies out there. My friend is in love with this movie, and she wants sequals made. LISTEN DIRECTORS: THIS MOVIE WAS A PIECE OF TRASH, AND IF FOR SOME LUDACRIS REASON U DID MAKE SEQUALS, THEY WOULD BE JUST AS BAD, IF NOT WORSE, THAN THIS ONE!. I would much rather stick my finger through my eye, and swirl my brain around than have to sit through the first hour of this movie. SKIP THIS MOVIE, EXTREMELY BORING!]My reply: Shut up. This was the single greatest movie of 2005, I would like to say of all time but I haven't seen enough movies to justify it and I'm still very loyal to High Noon. Go ahead with that finger swirl, maybe it'll uncover the part of your brain that affects your taste so that you'll be able to judge things better. If you don't have the capacity to appreciate quality work, that's your loss. I believe I speak for Browncoats everywhere when I say, to you and to other people with your opinions(I hope for the sake of all humanity that there are very few like you): Just keep your mouth shut for the next few years so that those of us who actually have good taste can put it to good use watching more and equally spectacular installments of the Fireflyverse that will hopefully be created and released soon. We can't all be slaves to the trash that keeps popping up and sweeping the true gems into the bin. Don't ruin it for the rest of us.That said, I want to caution anyone who read the review to which I am replying. Don't pay any attention to it, that person is nuts. This movie was awesome. I'm not going to go into too much detail because I could go on for hours and I don't think anyone would really want to read it, plus you shouldn't really believe every review you read because it's just some random person's opinion, but it was truly magnificent. I would recommend Serenity to anyone who enjoys action, science fiction, or any other kinds of movies that are out there. This movie was beautiful, the best I've seen in years; it was exciting, suspenseful, creative, inspiring, and there's a thousand other words that can be used to describe it but I'd never be able to write them all. My advice: watch this movie. Don't judge something based on the reviews of a few random pricks. How many movies have you seen that were wonderful but other people hated? How many have you seen that were praised but then you saw them and they sucked? Don't believe everything people tell you. See Serenity and decide for yourself whether you like it. People in this world need to learn how to think for themselves instead of listening to everyone else's opinions.	5.0	needs more stars	2006-01-11	2	1	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3FXHG0YCDXRHE	justoneopinion	My family had seen this movie at a cousin's house and have laughed about it ever since. Deciding that I needed to experience the ridiculousness that is &#34;Serenity&#34;, we rented it for the evening.  They were absolutely right. Mediocre sets, randomly odd camera angles, writing that seemed to come straight from a Jr. High boy's journal, and really, really, poor acting come together to make the cheesiest movie to hit the screen since &#34;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&#34;. Every sci fi  clich&eacute; ever written was thrown together along with an unending line of boring and overdramatic monologues to make a movie that brought me anything but serenity.  The lead character &#34;River&#34; (yes, the name should warn you) was a cross between a Minority Report precog and a high school drama queen loving to be the center to of attention but trying to act like she wasn't. I remember when the Avenger movie was in the works and we heard that Joss Whedon was going to direct.  My family was so disappointed.  Now I know why.  (We actually LOVED the Avenger movie - so either Joss learned his lessons or the great actors of the Avengers stepped in to help make that movie a success.)  If you just have to watch this movie, then enjoy the comedy of it as a sci fi spoof. You cannot take this one seriously. I can't explain the high ratings it seems to get - an &#34;Emperor's New Clothes&#34; effect, I think. Either that or it is Jr. High boys doing the ratings. In true Serenity fashion I could end this with a long overdramatic monologue that really makes little sense, but instead I'll just tell you - skip this cheddar and go straight to the Avengers.	1.0	"Say ""CHEESE!"""	2013-05-01	45	5	40

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A168KK21695QUF	Kadun	If you are a Firefly fan, you will certainly love Serenity, This movie has all the action and humor of the series and it serves as a great follow up to the (saldy) unfinished series. The story clears up some plot elements that are left unanswered in the TV chapters and it gives a better insight in some characters.As for the physical product, the packaging is nothing special, it's just the DVD with it's plastic case. The DVD comes with some extras like director's commentary and deleted scenes. Nothing you wouldn't expect. Still, this movie is fantastic and the only reason you wouldn't want to see it is if you haven't seen Firefly yet.	5.0	A must watch for Firefly fans	2013-03-29	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ALLJT7S5QOFFZ	kaduzy	"I was looking forward to this movie, but it's not nearly as good as the series.  It is predictible, the ""big shock"" at the end is underwhelming, and the fight scenes are so mediocre that even the fights on ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" seem Matrix-worthy in comparison. Overall I feel like the plot is structured in a way that makes it harder for people who'd never seen the show to get into the movie.  There's some snappy dialogue, but the final death in the movie was cruel and unnecessary and it made me pretty mad.  But to be fair, this was the one part that WASN'T predictable, and that's exactly how Whedon wanted it.  His commentary track is uncharacteristically boring; most of it is taken up by talk of camera lenses and other sleep-inducing technical details I could care less about, and the the rest of it is ""I love this shot, and this piece of music, and this actor and that actor"" on and on and on.  He's usually much more interesting on commentary so I don't know what happened there.There's also not much character development here, and what little we get is truncated due to the need to spur the plot towards its disappointing conclusion.  One would think that fans of the show would be let down by that, but I guess not.  The DVD extras are pretty dull in general and generally not worth the time it takes to watch them.That's all fairly negative, so why the three-star review?  Well, it's mostly out of loyalty to Joss Whedon.  I am a huge fan of his work, and my general motto is that ""Anything you can do, Joss Whedon can do better.""  I think he's done better things than ""Firefly"" and this movie, but I respect and admire his passion for this work.  This movie is proof that passion -- from Whedon, his cast and all the ""browncoat"" die hard fans -- can move mountains, or at least get movies made.  And I think that's great news.  I certainly hope that if nothing else, all the people who like ""Firefly"" who weren't Whedon fans before will jump on the bus and help make all his future projects more successful.  This one wasn't, and I think the bad news is that its lack of success may have a lot to do with the fact that this movie simply wasn't that great.  And that's really too bad because Joss Whedon is very capable of greatness.  But I'm not worried, because I'll be watching whatever he does, so when the greatness comes back, I'll be right there, waiting."	3.0	Disappointing	2006-01-30	22	6	16

This film is far, far better than I'd expected and a wonderful example of what scifi can be.  If George Lucas had an opportunity to see this before he made the Star Wars series, those movies might actually be watchable.  He might have seen what characterization, decent writing, compelling characters and heart and soul can do for a movie. There is more excitement and humanity in 20 minutes of Serenity than in any three of the bloated and annoying products of  Lucas's imagination.  Watch it and enjoy.	5.0	superb, for what it is	2006-01-25	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AC2TKKW985V4D	"Kara Carter ""Kara"""	When the Sci Fi Channel here in the United States started showing Firefly, the cancelled TV series that lasted one season, in preperation for the new film Serenity, I decided to watch. The movie looked interesting enough from the trailers, and I didn't want to miss anything due to not watching the show. Not only did I discover an amazing new show, I saw Serenity with my non-Firefly watching friend, and I enjoyed it- my beloved crew was back for what seemed like an extra long episode of Firefly. Best of all, my friend declared it awesome and was able to understand it without ever having to watch Firefly. How does Joss Whedon do that?Serenity is an amazing film. I could have understood it without watching any Firefly, and it's more than the general action science fiction film. Anyone who's seen the trailer can see plenty of firepower, but you'd have to see the movie to see there's much more to it. It's extremely well-acted, especially by Summer Glau as River Tam. River is a psychic, but this is no crystal ball and funky turban steryotype. River is, as her brother puts it, a mentally traumatized seventeen year old girl. She obviously, without her drug-induced condition, would be just like any other seventeen year old girl- messing around with her brother Simon and seeing movies instead of being the main character of them. She wouldn't be a fugitive on the crew of the Serenity, with smugglers, a mercenary, and ex-soldiers on the losing side of the war that shaped all the characters.River is obviously the most interesting, but everyone else brings their own dimension to the film- and it works. There's the captain, Mal, an ex-soldier, his first mate Zoe, the pilot Wash (also Zoe's husband), River and Simon, the fugitives from the government, Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, and Jayne, the mercenary. Mal is a Han Solo figure, Jayne is tough, and Kaylee is always happy- they work so well together. I doubt it would have worked without Firefly behind it (what's better than a whole year to develop your characters?), but here it does, and it's a rare blend.Any more about the plot I'd likely spoil, but Serenity is one of the best movies I've seen. It's a shame it didn't do as well as it could have, but it's still an amazing film that's definitely worth your time. So is Firefly, by the way...you'll want to see it after Serenity if you haven't already.	5.0	Shiny!	2005-12-23	10	10	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1E7RJFB1UD4EU	Karl LeDoux	Serenity is a brilliant movie.  I know a few people who saw it in the theater who loved it, but I was not fortunate enough to see it before it was gone.  I only recently became a fan of the show, and seeing the Firefly series before I saw the movie made it even more fun.  I believe it is enjoyable no matter what you know (or don't know) going into it, but getting to spend fourteen episodes learning about nine crew members each with brilliant history and dialog makes seeing them in a great film a wonderful experience.  This movie had all the infectious humor of the TV series along with the same great visual effects, solid narrative and brilliant dialog.  Do yourself a favor and buy Serenity and the TV show it was based on, Firefly.  I'm confident you will enjoy them as much as I have.	5.0	Perfect follow-up to the Best TV show ever made!	2006-03-02	3	3	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AIIR8E34EDKCQ	- Kasia S.	I have briefly heard of this movie a while ago but didn't really go out of my way to see it. For a while now my boyfriend who has watched and loved it was bugging me to watch this so much that I agreed simply to stop him pestering me. I won't say that for once he was right, because some of the stuff he likes I enjoy too but man what a great movie, I secretly feel like I owe him!Serenity is like Enter the Dragon entangled in Star Wars. I was blown away by the graphics, flying space ships which were my favorite part, great scheme going on and a likable characteristic crew of the Serenity star ship. The only thing is that you really have to pay attention at the begging but then you can sit back, grab a beer and enjoy the ride.The movie is basically about a girl named River who is a psychic. She gets away from a facility that contains many secrets and she is being chased by an assassin from the Government in order to wipe out all her memories and take the crew who saved her with him. As war wiped out peace and places to live people had to move to different planets, dealing with outsiders who were aggresive and evil, terrorizing them. This was almost a mystery story of who River was and what secrets about the government and the way the planets were populated she knew about.I must say how much I loved the music, it reminded me of some Electronic Irish jig at times but was really super, I need to get the soundtrack too I see.This movie was really full packed of adrenaline, mystery, evil assassin following the crew, crazed monster like outsiders who were like scary savaged beasts; eating their captured pray alive and a girl, River who was a psychic and a mini Bruce Lee fighting champion. Watching her fight was like being mesmerized by a dancer, it was simply stunning as it reminded me of Kill Bill. There were samurai swords, far away galaxies, love and hate, slim escapes and plenty of visuals that qualify this as a 5 star film.	5.0	This will blow you away!	2006-04-29	10	9	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3EKHNXS65MD2D	Katherine Schwanitz	"A bit of warning about the review below. In life this reviewer is a real straight shooter, I'm blunt and I'll tell it how it is from my point of view. Like it or not that's up to you. But if you want a fluffy review look elsewhere.I watched ""Firefly"" when it first premiered and didn't like it. I just didn't get it and went back to watching ""Angel"". I maybe watched one more episode before it got cancelled and then got ambushed by some of my friends that did get hooked while it aired.So i bought the DVD set and that's when I finally loved it.And I'll tell the initiated, those who look upon us Browncoats with disdain, not getting why we dress up in our ""Browncoats"" and use out of date slang and chinese swears, it's because when you've watched the whole dvd set you see the love that was put into the series.Most people in the film biz are in it for the cold hard cash. Everyone from the coffee fetcher and up.Very few are in it for the love of the craft. And to collect a cast and crew that fall in love with the story and their characters- even the chinese slang that was so easy to botch, it's reflected on the screen. And that's why we love Joss. Because he knows how to radiate it from the words on up to the music. It makes his star, Nathan Fillion nerdy in love with the music.With that said, this film isn't for everyone. It's science fiction folks. The reason movies like ""Star Wars"" do so well is because their made for the masses. Ol' bell curved masses.Am I being derogatory? Hell yes. Anyone who works retail begins to deeply dislike the rude frothing masses. So fine, I can understand that some of you aren't going to get this movie, aren't going to get why great authors like Orsen Scott Card will tap dance the theme because he loves it so much (ah, just kidding I don't know if he can tap dance. But if he could...).And now here's the part where I have to comment on why I feel the movie doesn't earn it's fifth star.This is actually Joss' first direction of a motion picture, which might suprise the folks out there, and there is a hell of a difference between directing television and a movie. With that said even the untrained eye could spot several first time out mistakes. Which I'm not going into because this is a review and not a disertation and dissection.Also the cut scenes- the ones that explain Inara's place in the story. Seriously 7-10 more minutes wasn't going to break the story! I really can find no fault when the iniatiated ask me about ""Mal's Girlfriend"". I really hope they'll be on the DVD.Another point of contention, when a crew memeber dies and only Mal and Zoe witness it, the audience is left shaken and then a little pissed that there's barely any time or emotion shed for the dead. ""Serenity"" goes too subtle for the iniatiated. You'd have to have watched the series to know that Zoe was career Military. That she is trained to bottle up her feelings. It isn't until the battle that some of us can pick up that she doesn't want to live anymore and that's when she's hurt badly. Again the movie asks for your full atention and that's something for the masses that can be hard to give.Other than what's stated above, that the movie was really everything that I wanted in ""Serenity"". It's just a good movie. It's not the best ever, but it's the best out this year. It's a credit to the Science Fiction community, however lukewarm they may be to us.Thank you for your time."	4.0	An objective Browncoat's notes... >Spoilers contained&lt;	2005-10-21	14	14	0

Goal all along was for the show to become a film and then resume as a series. How about an a new series on SciFi? Firefly would make a great 4th hour of programming on Sci-Fridays! I know my TiVo would love it.......If you are thinking about buying here on Amazon vs at your local retailer- Amazon has the best price I have seen and it is flat out sold out everywhere I have been- in widescreen anyways. Full screen is readily available but what self respecting fan wants that?Best film in this verse this winter on DVD. ENJOY	5.0	I WANT MORE!	2006-01-01	10	10	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ATOI54AD6WRRO	Kathryn M. Blackburn	"Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" is everything George Lucas got right in his original Star Wars trilogy, and everything that was missing from his latest three films.Whedon's strengths are his ability to create great characters (and make you care about them almost instantly), his terrific way with dialogue, his wit, and a penchant for moments of angst that just make you wanna cry.  All these talents and more are shown off wonderfully in ""Serenity.""  Other reviews here go into much greater detail, but simply put, this was not just the best sci-fi film of 2005 (miles better than ""Revenge of the Sith""), but one of the best among any genre, period."	5.0	The Best Movie of '05 You Didn't See	2005-12-12	16	15	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q4BLB1K3BVDJ	Kayta Mae	Serenity is a sort of continuation, or perhaps finale, of the tv series Firefly, featuring the same crew characters who got to know each other while living in space together on a ship who's name gives us our title.  However, while Firefly focused more on captain Malcom Reynolds as the main character and the entire crew's interactions during various adventures, Serenity focuses more on the fugitive River Tam, explaining exactly why the government wants her back so badly.  The movie provides some closure to the series, with both happy and sad moments, but also gives details you were never able to find in Firefly.  The movie has less comedic aspects overall than the series, but that does not make it any less enjoyable.Despite being in direct connection with the Firefly series, Serenity can still be enjoyed without having previously viewed any Firefly episodes.  It is a great SciFi movie with an interesting plot and a good amount of action.	4.0	Great addition to a great series	2009-04-27	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AHQBXGFFMBBC9	kazper	I'll be honest, when Firefly came out I had no clue what it was. It wasn't until almost a decade later that I found the series on Netflix and started watching it. From then, I was hooked by the great case and original plot lines.After going through the series twice, I decided it was finally time to watch the &#34;finale&#34; of Serenity. My biggest fear was that it wouldn't live up to the hype of the series. Luckily, that was a non-issue. My only other concern was that there would be no new adventures with the crew of the Serenity after watching the movie. Still, I pressed on and watched the end of this epic saga.The movie itself does a much better job of outlining the characters than the first few episodes of the show ever did. Granted there was a reason for this, but if this movie led the way to the series, I think there would have been a larger following.Serenity picks up a while after Firefly left off. Not all of the crew are still aboard the ship, as the Shepherd has moved onto a planetary colony elsewhere and Inara is tending to one of her &#34;clients&#34;. The movie mostly deals with the crew trying to free Summer from the chase of the Alliance. In order to do this, they have to battle countless foes including the mysterious reevers. The movie provides details that would have been covered if the show had not have been cancelled so quickly, such as why the Alliance is after Summer. Truth be told, it is very obvious why any organization would want her &#34;talents&#34; after seeing her abilities in action.I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars because there were some parts that I wasn't impressed with. Wash's death really sticks out in my mind. Not that killing his character was wrong, but how they did it seemed tragic. He could have died protecting Zoe, sacrificing himself to make sure she managed to escape an impossible situation or gone down with his ship while everyone else escaped (Titanic-esque, I suppose).Still, this was a great movie that I will probably watch at least once or twice more. I'm sad to see the cast and crew leave their roles, but I'm glad they were given one last chance to tie things up at least a little bit.	4.0	So long, Serenity...	2013-11-22	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3H3V7WBL8OLZO	K. Ball	I saw Serenity without ever having seen an episode of Firefly. So I think its fair to say that my opinion is not biased by already being a fangirl. I found the movie incredible! I had no idea what to expect, but immediately fell in love with the world Joss created.The characters have substance, which is something seriously lacking in a lot of films today. I cared about them immediately, I felt their pain and rejoiced in their triumphs. My love of this movie then sparked my interest in Firefly. So I watched the series and of course loved it.I then rewatched Serenity and found it to be even better now that I knew more about the characters.So I'm hear to say that you dont already have to be a fan of Firefly to enjoy this movie. Although personally, I think you just might want to check it out after you have seen it. This is definitely a movie that deserved more attention than it got.	5.0	Someone who did NOT see Firefly first	2005-12-13	18	18	0

The movie is ten times better when watched in proper order.This is my fourth purchase of SERENTIY, and I rarely double-dip, let alone purchase the same movie SEVERAL times.  Two DVD releases and an HD DVD precede my ownership of the Blu-Ray.The HD DVD video transfer is pretty grand, with few complaints.  This Blu Ray is ported directly over, as far as I can tell.  The real winner with the Blu Ray is the DTS-HD lossless audio.  SERENITY has never sounded better!  If there's one thing I'm happy about Blu-Ray taking the leading crown over HD DVD is the extra memory space to allow such astounding audio!If you have previous versions, this is worth the upgrade if you have the audio set up to exploit it.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2DB720I9XRX7K	K. Draper	"""Serenity"" is the name of the space vessel in this space-western movie.  The name seems to be based on the valley Serenity where Captain Mal and his first mate Zoe were the lone survivors in a battle against the Alliance. They were part of the resistance, but after they--The Brown Coats--lost the war, Mal still resisted assimilation and aquired a ""Firefly class"" cargo space ship, and. along with his assorted crew of nine, basically continued to operate on the fringes of society. Their adventures are the subject of the TV series ""Firefly"".  Among the ship's crew is a talented young doctor, Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his rather mysterious younger sister, River (Summer Glau). As it turns out, River, though she has been highly traumatized by the Alliance through special ""schooling"" they had her in, has some extrodinary gifts, including being a psychic and having astonishing fighting skills. Simon had risked his life and gave up a prestigious career to rescue her from the Alliance and they are hell-bent on getting her back. The action of the movie centers around the Alliance, in the person of a nameless yet fearsome operative nicely played by Chiwetel Ejiofer, hunting down Serenity in order to recapture or kill the young prodigy. Captian Mal and crew are really not aware of who she is or the risk they are under, yet they end up actually having similar goals in resisting the domination of the Alliance and exposing the truth about them, at least insofar as planet Miranda and the identity of the Reavers, a bestial and violent human-variant.As I said, the movie does have quite a lot of action. Like the TV series, it sometimes seems like a cowboy shoot 'em up show, only in outer space. The characters have a peculiar way of speaking--they use ""ain't"", and the leave the gs off of the end of verbs, which makes them seem ""country"", but they also sometimes mutter phrases in Chinese or use words like ""gorom"" or ""verse"".  Zoe (Gina Torres) is tough as nails, and she uses a sawed-off shotgun. Jewel Strait as Kaylee, is a chipper young girl who is also a mechanical genius who keeps the scarred and embattled Serenity running. Other characters are equally colorful. The story worked pretty well. I like how they showed flash-backs to River's childhood in school where she didn't just accept everything she was being taught, and also at the end where we learned more about the Reavers and how they came about.

It is one of the few movies that left me wondering how it would end.What you need to accept to enjoy:Guns with bullets are more reliable and cheaper for the common folk than laser guns.People living off the land in the future will not be wearing shiny silver cloths.People in the future will be good and evil, kind and cruel, greedy and giving.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A80DBAPFGBL1C	"Keegan S. Clements-housser ""Keegan C-H"""	Let me start off by saying that I actually found the film to be rather mediocre, and not at all the kind of send-off that such an incredible series deserved. In this light, you might start to wonder why I gave it 5 Stars.The answer? It deserves as much notice as it can possibly receive.You see, if you're like me, you'll watch this film with no prior knowledge, be less than impressed with it, and then leave it alone for a couple years - until hearing all the unrelenting praise for Firefly, the show that spawned this movie, finally gets you to watch it. Then you become a fan, this movie remains somewhat mediocre (although with some effort you can delude yourself into thinking it's excellent), and you find yourself desperately wishing that the series would go on. Then you promptly go buy the full series and this movie, and hope against hope itself that someone will decide to pick the show up again on account of its sheer popularity (and the creator will actually deem it worth his time once more, as well as the original actors), and let the Serenity fly on.With any luck, by my giving this 5 Stars, you'll follow my example, give it a try, and eventually find yourself adding your support to the continuation of the series. With even more luck, you'll read this review and skip straight to watching the show, and lend the movement your support much sooner.	5.0	The film itself isn't great, but the show is the stuff of legends	2010-09-11	4	1	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZGAZLH9K711I	Keonyn	A great release of a great movie. This set probably should have been available from the very beginning, but better late than never I suppose.The movie itself is a great sci-fi ride that isn't reliant on exploding ships and is more dependent on an actual story with depth. Of course, that's not to say there's no action as there is plenty of that as well. This is the perfect blend of great sci-fi storytelling, genre diversity and action in a single feature film.While the movie is based off the Firefly TV series, the director and writing staff did a great job in making it easily accessible to those who have not seen the series. It's rare that a film so anticipated by its fanbase actually lives up to their expectations; but I would argue Serenity easily surpassed mine.My one gripe is that this version has DTS sound, where as the previous version did not. While DTS is normally a good thing, I must admit I didn't notice too great a difference between the DTS and Dolby Digital tracks. The sound is great regardless, but I was just hoping to be blown away by the difference like when you compare a film like Master and Commanders DTS to its Dolby track.The special features are definitely worth picking up this volume for. The behind the scenes features and interviews are great and do not get boring. The Sci-Fi Inside feature does repeat some elements seen in other special features, but it also provides plenty of material not seen in the other features to make it worth watching.All in all this is a great, if not late, release of a highly underrated film. I know many are probably saying that the sci-fi fanbase rates it very highly, but I believe that it easily deserves praise from the mainstream as well. It's a great movie, based on a great series, that everyone should give a chance whether they're sci-fi buffs or not.	5.0	5 Stars and easily worth every one and then some	2008-02-24	3	2	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2AZKOCXE7SKW6	Kevin J	"In 2002, Joss Whedon, the creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' brought to television a new series called 'Firefly.' Despite being loved by the fans, it was unjustly tried and convicted by studio execs and killed off after only airing 11 episodes. 'Serenity' is the major motion picture from the 'Firefly' 'Verse...The film starts off with some background on the characters of Simon and River Tam, and how Simon frees her from an Alliance ""school"" where she has been subjected to numerous horrific tests. We also are introduced to the main Villain of the film, ""The Operative."" His job is to find the Tam's and bring them back.We then cut to the ship ""Serenity"" as she is flying through space towards a planet where it's crew - lead by Captain ""Mal"" Reynolds, has a job waiting for them. Captain Reynolds and his crew are - for lack of a better term - people for hire. You need something done/stolen/etc., you call on the crew of ""Serenity."" We also learn that two of the ""crew"" of ""Serenity"" - Shepherd Book and Inara Serra - have left the ship in the intervening months (this film supposedly takes place 6 months after the ""Firefly"" episode ""Objects in Space"").Suffice it to say that things go wrong, and this leads directly into the peril that the crew will face from the ""Operative"" and his masters, the ""Alliance."" Captain Reynolds and his crew have several tasks to undertake: keep one step ahead of the enemy; find out what secret is driving River Tam insane, and protecting themselves against other evils, not only in the blackness of space, but the evil that man can do to his fellow human beings.This all comes together in an enormous space battle between the Alliance and a group of mutants called ""Reavers."" It seems like nearly every science-fiction movie has to have a space battle, but this one was very smartly thought out.The music was composed by David Newman, and he did a magnificent job. He had action cues where needed, suspenseful cues when called for, and basically hit every note right in scoring this film. It definitely added to the story, as most excellent film scores are designed to do.There is almost everything in this film that any fan of Firefly, or any fan of science fiction, can appreciate. It has suspense, warmth, action, adventure, terror, and all of it rolled up into a two-hour movie. This is a film that actually was intelligently shot and produced, not like many films that come out of Hollywood today, where you can check your brain at the door because of the films' simplistic and stupid pandering to the masses. ""Serenity"" stands above all that: it brings you into the story, does its level best to get you emotionally attached to the characters, so you feel what they feel, and care about them. That is the function of a well-written film: to get you involved with the characters.Hopefully this is not the end of Captain Reynolds and the crew of ""Serenity"" on the big screen (or small screen). A film (or television show) like this comes only once in a great while, and it deserves every accolade it can garner. Fans of the TV show and non-fans alike will be able to enjoy this film. The fans because they can re-connect with their favorite characters and the non-fans can enjoy a great science-fiction film.It's too bad that Universal Home Video doesn't include trailers on their DVDs anymore. Also, they could have waited to put this out, and made it a real good release. But they usually double-dip, so there will be a ""special edition"" within months."	3.0	Serenity Flies High - Dvd kind of	2005-11-01	37	15	22

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2	"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore"""	This movie proves my claim that part of what makes Firefly a classic TV series is that it's incomplete.  In an attempt to turn a brilliant-but-cancelled TV show into a film franchise, the creators try to tie up too many loose ends, lose track of the radiant energy that makes the show a DVD mainstay, and don't even shoot the finished product in a visually appealing manner.To start with, the movie gives us an opening sequence that flatly contradicts some of the facts revealed in the series pilot.  To its credit, this sequence also gives us Chiwetel Ejiofor, an inspired young British actor who adds a strong note to this story.  But the confusion brought about by this opening teaser presages the confusion committed fans will likely feel throughout the film.Then the main body of the story starts several months after the end of the series.  Inarra and Book have left the crew of Serenity, and River has crossed a line, getting her and her brother evicted.  If this feels like the kind of crew-splitting that caused the first Star Trek movie to have such a confoundingly long opening act, well, that's an apt analogy.The film then sets out to close down several of the series' unresolved storylines, not by actually closing them, but by creating new storylines that have nothing to do with the series.  Couple that with River's newfound superhero powers, and a visual design so murky that the entire movie seems shot through Beijing smog, and you have a film that frustrates rather than satisfies fans.I really, really love Firefly.  Though only fourteen episodes were shot, it's so full of promise and energy that fans of smart stories can't help but be drawn in.  That very promise, unsullied by the need for pat answers, has made the unfinished series a classic.  This effort at just those pat answers, well, sullies the series.  Enjoy your Firefly DVDs, but give this film a miss.	2.0	Burn the Land and Boil the Sea	2009-11-10	22	9	13

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3MFJE2VCPA8KO	kfizzle33	For those of you who are not aware, Serenity is a film that serves as the conclusion to Joss Whedon's sci-fi television series, Firefly. Firefly was a phenomenal show that ended well before its time. Patrons of show, like myself, were left wanting more after watching the 14th and final episode. Serenity was the answer to those prayers. Whedon tied off many of the loose ends with the film that were left open after the conclusion of Firefly. However, Serenity is also a great stand-alone movie as well. Whedon had enough foresight to add plenty exposition for viewers who were not familiar with the television series, giving them just as much of a chance to enjoy the film. The CGI was also stepped up from the series, making the action sequences that much more entertaining. Serenity is an amazing film that I would recommend to anyone looking for an excellent way to spend a couple hours. My one and only gripe however is plot related so *SPOILER ALERT*, the captain STILL doesn't get together with Anara. Seriously Whedon, Simon and Kaylee finally but not Mal and Anara?!?! The biggest loose end remains untied...FOREVER.	5.0	A Near Perfect End to the Perfect Show	2010-08-10	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2PQA5JWUNBDK0	K. Flagg	I'm glad I bought Firefly & Serenity.  I had never seen the show when it was on network TV so all I had to go on were the reviews.  I can see why the show didn't make it which is a shame because as we see with Serenity & beyond it would have been worth it to give it a real chance.  Serenity isn't a great movie but it is so very sweet of JW to send this sort of DVD love letter to the fans (even down to the last speech about love) who are still preaching the word of Firefly (and generating cash) even tho' the show was canceled 5 years ago.  Rarely do you see something done on this scale just for the fans (this movie doesn't hold much water without knowing in the series) and it's why I gave Serenity the extra star.  It was a fitting farewell.	4.0	It's all Shiny....Love Josh	2010-05-17	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"I'm sure you got a lot more out of ""Serenity"" if you followed the television series it is a part of.  To be honest, it was a tad confusing to figure out just who was who in this film since I've never watched the show.  I played catch-up for most of the film.  The basic plot is simple enough:  the ""Alliance"" is after the young girl named ""River.""  We don't find out until later in the film exactly why they are after.  That's a good thing, but I felt as if the girl and her brother had only recently joined the crew of the ""Serenity.""  From watching the documentaries on the DVD, I gathered that they've been a part of the crew for some time.The acting is very good in this flick.  Adam Baldwin is great as ""Jayne.""  I've always felt that deep inside that guy is a superstar waiting to crawl out.  Instead, he's left to play second fiddle or be a minor character in the bulk of the movies he's been in.  It's nice to finally see him get a little more spotlight in this movie.  Nathan Fillion plays ""Mal,"" the captain of the outlaw crew.  The crew is fleshed out with solid acting from Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau and the beautiful Jewel Staite.  Chiwetel Ejiofor is the figurehead for the ""Alliance"" in the film, and he ends up being a rather good character in the film.  Other characters included the humorous ""Mr. Universe"" and ""Shepherd,"" a sort of ""Gandalf"" of the galaxy kind.The special effects were very good considering this flick had a rather thin budget to work with compared to other films in the sci-fi genre.  The majority of the digitally animated sequences blended quite nicely with the live-action in the movie.  Also, the effects do not hinder the action, which is often throughout, in the film.The banter between characters was nice to see on the screen.  All of them had witty exchanges that made me laugh, much like writer and director, Joss Whedon's other TV hits, ""Buffy"" and ""Angel.""Speaking of Whedon, watching him in the documentaries gave me the feeling that this dude is a little bit too much into himself.  Sure, he wrote ""Angel,"" ""Buffy,"" and ""Firefly,"" but all of those flicks have cult appeal.  There's nothing wrong with that, but there are other writers out there who've done the same thing Whedon has done but have managed to reach massive groups of people.  For instance, the original ""Star Wars"" flicks reached a lot of non-sci-fi fans.  Of course, George Lucas has fallen prey to vanity, but he's made a few more pennies at this craft than Whedon.  The ""Star Trek"" franchise has both a cult AND non-sci-fi following.  In short, I'm not knocking Whedon for what he has done, I just think his ego is a bit too big for his current status.  Ask Joe Public who George Lucas is, and they'll know.  Ask them the same thing about Whedon and you'll probably get a puzzled look in return.For fans of the TV series, I'm sure that ""Serenity"" is a dream-come-true, but for general film fans, this movie's a bit middle-of-the-road.  If you enjoy any series cranked out by SciFi channel, this film is for you.  If you watch SciFi for their hokey creature features, just flip on the TV on Saturday or Sunday.For fans:  purchase.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1DYPDLWG0L1B4	"Kirk ""Kirk"""	"Serenity is a glorified Battlefield Earth. Whedon is the L. Ron Hubbard to the more zealous browncoat's church of Scientology. Ironically, for all the browncoat bashing of Lucas, Gene Roddenberry, and the fans of other genre franchises-their leader, Whedon, wants to be the very people his followers viciously insult and attack.Whedon doesn't want to be Kurosawa, or Cronenberg, or Kubrick, because none of the truly gifted film makers have achieved the pop culture icon status that the Spielberg and Lucases of the world have. Whedon wants to be the star, the icon, the visionary. He's just as self-important and pretentious as Chris Carter. He's similar to Steven Sommers, the writer/director of the craptastic ""Mummy remakes"". Writers and directors who grew up during this era of film tend to lack originality and geniune artistic vision, which is why they are constantly ripping off Spielberg and Lucas.Which is, needless to say, also ironic since Spielberg and Lucas were also ripping off the truly great directors and writers in film history-the difference is, of course, Lucas and Spielberg freely admit when they borrowed or stole-and for all theirfaults, (and they have many) Spielberg and Lucas have talent and vision-even if it has become muddled by technology and the 'yes' men they surround themselves with.Perhaps I am bias. Perhaps I'm giving Lucas more credit than he deserves. But I'd rather sit through the crappiest moments of the Phantom Menace than watch the best moments of Serenity or Firefly. I mean, at least Lucas don't pretend its highart."	1.0	Browncoats in bed with film's publicist	2005-10-17	134	13	121

It seems many people can't handle that combination in a movie - they find mindless tripe to be more their speed.The level of sassy, blunt, crass dialog was just fantastic. The plot was strong, and the execution was done well. Joss Whedon's directorial path was masterful, and the actors brought their roles to life. You do not have to have seen Firefly (the show that this movie was based on) to like the movie - at the showing last night, a half-dozen of my fellow moviegoers who had never seen it swore that they loved the movie and wanted to borrow my DVD's of the show!I loved Serenity. I have seen it three times, and I will go to see it again when it opens on Friday. The movie isn't *quite* a 10/10, unless you are a Browncoat at heart, and love and respect the characters. To the general public, this movie will probably garner one of two reactions, as most Joss Whedon productions do:Either you hate it, or you love it. There's usually no middle ground.Give Serenity a try. See where you fall.	5.0	A Love/Hate Relationship?	2005-10-01	18	17	1

I am a huge fan of Star Trek - particularly Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation.  I watched, Star Trek: Enterprise and Battlestar Galactica (the new one) and was very disappointed with both.  I attempted to watch Babylon 5 and Farscape, but was very bored with the characters.  That being said, the Firefly series and the movie Serenity are excellent and represents some of the best science fiction of the 21st century.It is important to note that this movie is based off of the firefly series, and, while an excellent movie on its own right, is best to watch the series first.  The movie does have complete plot and seeing firefly is not required to enjoy and understand the movie.  However, watching the series first will give a greater appreciation for the characters, 'verse, setting, and plot subtleties, making the movie more impactful and enjoyable.  As of writing this review, it has been 1 week since I finished watching Firefly and Serenity.  During this week I have thought back to the show and 'verse many times and imaged my own adventures.As it stands both the show and movie are excellent and thoroughly entertaining.

She was pretty irked that there was only one season and one movie for us to watch. If she likes it, so will you.A note about order: Serenity should be watched after you've watched the series, as there are some game-changers here.

But, as per usual, Whedon's work functions on many levels, and this is no shallow action movie.  There is:- character development (due to time constraints it's limited to 2 of the main characters - Mal and River);- a plot that's far superior to many in this field;- a message via an ethical/political issue to ponder;- an interesting villain;- and smoothly blended in humor/drama/romance.Add to this wonderful writing, amazing acting, and great special effects (especially for the tight budget they were working with).  Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau shine in portraying both torment and triumph (I focus on them because the film does - 'Firefly' shows that the entire cast is talented).

He showed that first in Buffy and Angel, and though I haven't watched Firefly, Serenity is truly spectacular.  As someone who did not even know about the show until after it had been canceled, I went to see this movie because Joss had written and directed it.  I was not familiar with the series, but I knew that if Joss had written it, then it was worth trying out.I'm glad I did.  I loved it.  And it has allowed me to take interest in a series I may not have given a chance otherwise.  The movie is written so that if you are not familiar with the series then you'll still be able to understand and enjoy it.

Firefly/Serenity is a must see for all Sci Fi fans.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2W7M94XJDHF6V	KroolShooz	I watched this movie several years ago having never seen its progenitor, the Firefly series. At the time I probably would have rated it a 3. The movie was decent enough, but I could tell I was missing a lot of backstory and therefore I found it hard to become involved. It was clear that I was supposed to care deeply about characters that the movie alone hadn't really made me care about. To be honest, it didn't hold my attention much.A couple months back I found that the series was on Amazon Prime. I watched it and then rewatched the movie, and whaddaya know, with the character backstories in place the movie was gripping and emotionally charged. I'm not the first reviewer to say this, but if you're going to watch Serenity you are really doing yourself a disservice by not watching the Firefly series first.I rate the movie lower than five because I really don't think it stands on its own very well, but greater than three because it is an excellent capstone to the saga.	4.0	Good movie but watch series first	2012-10-09	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AVMZJ18CAGBZ8	Krystal Potter	"I've been a Star Trek fan all of my life. I had never heard of the Firefly series due to an almost non-existent promotional campaign. A friend of mine in Australia bought the series for me. He told me in detail what happened with the show. I was skeptical when I first watched it. There is really very little GOOD sci-fi out there.By the end of the short series, I was in tears. I have never cried over a television show. The pulling of this show has to be one of the biggest blunders in network history ! It would have outdone and outlasted Star Trek. The realism and the humor are brilliant. The cast could not have been more perfect.My friend consoled me with the fact there was a movie ""Serenity"" soon to be released on DVD. The promotion for the movie was so lacking I never even knew it was in the theatres. I'd never heard of it. I purchased the DVD as soon as it came out.They had a very small budget to work with in making this movie. What they did with that budget is nothing short of miraculous. It is so very rare when every part of a movie is good. The story, plot, characters, actors, and special effects are all simply amazing.I heard today that the movie is now ""out of the red"" and making money through DVD sales. I have purchased the Firefly series for friends and will do the same with Serenity. The more people know about it, the more will get hooked and perhaps our influence can sway Universal to do another movie before the cast is old and grey. I heard NBC bought the rights to a 3 movie deal. That would be smart if they actually do it. It would be smarter yet to re-instate the original Firefly series. If they really want to show their IQ's, they will advertise it WELL. Firefly/Serenity beats Star Trek hands down, my condolences to Gene Roddenbury, but this is better. Never thought I'd say that. The big companies have a cult hit on their hands that could make them money for the next 40 years if they play it right. How they have handled it so far is a travesty.Buy Serenity ! Buy Firefly ! Send the only message the networks and movie companies understand...money. This show is worth it. You will not be disappointed ! Let's show them we want Firefly/Serenity back in any format ! If you are digusted with the poor entertainment on television and at the theatre, you need to speak out.

In the days of remakes and stupid movies it was nice to find an intelligent but down to earth movie. This one actually seemed to have been written by someone who knew how to write. I'm so sick of 80's remakes of what were already bad movies or series. They just seem to have run out of ideas haven't they? This one was fun and original. I have a soft spot for westerns as they're the real action movies I grew up with. This movie had great dialogue and good and sometimes strong acting. Considering the budget (I read somewhere it wss made quick and underfunded) I was pretty impressed with the finished product. Can't imagine what they would have done if they'd had a big budget.

The story line is excellent, the cast is outstanding, the special effects are perfectly ""simple"", and the plot wasn't predictable.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AX73RR9ZKNAM8	Kurt Jungck	I had already previously owned a copy of this movie, this was a replacement for an old worn out home recorded copy.Amazon went above and beyond with customer satisfaction.  My order placed with regular mail shipping got hung up in Philadelphia for several days, missing the orignal delivery date.  When I used the 'where is my order?' inquiry, to perhaps get a revised delivery date, I expected some song and dance about delivery dates being approximate only etc, but my reply from Amazon blew me away.  Email from service apologized for missing the delivery date, and informed me that they were shipping a copy, overnight UPS, at no extra charge, and if my original order showed up to just refuse and return.  I got my movie, which is one of my favorites, and eventually did get the original USPO mailed order, which I returned as instructed.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A32W6O80V2Y4QW	kuvasza	"Serenity is a great film.  It's fun, it's fast-paced, it has memorable dialogue (""I don't want to explode!"").  It balances drama and fast-paced action with dialogue that had the audience bursting out with laughter when I saw it last night in the theater.Serenity is, for all intents and purposes, Firefly's last episode + the passage of a few months' time off-screen.  Firefly was a short-lived series on the Fox channel.  It lasted all of eleven or so episodes and the Fox exec's did what they usually did: they saw it was quality television with brilliant dialogue, an amazing ensemble of talented actors, character development, and -- worst of all -- a story arc that actually was going somewhere ... and they killed it.  Serenity is the product of fan loyalty and a tireless director's efforts and -- most importantly -- millions of the series DVD's flying of the shelves.  It's the child of people loaning their Firefly DVD""s to their friends and their friends watching four episodes, returning the set, and then going out to buy their own DVD set, because it was an amazing series.  The movie is every bit as good, which is pretty damned gratifying.It's been written so that it isn't at all necessary to have seen the short-lived series to 'get' the film.  Seeing the film, however, will leave you wanting to get the series on DVD.  Serenity is everything the fans loved about the series: atmosphere, character, story development.  And Whedon, as always, is merciless.  Hollywood franchises typically build and preserve their assets: characters are eternal, there is no real story development, episode 48 is for all intents and purposes the same as episode 2.  Whedon is exactly the opposite : if a character millions of fans love needs to die in a scene, Whedon kills him, her, it, their pet goldfish and drops a ship on them just to make it absolutely clear that they are dead, gone, finis, pushing up daisies in that grand daisy-pushing place where Firefly characters go when they die.  Whedon tells stories.  It's part of what makes this an amazing two-hour, multi-million dollar, seat-of-your-pants, ""that was amazing!"" event.  This movies goes places and when it's done you're a: satisfied, and b: you make plans to take your friends to it and c: you want to see a Big Damn Trilogy.I won't give away anything in the film, but I recommend this film.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2H8ZJRU31MIMN	K. Wanner	Serenity is the climactic, epic ending to the Firefly series. Basically, they tie up all the loose ends that were left open when the show ended. The movie itself is awesome- witty, funny, immersive, clever- but this special collector's edition is a treat in itself. The box itself is unlike any dvd case I've ever seen- you can't get a good feel for it just by looking at the preview picture. It's got some neat features that weren't released on the normal Dvd version, so it's worth checking out!This is a great movie even if you haven't seen Firefly; being familiar with the show only helps make some events and characters more meaningful.

Don't get me wrong, the movie stands on its own, but has a much more emotional impact if you're familiar with the series. Firefly is arguable one of the greatest series ever, and now Serenity takes its place as one of the finest films ever made in my opinion (and Joss didn't need 150 million to do it). Once you become familiar with these characters and the 'verse they live in, they will become like family.	5.0	If god existed, his name would be Joss Whedon	2005-12-23	13	6	7

I bought this, despite owning the original release of the film on dvd, hoping for some spectacular extras.  That is NOT the case, sadly.  There are four additional items, and I haven't found a single easter egg.  The extras are nice, but why didn't they add the extras from the Australian edition, or all the stuff that they said they had to cut in addition to the cuts shown?  Yes, I'll buy the 'super-dragon-tiger edition' should it come out eventually, but for what is advertised as a great collectors edition, I was disappointed.

It wraps up the gaps left open and gives closure.This is a great fit for someone who likes westerns as this has a cowboy feel to it. It's also a great fit to the true science fiction lovers. There are moments reminiscent of Han Solo hollering for Chewbacca to bring him tools while he's trying desperately trying to fix the Millennium Falcon. The scenery has a hint of Dune due to the desert setting only. There is a moment near the end with a surprise as big as Darth Vader's, &#34;Luke...I am your father.&#34;If you're looking for something a little different and a lot of fun, this is your collection to buy.	5.0	A Kicking Closer to an Overlooked Gem of a Sci-Fi Original	2012-12-27	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2IO1ESNSIAXG3	L. A. Kane	"I rarely find a movie I want to watch more than once, owning only 18 DVDs. This is one of those select few. It is not only a fantastic show in its own right, but it makes a highly satisfying wrap-up to the short-lived Firefly series. The entire original cast made the transformation from small to large screen and their chemistry has only gotten better over time. We find out the secrets of River's past, meet the dreaded Reavers, and uncover their mysterious history as well. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays one of the best ""bad guys"" ever filmed, an Alliance operative who's not truly evil, just overly dedicated and willing to do anything for his cause. The special effects truly complement the story line yet don't steal the show as they do in many sci-fi productions. Everything from the costumes, sets, props, and effects blend together seamlessly to make this future verse believable.The only shortcoming is the bonus material, which is far to short and adds little to the viewing experience. The deleted scenes don't add a lot to the story line, though the outtakes are funny. Re-igniting the Firefly is the best segment of the extra stuff. Be that as it may, the movie is well written, brilliantly acted, and thoroughly enjoyable. I saw Serenity in the theatre and then found out about the Firefly TV series, which I subsequently purchased for myself. I bought the movie as soon as it became available and have watched it several times since. I truly hope they make a sequal.Highly recommended!"	5.0	Out-freaking-standing!!	2006-01-02	9	8	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ASX56JKI4EDQY	lark	"I loved the series and I loved this movie. I won't go into plot points here b/c so many others have. When I heard about the movie being a reality I was excited, but grew very worried when I saw the uninspiring trailers (all, what, two of them - sheesh). When I saw the movie the first time on opening night, I was stunned and thrilled. It exceeded my expectations, both as a fan and a movie-goer.I ended up seeing the movie an embarrassing number of times in the theatre. The only time I did not thoroughly enjoy it was when some inconsiderate fan kept talking (so going to the Special Hell). It isn't perfect (what is?), it definitely takes more than one viewing to catch everything, it isn't for folk who slip into a coma if something isn't exploding every five minutes, it isn't for folk who need to be hit over the head with CGI, and someone familiar with the series would probably get more out of it (but hey, they sell that here too!). Qualifiers aside, it was the most entertained I remember being in a theatre - maybe ever.A lot of the other reviews have covered the good points of the film. I just want to re-iterate one: the main strength of this film is the characters. As an avid reader of everything from comic books to literature, I can state without hesitation that I believe Malcolm Reynolds is one of the best fictional characters ever created. I can't imagine anyone but Nathan Fillion playing him, b/c he does it so well. I would also like to address the few people who claim the movie was predictable. I had seen every episode in the series, most more than once, prior to seeing the movie and I was surprised by every plot twist. It is inconceivable to me that anyone could honestly call this movie predictable.If you have never seen Firefly or Serenity, remember that popularity and commercial success are not necessarily measures of quality nor can they predict how you personally will react to a movie. Nothing pleases all, but most of the folk who saw this movie enjoyed it (even newbies). It got an 80% (subject to change) on the Tomatometer (87% from the Cream of the Crop critics) and was Certified Fresh with over one hundred reviews. Last I checked, it had a B+ (users) on Yahoo movies with over 17,000 reviews. The series has been an Amazon top seller for a ridiculously long time. Not bad for a tv show/movie about ""cowboys in space speaking Chinese"" with no big-name stars. It's weird, it works, and it's wonderful. Those who can't get it don't, but those who do fall in love for life.All praise aside, when I get this DVD, I will be pulling out the abominable, misleading cover art, shredding it, and generating my own insert with my trusty PC.

I bought the DVD of Serenity when it came out, and then upgraded to this disc when it came out.  There is nothing changed in the movie.  There are no added scenes, and this is not a directors cut of the movie or anything.  However, you do get a whole second disc with added features, which include interviews, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and a new commentary track that allows even more insight into the film and the series.I love the show, and I LOVE this movie, so I am a bit biased.  I would say if you don't already own the movie, buy this great set for the added features and packaging.  If you own the DVD, only upgrade if you are geeky enough (like me) to really enjoy the few but quality special features.

I never got into the series on TV because I never heard about it but my brother told me to watch this movie and I am hooked.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"If you were thinking that Joss Whedon wrote and directed ""Serenity"" to be the first in a series of movies based on the crew of his late and lamented television series ""Firefly,"" think again. Whedon knows this might be his only bite of the cinematic apple for his creations, so fans will see this being more like the series finales of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel."" In other words, not everybody is going to be around for the final credits.To get everybody on the same page Whedon begins with Simon (Sean Maher) breaking his sister River (Summer Glau) out of the Alliance laboratory where they are busy playing with her brain. River is both a psychic and a living weapon, and it turns out that it is the former that is of the biggest concern to the Alliance because she knows something she should not know. That knowledge, rattling around in her head, is part of the reason that River is mentally unstable, and so the Alliance has sent an Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who has neither a name nor an official position, to bring her back. Then we jump to Serenity and a tracking shot in which the boat's captain, Mal (Nathan Fillion) starts in the cock pit with Wash (Alan Tudyk), and then walks all the way through the crew deck and returns back through the cargo deck, meeting Zoe (Gina Torres), Jayne (Adam Baldwin), and Kaylee (Jewel Statie), along with Simon and River along the way. Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) are no longer aboard, but rest assured they will pop up. So, Mal has River and the Alliance wants her, so the Operative is coming to get her and he is coming ""sideways.""Mal Reynolds is in the reluctant hero Han Solo/Rick Blaine mold; he and Zoe fought against the Alliance in the war and now his entire world is Serenity. His crew is his top priority and the Alliance is making a big mistake in forcing him to care about larger issues. Besides, he has an ace, or at least a wild card, up his sleeve with River. So the character arc of the captain is certainly a familiar one. But one of Whedon's chief attributes is that he likes to play with established conventions. Every time you think that you are ahead of the characters and that Mal does not know what is about to happen next, you are wrong. So it is nice to play with expectations and Whedon does so, to provide not only humor but some pathos as well (Whedon likes to make you laugh and then give you a reason to suddenly stop laughing).Yes, those of us familiar with ""Firefly"" have an advantage in watching ""Serenity"" because we know the characters, not only in terms of their histories but also their temperaments. That is why we were expecting a lot more cursing in Chinese in this movie. We are also going to be more accepting of attempts to fast forward some of the interpersonal issues that afflict the crew of Serenity, as well as the attempt to suggest what is to come down the road. Whedon could get bogged down in trying to finally untangle the love-hate affair that Mal and Inara have been having, but he rightly keeps the focus on working out the River plotline. Most of the crewmembers of Serenity get their moments, but this film comes down to Mal and River, which is what both the television series and the prologue here have set up. I am perfectly willing to grant that such insider knowledge is worth at least a half-star in terms of rating this film, but that is just the way things break with this movie.Ultimately, I ended up rounding up on ""Serenity"" because in the sequences where River goes to town Whedon tries to do as much of the action as possible in one shot. I am so sick and tired of seeing fight sequences reduced to a rapid fire montage of cuts where I can never tell what is going on. It seems that you do not get to see what is really happening in a fight unless it is not really happening because you are using CGI for your fights (a prime example being Spider-man versus Doctor Octopus in ""Spider-man 2""). But when River takes her turn we get to see what she is doing and enjoy her whirling ballet of death and one of the joys here is watching Glau turn off the crazy little girl routine and show exactly what the Alliance has created. In other words, Whedon provides the payoff we were denied when ""Firefly"" was summarily cancelled after only eleven episodes had aired, which is exactly what the mission statement was this time around."	5.0	"Joss Whedon provides some closure to the ""Firefly"" saga,"	2006-04-13	16	12	4

I really liked the movie.Don&#8217;t worry about getting lost in the show&#8217;s history if you never watched the series.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2DSBRN6SGL6EC	LeeHoFooks	"Sadly, ""Firefly,"" by many accounts one of the greatest television shows ever created, was cancelled mid-way through its first season. Thousands of fans of the show (AKA ""Browncoats"") pressured Fox executives to continue the series, and in 2005, they got their wish. Sort of.""Serenity"" starts out not long after where ""Firefly"" left off, with Mal and the crew (minus Inara and the Shepherd, at first) just trying to survive and keep flying honorably (if not always legally). River (who is still crazy) gets the crew into more trouble than they've ever been in together, and it's up to Mal to lead them out of it. Characters go through some deeper development, loose ends are tied up, mysteries are explained, but of course (Joss Whedon being the cruel showman he is) the ending is left open and the audience craving far more.The film's not perfect. (This is understandable, of course, since it takes the place of what might have been a long, complicated series.) The ""Hands of Blue"" are never explained, and a hacker (""Mr. Universe"") is introduced as if he'd been a recurring character all along. Perhaps he was meant to be, but simply hadn't been introduced to the show yet? Either way, I also found Mr. Universe to be more than a little annoying and clich&eacute;.But aside from those couple of tiny nit-picks, ""Serenity"" is a great film. The action scenes are suspenseful but fun, the one-liners are as witty and hilarious as ever, and a newly-introduced antagonist (a shadowy, black ops type known only as ""The Operative"") is the perfect antithesis to Mal. (He's the sly ninja to Mal's noble cowboy, but I digress...) I think ""Serenity"" is probably a pretty good stand-alone film, but I'd certainly have to recommend watching ""Firefly"" first.No, ""Serenity"" isn't the several seasons worth of episodes the fans wanted (and the show truly deserved), but it's a very fitting end to a series that needed closure.So watch the gorram thing already."	5.0	"Burn the Land and Boil the Sea; At Least We Have ""Serenity"""	2011-07-03	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A363B5MKV13721	Leelioux	"I saw Serenity in the theater because the trailer hooked me - outer space, interesting characters, hot action scenes. I LOVED it because it was so much more than that. We were just so surprised at the depth of characters, the smart wit and chemistry of the crew and an actual plot - rare in a lot of space/action movies. The effects were great, and it was so much more than your average sci-fi movie. And the best part for me was - no cheesie aliens. =)As soon as Serenity was available on DVD, we bought it and have watched it several times. It's our ""go-to"" movie when there's nothing on TV. Every time we watch it, we pick up on something else we missed. I think we've seen it at least 8 times since we brought it home and I'm still not tired of it.From the bonus features we found out about the series Firefly - and still can't believe we didn't know about it when it was on the air. We've since bought the series too, and have been cycling through watching the movie, then the series, then the movie and so on. The movie is stand-alone, and I still see it as a great intro to the show for me, but you pick up on so much more when you get to know the characters through the short-lived series.All I can say is, I'm a converted 'Browncoat' and there's nothing I want more than a sequel to this movie. Everyone I know that borrows it and watches it falls in love with it like we did, and then they borrow the show - and they, too can't believe it was cancelled.The 'Verse Joss Whedon and the crew have created is something special. There's never been anything like it. And I want MORE!!!"	5.0	Addicted to the 'Verse	2006-02-05	10	9	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A19RAJY6R7USN0	"Lee Neville ""emotionboy"""	I'd seen the Firefly television series that this is based on, I'd seen the Serenity movie trailer, I'd read the Serenity official movie magazine and I'd also read the screenplay which is found in the Serenity Visual Companion, so suffice it to say I was prepped and ready to watch.Despite Serenity being released 3 years after Firefly, it is set a mere few months after the television series. In this movie we continue the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his on-board crew. Returning are all the leads from the series including first officer Zoe, her husband the pilot Wash, always looking for a fight Jayne, engineer Kaylie who has a crush on the Doctor- Simon, and Simon's psychic sister River who carries a terrible secret which the Alliance will do anything to keep secret. Also returning are companion Inara and preacher Book who have both left the ship Serenity during the few months between the tv show and the film.So here I was, finally watching this movie that due to its original release date being delayed, I'd felt like I'd waited ages to see, and for the most part it delivered. There was plenty of action, humor, fun and excitement. It was also easy for newcomers to not only follow, but enjoy- something which the Star Trek movies had problems accomplishing. Creator/Writer/Director Joss Whedon though has succeeded on this issue very well.So why did I feel that little bit disappointed?Well, you see the thing is, I've been a fan of Joss Whedon's work for a long time. He has done amazing work on tv shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel. Also, it was in 1992 that he'd written the movie version of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and the director had taken the film in a direction Joss Whedon did not want it to go- now with Serenity he had an opportunity to direct a movie the way he intended and I believe Serenity to be a representation of what Joss Whedon wanted the film to be. Unfortunately, the big screen limits how far you can take the characters because since the movie is on the big screen, the main plot has to take priority over everything else. Thus themes and emotions can get lost. For example, one of the main themes in Serenity is that you should believe no matter what- well I am used to Joss addressing a theme and then taking it further- he didn't take it very far here, and in fact he addressed the same issue in-depth in the Season 5 Premiere of Angel- Conviction. As for emotions- I remember great emotional moments in Buffy and Angel where Buffy killed Angel, Buffy died for the second time and Fred died. All big emotional points that I knew were going to happen long before I actually saw them on screen, yet when I did finally see them, they did affect me. With Serenity I knew the two characters that were going to die because I'd read the screenplay, yet I was barely affected at all because the main plot was the priority at the time in the film. And even when we did finally catch-up to the loss in the funeral scene at the end, I still felt empty. In contrast, whenever I see Spock die in Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan I can still feel the hurt, despite knowing he'll be back in the third Star Trek movie. I get this sense that no matter how many times I watch Serenity, I won't feel the emotion of losing the two characters that died. The family atmosphere established in the series doesn't appear to be as strong either. And the person to blame for that I'm afraid to say is the man himself- Joss Whedon. Granted, I'm sure he made various concessions for the big screen but it's a shame certain opportunities were missed. I actually wanted River to make me cry but she didn't- makes me cry that she didn't make me cry.So in summary, this is a fun movie that should convert newcomers to the Joss Whedon universe and entertain those already loyal to his work, but it doesn't show the true greatness of Joss that I'd hoped for. I only give it 5 stars in this review, because I've already given 4 stars to a lot less. Still, despite any nitpicky flaws, a sequel would be welcome. We may get one we may not. And if we don't, Serenity serves as a somehow appropriate ending to the Firefly and Serenity saga.	5.0	Criticizing Joss Whedon & Serenity	2005-10-09	6	4	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2R81A5S1AJC3F	LeFinn	I had anticipated this movie for over a year.  Having seen Firefly from the start, I was wanting more, and Serenity delivered.  Some people will complain about the 'fanboy' base, or the fact that a movie was made based on a 'failed' television show.  They miss the point.  This is a movie for the viewers, for the fans.  Yes, Joss was effective in making a film that could be understood and enjoyed by a first-timer.  But this film was made for the fans, and that makes it mighty.  Joss fought to make this happen.  We, the 'rabid fanfolk' did what we could to make sure his efforts weren't wasted.  Everybody was rewarded, with something original, with heart, and good story.  Yes, there were differences from the television show, there had to be to make sure that the studio was kept happy, they provided the cash after all.The film itself is just good storytelling.  It's not a mindless blockbuster, or a knockoff of an old property.  It isn't a story about super-heroes with adamantium claws, or the hamfisted epic concerning the rather rapid downfall of a mystical night that kills younglings.  Joss took the best aspects of drama, including comedy.  This is a movie that left me breathless and silent to take in everything I'd seen.  What I came away with was a wanting to see more, and an understanding of characters I loved.This was good storytelling.  If nothing else is taken from this review, take that.  Joss can tell a story, that speaks to the visceral core of human nature, and he does so with the subtlety that comes from years of evolving the craft.  Do yourself a favor, give Serenity a chance.	5.0	No dissapointment., just joy and appreciation.	2005-12-16	29	28	1

It shouldn't have been made, as Joss Whedon himself believes, and yet its sitting on my entertainment center waiting for me to watch it whenever the mood strikes me. I laughed, I cried, I fell down...everything necessary for me to enjoy a movie.The sequence where we are introduced to the crew of Serenity is brilliant, and it just gets better. There are minor discrepencies, such as how do River and Simon end up in the same bar as the rest of the crew after they have separated, but otherwise the plot flowed smoothly.While there are some questions that people may have regarding things that those of us who have seen the television episodes already know, I think that for the most part it can stand alone. On the plus side, the questions people may have on the background on some of the story lines can only lead to more sales for the series DVDs. And for those of you who haven't already, you should check out the score, its pretty fantastic and well put together.	5.0	My fave movie of the year	2005-12-24	10	9	1

Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, Serenity, along with Firefly the Series, is definitely a film worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your DVD collection!

They need to make a living smuggling necessities around the worlds, but can't help but come to the aide of those in need along the way.  In Serenity, you see the over-reaching, too-powerful effects of the righteous law-of-the-land, known as The Alliance.  Our crew, on Serenity, discovers The Alliance's deepest, darkest secret, and fights to reveal the truth so that it can't pretend innocence or ignorance and eventually just attempt their plans again.

Taking each point the detractors have made, here we go1. Weak special effectsAnyone who's seen the series and heard Joss Whedon talk about this film (or knows his past work), knows his shows are not about special effects. If you're into sci-fi for special effects, then Serenity's not for you. If you like story and character development - then you''ll love this.2. Corny dialog -At first, I'm tempted to say ""it's sci-fi, since when has there been good dialog in sci-fi"" but that's not the right in this case. The dialog is how real people talk, it's not sexy or well thought out five minutes in advance. It's not like watching Friends where everyone is ""on"" all the time. Some jokes hit the mark and some don't, it's human nature.Also, if you think the dialog is corny - go back and watch the original Star Wars. Or Empire, or Revenge of the Jedi. C'mon, those things are corn-fests.3. Poor acting -I don't buy that for a minute, I think people's judgement of the acting is clouded by the fact that there are no big names in the film. However, they are all good actors. And a heck of a lot better than some of those $20 million a movie actors.If you're looking for a sci fi movie written with more intelligence and character, and less focused on epic spaceship battles and Death Stars, this is where it's at.

The creation of this movie was totally fan driven.  After the show got cancelled, with less than half a season aired, the fan support drove this movie to be made.Didn't see the show Firefly? Not sure you want to spend your time on it? That's okay!  This movie is totally self-contained. There is no previous knowledge needed to see it.  And for those of you who have seen the show, you don't get beat over the head with exposition.The comentary is excellent.  There's some deleted scenes (maybe some of these should have been left in) and damn funny outtakes.  There's even an easter egg.  Have fun watching.	5.0	Can't Stop the Signal	2006-03-10	2	2	0

Forget about the ""sci-fi western"" crap you may have heard. This is old-fashioned storytelling with fully developed characters you can care about.See Serenity.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3PUVLBMBHDNWT	Lissa	Let me start by saying that I was very excited to see this movie. I was in high spirits when I went to see it in theatres, and I am very easily entertained by movies in general. And yes, I like sci-fi and have a soft spot for fantasy. The plot seemed to have everything going for it. In theory, the idea of a fantasy/sci-fi mixed with western elements sounds intriguing. Really, how could it go wrong? I'll tell you how: bad characterization, bad acting and bad writing. This movie seems to have failed in all those areas. I could barely sit through it. For probably the first time in years, my attention actually drifted in the theater. I was counting the little lights on the aisles because it was more entertaining than watching this mess. The biggest problem I had was with the characters themselves. They felt flat and one-dimensional, and I didn't buy them at all. More importantly, I found them unsympathetic -- especially River. I don't know if it's more a problem with the acting or the script, but I'm pretty sure it's a combination of both. The writing seemed immature to me and just... dull and cliched. The lines were equivalent to those you'd find in a mediocre made-for-TV sci-fi. And the progression of the story was sloppy and disjointed. I would point out the numerous examples, but that would mean watching the movie again, and I would rather watch a movie on UPN. I would advise not to come to this movie with high expectations. Or avoid it altogether; that would be my suggestion.I'm sorry to all of the Firefly fans for disrupting the parade or praise, but I just can't understand how this movie has received so many 5 star reviews. Granted, I never saw any episodes of Firefly myself, but shouldn't a movie be able to stand on its own, to a certain extent? I think it should.	1.0	Extremely disappointing	2007-11-25	99	8	91

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2IX96OBV3BGR3	Liz	After having sat through the series, which I ended up being rather indifferent towards, I decided that I had to see how it ended, so I got myself a copy of this. It was definitely the right decision.There wasn't much Western in sight at all, in _Serenity_, (which was my problem with the original series); it was nearly pure sci-fi, which I truly enjoyed. Finally we have an answer to the problem of River, we see how Simon rescued her and what it is the Alliance is afraid she knows. We finally know where Reavers come from! That alone was pretty awesome.There were some good surprises thrown at us, things I never saw coming, and one that actually brought a tear to my eye, even when I really hadn't cared much about the characters in the series. The action is good, there's plenty of suspense and you really aren't sure, even in the end, if they're going to win or not.Granted, the wrap up of that felt a little...forced, to me, a bit on the dues ex machina end of things, but it was still satisfying. I don't think I would've preferred that they all go out in some sort of _Butch and Sundance_ sort of way. That wouldn't have felt right; I might not be a hundred percent comfortable with how this was resolved, but neither was it bad. Not completely believable, but not totally beyond the realms of belief, either. Not too bad of a mix.This movie does a pretty good job of wrapping up the series while still giving just a hint of leeway for a sequel, or even a second chance at another series. I don't see that happening, not with the networks having their heads stuck in places where sunlight is rare, but stranger things have happened and Joss has shown that he can pull off minor miracles before.	4.0	Better than the series	2006-01-12	8	5	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1ECASBPYJ9QHG	"L. Martin ""karasuman"""	"It seems like everyone is either giving this film 5 stars (because they're fanboys) or 1 star (because they didn't particularly like it).  So this movie was either silver screen perfection or absolute garbage, huh?  That's not the point of reviewing.For fans of the show ""Firefly"" upon which ""Serenity"" is based, the movie will not be a disappointment.  All of the characters from the series return (though Shepherd Book and Inara get relatively little screen time), and the characteristic wit of the cowboy-inspired dialogue never fails to charm and amuse.  That doesn't make this a 5 star movie.While ""Serenity"" was entertaining, it was also very dark, especially compared to the series.  The 'Reavers' feature prominently in the plot, along with their rape-and-cannibalize-everything-that-moves M.O.  Fans of the show might be frustrated to note that the plot of the movie resolves the Simon-River subplot from the show, but does not deal with the pasts of Inara or Book--both of whom obviously had more coming.  (Besides that, the movie did a little rewriting of the backstory--compare the first episode of Firefly with the tale of River's rescue recounted in Serenity.)The main villain for the movie wasn't to my taste.  I'm sure some people thought he was the coolest thing since Star Wars...but the enlightened-monk-meets-fallen-angel is a little too comic book, and a little too overdone, for me.The special effects were nice, but the best thing about Whedon's effects from the show--recognition that space is silent--lost to some bizarre desire to include roaring engines just to prove that it can be done.  The music was nothing special, and the scenery and costumes are not noticeably different from the show.This movie gets 4 stars from me because it's a basically good, entertaining movie...but it isn't going to make it on any non-fanboy top ten lists."	4.0	We have 5 options for ratings, people, not just 2.	2005-12-12	33	21	12

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A6JN3EWXQ3H4B	"Lord Gregor ""Dread Pirate"""	"I remember the first time I saw an episode of Firefly.  THERE WAS NO SOUND IN SPACE!!!!  Just the simple fact of introducing that reality floored me.  I was intrigued.  The rest of the shows lived up to the high expectations that the pilot set.  Great storylines, pithy dialogue, no pandering to pre-teens with some Wesley Crusher type character.  What a shame that the network had to screw it up so badly and air episodes out of order, and then fail to pick it up for a second season.  Their ineptitude probably helped push the big screen version to the level of greatness it achieved though.Without any worry about what to do with a sequel or another season, Whedon came up with a plotline for Serenity that wasn't burdened by the necessity for a feel-good ending where everyone survives.  I thought it was incredible that not only did he choose to ""off"" a few of the major characters, bu that he did it in a believable way.And let's face it, we all were hoping for some further explanation of the Reavers, right?  They were a huge menacing force throughout the series that you never really did get a grip on.  I think his decision to tie that answer into the great chase plot that went on with the assassin after them from start to finish shows what a great touch Whedon has with a story.I can't help but wonder what the HD version of this one looks like.  Sadly, I'll never know, as I don't intend to rereplace all the stuff that I traded in my VHS's for.  Sorry big money entertainment industry.

I am one of those people who went into mourning when 'Farscape' was cancelled.  I also loved all the Star Trek series AND of course, 'StarWars'.  SERENITY is another outstanding addition to that genre.  You have characters that you care very much for, a lot of action, the requisite Sci Fi monsters, space scenes with a lot of futuristic gismos and that beloved touch of romance.  This movie was so good that when it was over, I felt as if I had only been watching it for ten minutes.  In fact, I had to watch all the extras, both with and without Joss' commentary!I have always thought of Joss Whedon as a creative genius.  I watched every single ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"".  The shows were all so cleverly written and highly addicting!  Besides having snappy storylines and wonderful, fleshed out personalities, Joss has  something else in his stories:  Clearly defined 'good' and 'evil' characters.  And, the theme is always good over evil.  Fortunately the good guys won in this film and I hope they will have many more battles to conquer.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1HOLE9R6WPT85	Mad Max	"I can watch this film over & over - simply a joy to watch.The acting is great all around, but especially the ""operative"" Chiwetel Ejiofor (a world-class actor, best known forAmerican Gangsterand another terrific yet underrated sci-fi movie,Children of Men).The script is great - a well-rounded story, very fun. It's witty, and the special effects are great. And, it's got a progressive theme, reminiscent of some of the US government experiments performed on our own citizens (if you're not aware, by the way, about DU/depleted uranium weapons, their use in Iraq, and the Gulf War Syndrome, I'd encourage you to google it ... very similar to the plot in this film). Another friend pointed out the similarity between this plot and the Fluoride added to our water supply - a known poisonous toxin and carcinogen, but contains properties which make us fat, lazy, and docile.Anyway, it's hard for me to believe this came from the same guy who brought us Buffy. The Firefly series was great, too, but actually the movie had a bit more depth, and develops River's character a bit better.It is a bit formulaic in parts, but it departs enough from the mainstream to make it a breath of fresh air. Wish there were more movies like it, and I'm hoping for sequel. 5 full stars."	5.0	A joy to watch - quirky, funny, great special effects... a must own for sci-fi fans	2008-09-13	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"Unfortunately, I have to agree with several of the other writers here, like ""all seeing eye,"" in their comments. Although I enjoyed the action sequences and special effects of the movie, which were spectacular, the movie's strengths just about end there. I still enjoyed the movie despite it's many faults, but a lot things in the movie just don't make much sense or aren't explained. The main plot idea of a telepathic teenage girl, whose powers can be a devastating weapon, although a staple of the science fiction of past decades, is more than a bit shopworn today and hardly robust enough to anchor the entire plot. The idea is also very similar to that of Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, with the government trying to create the ultimate human weapon, except for the telepathy element.Two things that were well done were the planetscapes at the beginning of the movie, which are beautiful. Whedon admits he was influenced by Star Wars, and you can see some of that influence here. The movie soundtrack is good and really adds atmosphere to the movie.In this future, as Whedon says in his commentary, not much has changed. The earth is pretty much the same as it always was--there's just more of it--more people, more pollution, more politics, more intrigue, more technology, and more advanced medicine. People have colonized other worlds and migrated off planet, looking for greener pastures. So far so good. This isn't that different from hundreds of other science fiction stories.But the evil secret that the powers that be want protected is when 30 million people die when a terraforming process on a new planet goes bad. I agree again with ""all seeing eye"" in his review that this doesn't explain River Tam's disturbed psychological state. The Pax drug that is diffused into the atmosphere of the planet is the reason that all the Reavers, who were normal humans once, have been transformed into homicidal cannibals. Pax is a tranquilizer but for some reason that's not explained, it has the exact opposite effect on a small percentage of the population, which just doesn't make sense.Tranquilizers can certainly have bad side effects, such as Thorazine causing tardive dyskinesia (a type of motor tremor), Elavil causing weight gain, and others, but there are dozens of these things on the market and not one has ever, as far as I know, caused people to become homicidal maniacs. Of course in the future they may have all sorts of things we don't have now, but you'd also think they'd bother to test a drug that's going to be deployed in such a fashion and find out if it has any bad side effects. Again, this just doesn't make much sense and takes an otherwise good movie and transforms it into more of a comic book fantasy with poorly thought out and hokey science.The Reavers band together and become marauding space pirates who attack and ravage unsuspecting ships, but they look like the ubiquitous ugly, deformed, humanoid creatures from 1950s science-fiction movies. In the big chase scene, which was great, these baddies are chasing our heroes in their ground flitter. At this point we haven't seen one of them on-screen, but you can also tell they're bad guys because their ship belches out huge clouds of black smoke--so they're polluters as well as bad guys. :-) I don't mean that as a criticism so much as that it turned out to be unintentionally funny.In an early fight scene, a government agent has some sort of stun or paralytic capability, and causes one guy to fall on his sword--that being how a warrior would pay for his failure in some cultures in past centuries, as he says. Although I suppose that's true, again, the whole idea is gratuitous when used in the context of a science-fiction movie. Why would a guy five centuries in the future care about such obsolete customs?  Furthermore, in this future, China and the U.S. have combined into a superpower, but the sword the agent uses is a Japanese design, similar to a short wakazashi. Maybe he was a fan of old 20th-century Kurosawa samurai movies. :-) Still, the fight scenes with the agent, and especially the one at the end between him and Captain Malcolm, are very well done and choreographed, and I say that as a long time martial arts instructor who has occasionally trained movie actors who specialize in martial arts roles.Actually, Whedon does explain it in the commentary on the DVD, but you have to watch that to understand it. Whedon explains that part of the fun of creating a future world is getting to pick out what history you want to include. But it was still hokey.The cast is diverse enough and talented enough so that they could have been standouts if they'd had strong enough material to work with. The cast tries valiantly to make the dialog and script work, though, but unfortunately they're struggling with pretty thin gruel here, but I give them credit for trying. I give the movie three stars for all the action and special effects, which were great, especially, as  Whedon says, the movie was made on a relatively modest budget. But despite the great special effects and action, the story line and the future world imagined here just doesn't quite work. More than anti-gravity would be needed to get this future world and flick off the ground.I did like the concept of the U.S. and China merging to create a great superpower, though. That part was at least interesting.I give the director some credit also for making a movie that does a lot to fill in the backstory for his previous Firefly series. And actually, the fact that the movie was made at all after the original series was cancelled is a great tribute to Whedon. I just wish it had turned out better."	3.0	Great action and special effects	2006-06-10	17	5	12

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3BBB6HKCVNDWO	"Majestic 12 ""MJ12"""	Serenity is the type of movie that we have been waiting for since Star Wars. Simply fun and adventurous.I had never seen Firefly before this movie, but the movie makers had that in mind and clearly aimed to please both those who had seen the series and those who did not as well as fill in the series's backstory. I bought the series after I saw it in theaters.The cast was great and the characters had great 'chemistry.' They just simply worked so well together. My personal favorite character is River. While she has telepathic capability, it is as much of a curse as it is a blessing. You really sympathize with her, especially when the crew gets suspicious of her (I will not spoil anything so I will not say more about her except that the plot of the movie is directly tied to her and her brother). The Alliance Operative (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) is one of the best villains cinema has seen in years.The movies does seem rushed in some parts, events that would take hours or days are completed in minutes. That is forgivable though and here is to hoping for an extended version of the movie.The film's emotional impact is unusually strong, not only for a sci-fi movie but any movie in general. The fighting is tense, you actually fear for the characters, even when you know when they are going to make it. One character dies, but I will not spoil anything. Some parts are tragic while others are humorous. These emotional extremes add a lot of depth to the movie.The special effects are top-notch. The space battle at the end is breif but very memorable. Being hard-sci-fi, there are rarely sounds in the space scenes since sound cannot travel through vacuum (espcially evident in the series). Although the space battle does have sound since it takes place inside an ion cloud. They even included the minute detail of space debris raining down from the battle above and burning in the atmosphere. While the anti-gravity vehicles actually radiate 'heat waves' instead of just appear to be floating while many ships rely on maneuvering thrusters (another minute detail normally left out of movies).Five stars all the way. Here is to hoping there is a sequel!	5.0	I absolutely LOVED this film	2005-12-29	14	12	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1S3BJZKDAEUBV	Malcolm Kantzler	"The short-lived, ""Firefly"" TV series, and its motion-picture successor, ""Serenity,"" are not science fiction, but like Star Trek (which, it seems is forgotten, forged the first fan-recall in TV sci-fi), they are also fan-based, re-born fantasy, but rather in the vein of Star Wars, crossed with the Wild Wild West (of James West), where, without getting too specific, rogues and banded eccentrics, usually shunning fleet ships of the empire, operate their own varietal spaceships (including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, seen streaking the sky during a landing sequence to steal a collectors ray-type gun) between worlds and moons, with environs from sci-fi modernistic to dusty frontier, ground transport from horses to hovercraft, armed with weapons ranging from modified six-shooters, Winchester 1860 carbines, including Steve McQueen's ""Wanted, Dead or Alive,"" sawed-off, large-looped version, to the automatic and large-bore weapons of today's armies, and a partially-effective, futuristic sort of plasma, hand-held device, battling, at the beginning, and then circumventing a victorious, controlling empire in their always-questionably-legal quest to survive each other, their ship, their competition, clients, that empire, and a murderous sect of marauders, feared for their extreme violence, who always threaten but never really materialize until the climactic (but cleverly, also stand-alone) movie.Through all of this, the crew plots-on to keep themselves and their rickety spaceship, named ""Serenity"" intact and supplied when conditions are seldom like their ship's namesake.  The plots and story lines are typical, as they have to be.  But the characters, regardless of their role in the passage they all take together, relate to and interact well with each other, each having their moments without anyone stepping on anyone's toes, contributing to the successful melding that is what makes the crew become more of a family, with characters, like most families, from strange to black sheep and near everything between, of which the viewer doesn't mind becoming a part, sharing the risks, joys, and sorrows, no matter that the circumstances of their existence are tongue-in-cheek.It's good, escapist fun that won't stress your mind, good to have around for those times, every couple of years, when you want to waste some."	4.0	Han Solo, meet James West.	2010-11-10	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A29KEWX5LWDDO4	"map ""Mark"""	With a release date for the DVD of 20 December, prospective viewers would be well-advised to catch the ill-fated TV series 'Firefly' from which the movie 'Serenity' springs (with all original cast in place from the show which was prematurely cancelled by clueless studio execs). You don't need to be conversant with the TV-series (available as a bargain 4-DVD set) to enjoy this film, but it will immeasurably deepen your appreciation. I saw the film, bought the 14-hour series, and saw the film again. But it's still not enough - the future world of 'Serenity' is that good.'Serenity' is something entirely different from formulaic CGI-fests that dominated 2005. It's an impressive sci-fi action story that has the sort of character hooks that makes you feel you know the protagonists and want to live in their tramp spaceship with them. There's not a cardboard cut-out in sight: both heroes and villains have more dimensions than a folded superstring.'Serenity' (and the 'Firefly' precursor) were made by Joss Whedon, the brilliant writer/producer who created 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' for TV. In 'Serenity', Whedon shows how mature he has become - this is writing entirely for grown-ups, whether in the delightfully mordant humour or the breathtaking action sequences. Whedon's masterstroke was in imagining the future 500 years hence, as humans colonize newly terraformed planets, as resembling the frontier of the Old West, a world where shanty towns and seedy space ports long precede the glittering megalopolis and where the arm of the law is short.If the Firely-class ship Serenity is the new Millenium Falcon, then captain Mal Reynolds is Han Solo with a brain, and a troubled back-story as a fighter on the losing side of a war of independence against the governing Alliance. But this is no off-the-shelf Evil Empire, just an overbearing bureaucracy - nine tenths of the human population happily chooses to live under its auspices, after all. So evil, as it appears in the shape of 'The Operative', takes the form of a fanatical believer in the State as guarantor of human happiness. Lethal assassin or no, The Operative is scary because of the intensity of his belief, rather than just the sharpness of his blade.The object of The Operative's hunt is River Tam, the damaged 17 year-old waif with telepathic powers who has been rescued from dire military experiments on psychically gifted children. She and her priggish brother are fugitives from the Alliance, who have taken ship with Mal Reynolds and his crew of hard hitting, wisecracking smugglers and heist artists. River has secrets in her scrambled brain that the Alliance can't allow her to retrieve and so the pursuit across space begins. Mal and the crew of Serenity have to try to evade the Alliance traps until they have time to figure out what the girl knows.The final revelations are utterly worthy of the suspense that builds through the film - a conspiracy of terrifying scope. The crescendo of risk and violence is also of that satisfying sort where characters have to make ever greater sacrifices to do the right thing, a real heroism that is the antithesis of the glib heroics of a Han Solo.But it's almost what is left out that makes Whedon's imagined future that much more plausible. No 'aliens with bumpy foreheads', no noise in the vacuum of space, no wire fighting, no CGI that doesn't advance the plot. Serenity will be an instant 'cult classic' but it deserves a far broader audience. See this film for its screen craft and its respect for the viewers' intelligence: it might be subtitled `for evil to triumph it is only necessary for good men to do nothing'. This is a movie from a director who knows that life and love are bitter sweet, now or 500 hundred years in the future.	4.0	Something new under the sun (wherever that sun is)	2005-11-29	24	23	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2ULSA0IRUE09E	Marc Cabir Davis	"And in many ways, its better than ""Dune"". As a huge science fiction fan, I often find myself snobbish toward less than stellar sci-fi movies, and to be honest, I thought ""Firefly"" at best was a good idea that wasn't given enough time to develop. Needless to say, ""Serenity"" came and blew everyone away.""Serenity"" will always be a very unique and rare film, because its a spectacular combination of special effects, interesting time/space ideas, and a story arc that happily concludes a cancelled TV Series. I doubt you're going to see anything that different for a while.So many science fiction films come and go (""Event Horizon"" anyone?) but more than a year after release, ""Serenity"" continues to bring in new fans and win over more people to the science fiction genre. For that reason alone, this should get five stars.Buy this DVD. You will never have seen anything like it, and this is one movie you can watch again and again without getting bored.

Not that I don't enjoy or respect sci-fi because I do.  However this series/movie presents timeless themes and characters in an interesting, dynamic, engaging and thought provoking way. They could just as easily be cruising around in a beat up old wagon train pulled by ornery horses and one bad ass donkey or for that matter in a rusted out old Winnebago with sticky valves and the story and values would play EXACTLY the same.  These characters are so well written, acted and directed that we feel an almost instant bond with them.  One of the best and most even ensemble pieces ever.

The movie itself  was under 2 hr. when it was released to the theaters for the public to view. Is this due to running time of added extras or material that was excised from the original version. The movie was exceptionaly good. The Movie I would rate at 4 Stars when released in the theaters. But with the lack of information on the Blu-ray steel box release, I can only rate it one star. So with what I have at hand I will be generious and rate this steel box at 2 stars.	2.0	More Information Please!	2013-04-23	151	2	149
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A367PY8E0XVXIY	Mark A. Haley	Serenity stands alone as an amazing film. Coupled with Firefly, it is even better. This movie has a heart, which is what nearly all science fiction films lack nowadays (faux-subtle nod to Star Wars 1,2 &3). The characters are honest, true, and human. The threats are real, the danger is intense, and nobody is safe. I felt connections to every character within minutes of the movie beginning. I have seen it 6 times and each time I am on the edge of my seat, wringing my hands in anticipation. This is a fantastic movie, and while I does not need to be watched in conjunction with Firefly, it is even better after doing so.	5.0	Savior of Sci-Fi	2006-02-05	10	8	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	Back in the fall of 2002, there was a little show on FOX called FIREFLY created by Joss Whedon.  It never did well in the ratings and was pulled about half way through the season.I'll admit I was a casual fan at best of the show, watching about two thirds of the episodes.  Ironically, I really got into it after the cancellation news came out.  My biggest disappointment was that several story arcs were left with big question marks.  What exactly was going on?  Thanks to exceptionally strong sales of the show on DVD, we finally got to find out with this movie.Set 400 years in the future and a few months after the TV series ends, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew aboard the Firefly class star ship Serenity are still outlaws.  They make their living by conducting raids, sometimes for hire, and delivering black market merchandise to far parts of the galaxy.Also on board the ship is River Tam (Summer Glau), a fugitive from the intergalactic Alliance.  She was being programmed for something before she was rescued by her brother (Sean Maher).  The process has left her a shell of her old self, often babbling for no apparent reason.Her presence on the ship also makes the Serenity a much hotter item for the police of the Alliance government then it already was.  This is even more true when one Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) begins a dedicated search to return River to the program.  With the stakes raised, Malcolm makes it his mission to find the truth about River.  What he learns will send shockwaves through the galaxy and potentially bring the Alliance government to its knees.  That is, if the crew can get the truth out there for others to see.As I said, I was only a casual fan of the show and hadn't seen it since it went off the air.  Fortunately, the movie does a good job of reminding us about this particular science fiction universe before jumping into the new action.  This recap is done in an entertaining enough way not to bore those who rewatched their DVD's in preparation for the movie and contains enough background to bring new comers up to speed.Once the new information comes, the movie moves forward quickly.  Action scenes in the beginning are followed by new information that ultimate leads us to a conclusion I didn't expect.  The actors do a good job through all of this, making us care about the outcome.The show had a couple trademarks, both of which are present in the film.  While the show was a science fiction, there were western elements as well, from the planets to the old style weapons characters used.  This allows for some beautiful scenery as the ship is flying over landscapes and through horses.  Additionally, the characters had a very deadpan sense of humor that carries over well to the big screen.My only disappointment with the film was with Joss Whedon's story choices.  As with BUFFY and ANGEL, he felt the need to end this franchise with an apocalyptic finale that all the characters don't pull through.  While this is probably realistic, it's not why I go to the movies.  Also, since both the shows mentioned ended that way, it had a been there, done that feel to it, not the original climax that he was probably hoping for.I often complain when a show I like is canceled without a chance to tie up loose ends, so I'm glad this movie was made.  While it will appeal mainly to those who have seen FIREFLY, those not familiar with the TV show can enjoy it, too.  When I was done watching it, I felt satisfied with the story, even if I didn't like all of it.  While there are places the franchise could go from here, I am quite satisfied to let it rest in peace.	4.0	Satisfying Conclusion for FIREFLY Fans	2005-12-20	16	15	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2VZHT3WH73GTB	Mark J. Minasi	"I wasn't a Joss Whedon fan, nor did I ever watch Buffy, so perhaps I'm missing something.  But I did sit down and watch the Firefly episodes on DVD right before watching the movie on DVD.The series was WONDERFUL.  It's a goofy premise -- a Western set in space -- but who cared?  The ensemble was terrific and the best part of every episode was learning more about a crew of folks, each one of which had a great story to tell.The movie?  Hmmm.  It was clearly a MOVIE rather than a TV show -- its visual scape was wider and richer -- and I wonder if that got Whedon in trouble.  They could have put these guys into a painted refrigerator box and the interaction would still have been fun; having more money for effects seemed to, again, distract.  (Whedon's not the only one this happens to -- look at the original three Star Wars movies before and after Lucas ""improved"" the effects.)SPOILERS FOLLOW...So what was the movie?  Basically a long version of what could have been a single episode.  So what happened?1) It was basically a ""River"" episode.  I don't have a problem with that, although I admit that I found her irritating throughout the series.  But that meant that...2) They spent what, an hour and a half on River?  I'd read that the movie would ""answer the questions"" about Firefly.  What was Preacher's story?  No idea.  We never DID get the backstory on him, and he got about five minutes on the air, none of which were really of any story value.3) Expanding on that... it seemed that Inara (I may be mis-spelling that), Wash and even Kaylie got a fairly small amount of time.  With all of the time in a feature film, was there no space to give each wonderful character a little time in the limelight?  Sure, the Rayne character got to display his caricature of a beer-drinking boob, but that's easy to write and not challenging to act.4) Apparently Whedon wanted to make sure that he didn't have to do any more movies, because he kills off Wash and Preacher in an off-handed manner.5) Finally, it felt eerily familiar.  Re-watch ""Objects in Space"" and you'll find yourself thinking ""hmmm, was this the beta for the movie?""6) Okay, it was a small point, but where was the opening theme?  It was short, lyrical, and sort of poignant.  Whedon says that he wrote it BEFORE he even sketched out the show.  It deserved at least a play in the ending credits.Ah well; good SF shows often become bad movies.  But sometimes they become bad FIRST movies and much better second, third, etc movies.  Too bad this one won't get that chance.But perhaps I'm being too harsh.  This movie was still better any day than fifty blow-stuff-up, cop-buddy-car-chase movies."	3.0	Something of a disappointment after the series	2005-12-22	40	11	29

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AKEJE0HB5BST0	Mark Lee	"From the funk-bluegrass music during the first landing of Serenity through the futuristic-yet-19th-century speech of the worlds of the Alliance and their outcasts, this movie is the coolest quasi-sci fi flick I've seen in many moons.And, oh, the humanity.The last several movies I've gone to I haven't cared about anyone, even the so-called ""good guys.""  In this movie, you have an encapuslation of all that's precious about people in the crew of Serenity: A flawed yet earnest captain, a right hand man who's barely under control, a darling-yet-tough ship's engineer who flits and fights, and a host of associated off-ship cohorts who form a saving network for our crew.  And they really are ""our"" crew, almost from the start.And the ""bad guy"" in this film is equally complex and wonderful.  Like Eric Hoffer's ""true believer,"" he's relentless and passionate in his pursuit of Serenity and her cargo.  But he's no cardboard cutout.Obviously, I loved this film and don't want to give away too much.  The ending talk between the two shipmates in the flight chairs about what keeps the ship together was the icing on the cake.I've seen this film twice in a week, and I hardly ever do that."	5.0	A Gem of an Interstellar Western	2005-10-19	11	10	1

The movie industry puts out way too few really good sci-fi flicks each year.  The shear number of horror movies dwarfs the handful of good sci-fi movies available to rent.  I wish the industry would try to do more with this genre.  I keep my fingers crossed that some brave, brilliant producer/director team will come along one of these years and dazzle us with a new magnificent journey beyond the stars that shakes us to the core, disturbs our sense of reality, and trivializes our silly politics, religion and self-centeredness.  We need a new breed of writers and directors who will raise the bar and present the viewing public with an experience to make us cry, laugh, think and learn something new.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1EXS156IQG7OA	Mark R. Whittington	"A wonderous vision of the future started in the all too short run of the TV series Firefly continues in the big screen version of it, Serenity. The TV show and movie is about the crew of a star ship that is as much unlike the USS Enterprise as it can get. It's a ranshackle freighter skippered by Mal Reynolds, a man part Han Solo, part Jesse James. He was on the losing side of an intersteller civil war against the Alliance, a buraucratic, oppressive government that seems to consists of people who believe quite fervently they know better than other people how they should live their lives. Captain Reynolds and his motley crew, including his former second in command from the war, her husband the pilot, an engineer who is as cute as she is sharp with the hyper drive, a muscle bound mercenary in a constant state of mutiny, a preacher, a courtesan, and a doctor and his troubled (to say the least!) sister eck out a thin living doing odd jobs out on the frontier, some of them not exactly legal. They bicker and at times almost come to blows. Especialy due to the fact that the doctor's sister is wanted by the Alliance government for having been ""enhanced"" and damaged by a top secret government labortory.Oddly enough, this crew might well save the human race among the stars. The story is a paean about how the unlikeliest people can become heroes and how the right of individuals to live free if an absolute. I hope there will be many more films in this ""verse."""	5.0	Still An Outstanding Space Opera	2005-11-02	79	74	5

Especially after seeing the DVD release. However, the Serenity Blu-ray was one of the first titles I purchased on Blu-ray, recently, after purchasing my first Blu-ray player. I have to say that I was duly impressed with the picture quality and the audio quality.If you're thinking that this is just a regular release and that picture quality isn't that great, then you would be mistaken. Not only are the image crisp and clear but on a 32"" HDTV, the detail just blew me away. I'm anxiously waiting to purchase the Firefly television series on Blu-ray. I think science fiction is one of the few genres that take advantage of this new technology.With current movies that are filmed in digital of HD technology, the picture quality will absolutely blow you away. I can't say much for the sound since I have yet to purchase a sound system but the sound quality is a whole lot better than the DVD version.If you're on the fence about this title on Blu-ray, I would highly recommend this Blu-ray release because I think you'll be impressed.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1SMRHBPIB3O1H	Marlowe Syn	Great TV series and a great movie.  While the movie may not be as good for people unfamiliar with the TV series.  It is still the best scifi movie of 2005.  Sure Star Wars looked great, but that was about it.  At the time of my review(20:56 11/31/05) Serenity was the #2 selling DVD on Amazon, with Firefly DVD being #3.  So there is definitely an audience for quality scifi with humor.  The question is:  Where was the movie theater audience?  The movie was well written, acted and produced.  All for a measly Hollywood budget of $50M.  Joss Whedon shows that he is a more than capable movie writer and director.  The sound and picture look great.  The extras, while not abundant more than make up for it with quality.  The deleted scenes are fantastic.  And the gag reel is hi-larious.  It shows just how much fun the cast had making this movie.  Truly a labor in love.  A must have for any true scifi fan.The one minor gripe I have is of the chinzy DVD case.  It feels flimsy and for any viewers that buy movies to watch many times over will probably eventually break the clasps that keep the case closed.	5.0	Serenity now and again later	2005-12-31	11	10	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AK53SOXQ580CH	Martha May	SERENITY is a awesome movie! The special effects are really fantastic! The story line revolves around River Tam (Summer Glau) whose brain holds a secret the Alliance doesn't want known. They send out an assassin to find River so they can control her. Captain Malcolm Reynolds, so aptly and brilliantly played by Nathan Fillion, protects her and her brother, Simon. He tries to stay one jump ahead of the assassin and this makes for edge-of-the-seat action. The one disappointing aspect, (to me, anyway), is that the relationship between Mal Reynolds and his lady love, Inara Serra, (Morena Baccarin), is not expanded or explored more fully. She sticks with him through thick and thin, and in the end, he doesn't seem to appreciate her devotion to him or show that he's really glad she's staying aboard Serenity.	5.0	SERENITY	2011-09-20	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A15QYJXCG0CPNL	"Marvin Brooks ""Marv"""	FIREFLY has only been around for a couple of years as a failed TV show on a 4th network, and now it's a failed feature film. It didn't connect or resonate with ANYBODY beyond a very limited (and primarily English-speaking) fanbase. And here's the cruelest cut -- I don't think it will stand the test of time. FIREFLY/SERENITY is too dependent on *other*, more popular creations for its context. It *needs* STAR TREK and STAR WARS to play off of. It's not so much an original creation as a parody/pastiche of more substantial works. Its referential humor and storytelling falls flat otherwise.That's the problem with parody. It generally fades over time. And FIREFLY ain't none too popular to begin with.

Why?  Because the series was cancelled, but the people made enough noise that the movie was actually made.Perhaps, We The People can even bring back the series, who knows?Now for the review ... we start with our two most obviously mysterious crew members, Doctor and River Tam. Brother and Sister.  Little sister had been taken mysteriously, while our genius Doctor was in Medical College ... he throws it all away to rescue her.  The mystery lies in what has been done to her, and what has she become?There are a few Ice Floats in here, but suspend your disbelief, because it is worth it.  The crew of Serenity, a Firfly class starship, each have their own histories, but they are neither the bad guys (Reevers - an unknown race or mutation of humans that feed only on living humans - Really, Really bad guys) but somewhere in between.The cast works together as if there had been no time lost between ""FireFly"" going off the air and ""Serenity"" being filmed.  They are a family, they bicker, they laugh at each other, get on one another's nerves, but unite when and one of them is truly endangered.And they are up against the ultimate bad guy ... a man who is fervent, unshakable, fanatical faith that the ends justifies the means.  He claims that no one can make him angry, and he is after some one in our crew ... so why?  This man would turn the universe upside down to get what he wants, and apparently has the financial backing to do so.Check out the trailers, try to catch ""FireFly"" on SciFi, or better yet, buy the series on DVD.The magic created here is behind the scenes, but will draw you in.  After FireFly was cancelled, We The People wanted more, wanted it so much that we made a difference - just imagine!Get to know these characters, this universe, and if you like it, let your voice be heard as well.Can we bring back the series ""FireFly""?Can we have another movie of ""Serenity""?We The People have done it once, so nothing is impossible.

I don't watch that much TV.So much was then introduced so quickly that I had to assume it would be explained further on and just go along with it. It was and it worked, as the presentation did make me want to get that explanation. On board ship, I immediately felt the connection to the Millenium Falcon. I was quite happy to spend some time with the fringe element, far from the bridgedeck. Now what's going on in those terraformed worlds? Wouldn't it be interesting to see how many ways that might turn out?No bad make-up or improbable costuming...believable is good. The action flows well-the pace is quick and stunts are smooth; yet, there's room for spurts of decent dialogue to advance the plot and create some depth of character. Granted, in this amount of time, many are still a 'cartoon', i.e., a quick study.The extras do give a bit of background. I will have to see more of Firefly on DVD, as I gather that depth was being developed there. How on earth did this NOT make it on TV?	5.0	My son sprang this on me...thanks!	2005-12-27	9	8	1

Even if you weren't a lover of Firefly (but I am!), this movie would have you hooked.  What happens and how things work out are lovely.  There are some deaths that I didn't like, but it was a movie and the TV show isn't around anymore (Why is that???), so I am assuming that Joss decided it was time to show some kind of ending.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AUKLGT6OSNMW9	Mason Cole	"For those of you who've never seen Serenity, you're in for a treat.  By all rights, this film should have done for Joss Whedon what Batman Begins--the best film of 2005--did for Christopher Nolan.  It's got heart, it's got laser battles, a timely message of interstellar poverty...(wait, I'm channeling another Whedon show!)  I'll come right out and admit my bias.  I am a huge Joss Whedon fan.  But there was a time when I would never have been caught dead within ten country miles of him.  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer?"" I would scoff.  ""Please.  I have better taste than to watch THAT.""  Then I did.  Then I started watching Angel.  Then I was on board for the launch of Firefly.  And the rest, as they say, is history.If you're unfamiliar with Firefly, the TV series off which Serenity is based, here's a mental picture for you.  Imagine a universe much like the ones you've seen on Star Wars and Star Trek.  (Mostly Star Wars.)  Rich, opulent planets flush with technology; a galactic government with an amazing fleet at its disposal; touches of the exotic and elegant abounding.  Now imagine the people who have no money, who live on the edge of that world, scrounging a living off planets not unlike Tatooine.  Laser weaponry is not out there.  They have to make do with old-fashioned revolvers.  And they dress, and speak, as if they were 19th-century American cowboys...the difference being that the rhythm of their speech patterns has a flowery blank-verse deftness to it, much like something a rustic Shakespeare might have written.  Then stretch a story across nine characters from all different backgrounds and walks of life, throw in more backstory than the Hundred Years' War, and drop it all on an outdated but sturdy spaceship.  Now you've got a conception of about 1/10 of Firefly.Serenity, sadly, has to jettison many of the Western elements in favor of a more traditional action-movie setup.  But as an action movie, it's quite brilliant.  As a comedy, it's sharp and playful.  As a drama, it's touching and occasionally rises to the level of real tragedy.  As science-fiction, both the concepts and the CGI can be a little shaky (Reavers ahoy), but then again, very few Hollywood films rise to the level of real sci-fi.  This film, while asking for far more of a suspension of disbelief than most of its genre brethren, makes up for it by providing a rollercoaster ride of an experience, thrusting you into its backstory and then its main story so quickly that you barely have time to breathe.  People not disposed to wait for the payoff will quickly grow bored, but for the patient viewer, this film eventually pays back ten times what it asks from you.So why only a four-star rating?  Let's be honest.  The film is good, with great moments.  It has, however, the unenviable task of wrapping up as many Firefly plotlines as possible while still standing on its own as a film.  That it manages to do this, even to a partial extent, is frankly amazing.  Still, some characters that were major players in the series are little more than glorified window dressing here...the same problem that plagued the Star Trek: TNG movies.  There are also some moments in the film which jarred me so much as a fan that I was unable to fully enjoy the theatrical experience.  (Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that for a film involving, however peripherally, the demise of millions of people, Whedon could have greatly improved my viewing experience with just a couple fewer deaths.)Still and all, these are small complaints.  Though Batman Begins is a superior film, Christopher Nolan had many luxuries Joss Whedon did not...a far superior budget; the weighty resumes of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson; and years of stories to sift through to get everything right.  Whedon, however, in inventing this universe from scratch, has the advantage of malleable material to shape into his stories.  He stretches his budget to the limit to turn in a beautiful, if rough, film.  And he takes advantage of top-notch performers like Nathan Fillion and Chiwetel Ejiofor who aren't household names...but soon will be.If you can only find room in your budget for one genre DVD purchase, and you don't think this is it, then stretch your budget.  This film is a must-own."	4.0	So, So Close...Second-Best Genre Film of 2005	2005-11-16	19	15	4

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2S597N1HATNM8	Matthew Chase	"When it comes to writing a genre piece that shouldn't necessarily work, Joss Whedon answers the call. He did it first with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the titular character played by a valley-speaking blonde cheerleader who saved the world more than once. While the transition from movie to TV also caused some shifting in seats, the show became more than a simple cult classic; say the word Buffy, and the words Vampire Slayer are seldom far behind.While going the other way (from TV to movies) with a 'space-western,'his prematurely canceled show ""Firefly,"" Whedon shows he's able to keep the spirit of the show alive on the big screen, developing a plot that raises the stakes considerably (quieting fears of longtime fans that it would just be a two-hour episode)and somehow leaving the characters much as we left them. The crew of Serenity, led by Capt. Malcom Reynolds, a soldier on the losing side of the massive space war that forced him to a life of crime, is the focus of the film.It matters only in a general sense that this film takes place in the outer reaches of space in the future, save its creation of a setting that allows a singular focus on the players involved. The characters are what drive it, and they drive it fast and hard. The plot's pace never slows, even if the space travel sometimes does. There is the obligatory space battle, which should more than satisfy any fan of large explosions and nifty spaceships. But there is also plenty of dialogue, and plenty of moments shared between just a few characters that will elicit laughter (my theater roared at a few particularly clever moments) and tears (for spoilers sake those won't be mentioned here).The villain has depth; this deserves mention on its own as it rarely happens. It's not hard to understand why the villain does what he does, and this is a credit to the fair play the writer gives his characters. I hope that the reader understands I'm not shortchanging the actors. While the words are Whedon's, the people he chose to bring these words to life also make the characters the force they are in the film. For a movie like this, those who haven't seen the show will enjoy the show with a fresh look. Those who have, well, they probably don't need a fan like me telling them.Ah yes, the cat's out of the bag. Given the rating, I doubt many thought I hadn't seen the ill-fated series Firefly. So I touch now upon the touchiest of subjects: will people who haven't seen the show get as much out of the film? I have to say, with a sorrowful heart, no. There is a great deal of backstory between the characters, and while this is made as clear as it can be in the two or so hours that the silver screen shines, it can't compete with 14 episodes (3 unaired) of television to set that up. Here comes the twist (it's a Whedon production, folks. These happen). It doesn't matter. If you haven't seen the show, you don't know what you're missing. And I mean that literally. You can tell that there's a history there when the movie pops up, but the characters are well-developed within the confines of the film. Would you be more comfortable with some of the language if you'd watched the show? Absolutely. Will people who didn't see the show not care about the characters? Doubt it. My wife, who'd never seen the show, laughed at all the right places, and cried with me at all the right places.My final grade is high. 5 stars, A, whatever abstraction you want to use. But go see the movie. I couldn't touch on the comparison to other sci-fi movies I've seen recently in the limited space here, but I've seen a lot of them. Serenity gets the nod each and every time."	5.0	Space western? That would never work!!! Or would it.	2005-10-05	8	8	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1ET1NZ7QZKN6M	Matthew Tundermann	Firefly was unfairly cancelled before it ever got the chance to take off.  Perhaps if the show had started off on the SciFi channel like Battlestar Galactica instead of Fox, it would have had room to grow and build a fan base, that ironically, has grown stronger since the series was released to DVD and shown on the SciFi channel.Because Firefly was never taken down the story lines that Joss Whedon obviously started laying the groundwork for in Season 1, Whedon uses Serenity to fill in the backstory and move forward with one of the more enigmatic characters, River.  Due to scientific experimentation by the Alliance, River is an emotional and mental wreck, which conflicts with her physical grace and overwhelming intelligence.  Her brother, Simon, has risked everything he has to save River and keep her hidden from the Alliance.  The rest of the crew of Serenity, against their better judgements but in tune with their underlying sense of morality, have sheltered both Simon and River.During the series, several situations occur where the entire crew face perils associated with the Alliance's attempts to recapture Simon and River.  The movie continues that storyline with a nameless Operative, who's only mission is to recover River for the Alliance at all costs.  He pursues Serenity across the galaxy, killing whomever and destroying whatever he needs to to accomplish his goal.  In the end, the crew of Serenity discover why the Alliance view River as a threat and again, against their cutthroat natures, make the moral choice of exposing that secret.  The final showdown between the Operative/Alliance, the crew of Serenity, and a dangerous third party is spectacular.If you havent' seen Firefly, I recommend picking it up first to get some backstories for the crew.  First time viewers maybe confused by the seemingly high-tech sci-fi background of the show being mixed in with the low-tech aspects of old westerns.  I can't explain it, but it works.  All I can say is that the Serenity and its crew operate on the edge of civilization and the western frontier feel helps convey the rough-around-the-edges way in which they live and survive.  The dialogue is humorous, especially from Captain Malcolm Reynolds, despite the serious nature of the show.  The writing is superb and I can only wish that the fan support again grows to the level where Joss Whedon makes another series or movie.If you are a fan of the series and for some reason have not been able to see the movie yet, well, what are you waiting for.  I won't tell you who, but the crew does suffer some losses.  You'll have to see the movie to find out who.	5.0	Still wanting more	2006-09-11	8	8	0

Although this is a spin off from a TV show, this film absolutely kicks ass. It is the freshest, most exciting and memorable sci-fi flick in recent memory. I'd say that apart from the cracking effects, design, score, acting and costume, the most remarkable element is absolutely the script. Dialogue that really breathes life into the lovable characters and malice into the baddies. Punchy but never corny one-liners and a mixture of sarcastic and slip-on-banana style humour. I'm massively tired of Hollywood movies and although this film was made there, it has none of the formulaic schmaltz or predictability of a Hollywood movie. It has a truly dynamic and surprising plot that is always credible, always surprising and nothing is ever resolved by recalibrating the disconbobulator.If you like this movie, go buy the TV series Firefly. It's 630 minutes of the same stuff. In your face Fox Television! This film ROCKS!	5.0	Hollywood has goofed! They've made an great Sci-Fi movie!	2006-02-15	12	11	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A35VB8EDAKLYXX	"Maylevaih ""Lover of Storytelling"""	Maintaining that level of tension for so long wore me out. It's not all in your face action/violence tension. Often the tension comes from conflicts between characters. Or with one character struggling with their own choices. Of course, the creepy villian and downright disturbing Reavers add to the tension nicely. (You understand quickly why the characters quake in their boots at the very mention of Reavers.)Aside from the tension, Serenity has good pacing, solid action, great balance of humorous and deadly serious dialogue, great characters, and even a few moments you know are just to give you a thrill and you love it because you crave those old-fashion thrills.I have only one quibble, which I have a hard time quibbling about. So much is packed into Serenity... It's rather frantic and hard to dig deeply into all that is revealed. But I know why the film-maker put it all in Serenity, and I'm grateful I got to see all of these things, even if it was something of a tight fit.And I just want to know: is it too early for DVD preorders?	5.0	Woah.

But, unlike most of the Trek movies (or, indeed, The X-Files movie) both Serenity and Khan actually feel like...well, movies.  And not like bloated 2-parters of their original TV shows.All things considered, I haven't enjoyed a SciFi (or is it ""SF"" now?) movie this much since Star Wars' Empire struck back.But is Serenity perfect?  Probably not.  Nine main characters is great in an ongoing series, where different episodes can focus on different characters, but in a stand-alone movie?  Not so much.And, on the TV series, each episode could also have a different theme: Action (""War Stories""), Comedy (""Our Mrs. Reynolds""), Drama (""Out of Gas""), Existentialism (""Objects in Space""), Horror (""Bushwhacked""), Pathos (""The Message""), Satire (""Jaynestown""), Thriller (""Ariel"")...and so on.The movie, however, is forced to juggle all these many different characters and themes.  Although, it must also be said that it does so, successfully, more often than not.  (Unfortunately, the ""not"" would be Ron Glass' glorified cameo...couldn't we maybe spend a little more time with him on an extended cut for the eventual DVD release?  Please?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q0DSLVFHMK25	MD-4-Christ	"I personally believe that Serenity was a really good movie. But only because I saw the firefly series. I had my gripes about firefly (hated the whole glorified Whore/""Companion"" idea) but I really got into the characters themselves. Serenity takes off where the canceled Firefly ended. But if you are new to the whole world of Firefly/Serenity then it will definately take away about half the enjoyment of the movie. Why? Because Serenity is a ""Great"" 'continuation' of the series and a ""Good"" stand-alone movie. If you've never seen the Firefly series but watch Serenity, here are a few questions you probably will be asking after:1. How did Mal and the crew meet each other and how did they end up on Serenity?2. Who or what is a 'Sheperd' and why did he leave Serenity?3. When Jayne and Mal were arguing on the ship, what ""War"" was he talking about that made Mal and Zoe get so upset?4. Why did Inara leave Serenity?These are some of the questions new-comers will probably be asking after seeing Serenity. Now Firefly fans know that these questions are all answered in the series' episodes. If you check, most of the people who gave this movie 1-3 stars have admitted to never actually seeing firefly. But I think the movie felt short and they could have added more onto it to make it more fulfilling, like doing something more with the Mal and Inara relationship (hopefully to stop her from selling her body), or show some new flashback scenes from the war of 'Serenity Valley' to answer question number 3 and further grip fans.So why the 5 stars?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2OIG88PG8K4M3	"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado"""	"For fans of the prematurely cancelled ""Firefly"" series, Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" will be an early Christmas present, full of delightful touches, references to the series, and hints about answers we have longed looked for.Unlike many television shows transferred to the big screen, however, ""Serenity"" is a movie that can stand on its own merit as a solid space opera, enjoyable for everyone, not just ""Firefly"" geeks. It also proves that a good movie doesn't require star-power; ""Serenity"" boasts no superstar names or big-time directors, but the performances are all heartfelt, with a quality of realness and depth frequently lacking in genre movies. Unlike the Star Wars prequels, we can believe the characters of ""Serenity"" are not only real, but are like us. Indeed, Whedon has a sense of classic space opera that Lucas should envy.Joss Whedon's vision of the future - once described to me as ""Star Wars, but Han Solo's world, with Han still shooting first"" - is possibly the most original I've encountered in movies of this kind, an amalgam of Westerns, science fiction, and classic fantasy, sprinkled liberally with Chinese culture. This is a world where characters dress like cowboys, fly spaceships, and curse in Mandarin. But despite this seemingly non sequitur mix, Whedon manages to blend it all into a cohesive, engaging whole.And how it does engage! The film opens with a lesson on the colonization of other worlds - in a process called ""terraforming,"" supposedly making other planets similarly inhabitable to ""Earth-that-was"" - and how the Alliance (a powerful and hyper-controlling government coalition) made war on the lesser colonists, the Independence movement (or ""Browncoats""). The Alliance won. Now the war is discussed in sterile classrooms, where the children don't understand why anyone would resist the ""progressive"" Alliance.Nobody except a young girl named River Tam, that is. She is precocious, sensitive, brilliant; we sense she is probably too smart for her own good. And this proves true as we are jolted from the bright white summer classroom to an unfriendly blue-lit lab, where an older River is being experimented on by the Alliance. Doctors have taken her natural intelligence and grace and made her a weapon, a deeply empathetic psychic with extraordinary gifts as a ""Reader"" and an assassin's knack for martial arts combat. The side-effects of this procedure have left River prone to psychotic episodes, a damaged and mentally fragile seventeen-year old who says things that even she doesn't understand.Her brother Simon, a talented doctor, rescues her from this (at the expense of his career and his fortune), and from this rescue the film's perspective shifts again, this time to a nameless Operative whose sole purpose is to capture River and bring her back. He is a ""believer,"" with a dangerous conviction that finding River is necessary to bring about the utopia he envisions as the future, and an unshakable belief that nothing is too great a sacrifice in his quest. He will find River and kill her, and if doing so means killing everyone in his way, then that is an acceptable sacrifice. Nothing, it seems, is more dangerous than belief.What he does not know is that River and Simon have been hiding on the spaceship Serenity. Serenity's crew are a strange mix: warrior woman Zoe, geeky pilot Wash, gentle and sweet mechanic Kaylee, and Jayne, a blunt, man's man type who loves his guns but has his tender moments too. Leading this ragtag crew is Captain Mal Reynolds, a man of great determination, who we sense is at heart a good man, but not without flaws. They speak in a blend of nineteenth-century Western, futuristic tech-talk,  and Whedon's trademark dry, wacky humor; ""Serenity"" may just have the most original dialogue this year. Most of the characters are drawn in broad strokes - there is not the time in a two-hour movie for ""Firefly""'s development-heavy style - but they engage our emotions in a surprisingly deep way; by the time bad things start happening to them, we care. Very much.And happen they do, often in ways we are not expecting. The plot is many-layered and complex; it will suffice to say that River, a psychic exposed to a roomful of government officials, knows terrible secrets that the Alliance wants contained at any cost. Keeping River from the Alliance Operative and trying to discover the truth about what horrific knowledge is eating at her brain provides the framework for the action, of which there is a great deal, forming a sort of highly-engrossing space chase that Lucas only dreams of.There are no aliens in ""Serenity."" The principal enemy is the Alliance and its nameless assassin, but there are other foes as well. The most horrific of these are the Reavers, a gruesome, nearly-mythological band of mutilated men. They were once human, we are told, but having gone to the furthest reaches of space despaired and forgot themselves, cutting on their own flesh and cannibalizing others. The truth, as we learn, is more simple and more harrowing.It is touches like these that make Whedon's world simultaneously so familiar and so foreign, and ultimately so fascinating to watch. ""Serenity"" succeeds not only as a space adventure, full of strange sights and stirring battles, but as a character-driven story that grabs us, pulls us in, and forces us to care about its people. It delivers on both counts with a gripping, homespun immediacy unlike anything else I've seen.A warning for devoted Browncoats: there are moments that will make you laugh, moments that will shock you, and moments that you will deny until the end. I haven't cried this much in a movie since ""Return of the King"" - and I am not one who routinely weeps at the movies. I also haven't laughed this much at the movies this year. ""Serenity"" has joy and sorrow, humor and pain, loss and sacrifice and gain. Whedon has succeeded in crafting an elegant, gripping story that fully captures our imaginations and our hearts. Here's hoping there are many more to come."	5.0	Space Adventure with a Story	2005-10-01	20	18	2

I don't buy DVD movies much, only a few or so, and if I do buy one it wouldn't be a movie that I have already seen, only one that I have heard good things about from my friends.  But this movie was an exception, though I have seen this movie about 5 times, I couldn't resist buying it for under 6 bucks.  I even went ahead and bought the Firefly series for an incredible price as well.  I remember watching the television series and watching this movie in the theaters.  I really liked this series, I don't understand why this series was canceled, I thought it was very popular, at least it was with my kinds of people.  Nonetheless, I am glad a big screen movie was made from this television series.  I would watch a Serenity 2 now if they made one.  I recommend this movie because of bond this crew has for one another, and the action scenes are fun to watch as well.  A good movie overall.  I highly recommend this movie.

I can only add, that, I enjoyed it as much as the series for TV. Yet it stands alone too, for those who haven't seen the series yet. I recommend watching the TV episodes first, naturally, because that's the order in which I enjoyed Joss Whedon's pot pouri of fascinating characters (Serenity's crew). The plot driving the series is finished chillingly in this movie: evidently, Whedon took what was going to be Season Two and parts of Three, and wove them into a finished tale in the film. He did this very successfully, in my opinion.The reason why this is my favorite science-fiction movie is because it isn't a ripoff or clone of the genre. So much of it is unique that it is a fresh experience, even for jaded sci-fi fans.	5.0	My Favorite Sci-fi movie	2008-01-18	2	1	1

Saw Serenity and loved the movie. Saw the series, loved that too. Watched to interview at the commicon (sp?) and, well, you get the picture.Serenity is a great scifi story with lots of unexpected twists and turns that keeps the mind not only asking ""what's next?"" but ""why?"". The mystery of it all keeps this story moving on a fast track as wee tidbits are revealed here and there but cannot really be pieced together until the decision is made to follow where the mystery leads. It's an intriguing mystery with fascinating characters and mind-boggling adventures. What's not to like?One of my favorite parts? How Mal gets hoodwinked into a mission against his will.

Also if you leave it playing in your BD player after the movie is over, after a few minutes, it goes silent and has a nice Universal Icon rotating against a nice quiet background.  As opposed to lots of other dvds/BDs that just keep playing the movie music tune over and over and over again until you turn it off or select something else. I totally enjoyed the movie like new.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"After a short-lived (15-episode) sci-fi TV series named ""Firefly"" that aired between 2002 and 2003 was canceled, a large cult following had developed.  Series producer/creator Joss Whedon (who created & produced the 1997-2003 TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", as well as the 1999-2004 TV series ""Angel"") was able to direct and write the 2005 film ""Serenity"" based upon the ""Firefly"" TV series and let the cast of the TV series reprise their roles in the film.  Taking place some 500 years in the future, a former galactic war veteran named Captain Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) is the captain of a transport ship named ""Serenity"".  His hired crew includes Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres), pilot Hoban 'Wash' Washburne (Alan Tudyk), former soldier Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) and engineer Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite).  With mankind having ravished the Earth, humans have colonized other planets and satellites, which are under the control of a totalitarian government called the Alliance.  Simon Tam (Sean Maher) helps to rescue his sister River (Summer Glau) from the Alliance, which has experimented on her brain, giving her strong telepathic powers.  Taking refuge aboard Serenity, Mal and his crew protect Simon & River, but also discover some horrible secrets about Alliance activities & cover-ups while a highly trained Alliance assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) hunts them down.With superb special effects, great cinematography, a gripping plot and very engaging characters, ""Serenity"" was a superb piece of science fiction and higly deserving of a 5 out of 5 star rating. Sadly, while the film received much attention & awards from various science fiction academies, it received no attention from the Academy Awards.  Other notable characters from the film include Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz) and Inara (Morena Baccarin).  Whether or not you were a fan of the short-lived ""Firefly"" TV series, but enjoy good science fiction, you should consider viewing ""Serenity"", which I highly recommend."	5.0	Superb & Underappreciated Science Fiction	2007-12-18	3	3	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3TUZOJZM9008Y	"Michael A. Brown ""maniacmedia"""	"Writer/director Joss Whedon had a daunting task ahead of him when making ""Serenity"". He had to appeal to a hearty fan following, and bring in people who were new to the product. Did he succeed? We'll see when the box office numbers star rolling in. But here is my assessment.From the fan side of things, not only are you battling their desire to see more of their beloved ""Firefly."" But you are also at odds with the anticipation of the new episode. Anticipation can kill a movie before it gets started. How do you live up to three years of desire? On this, I was initially worried. The first scenes are a little slow moving, though important from an exposition standpoint. Ultimately though, from the fan perspective, I believe the movie is a roaring success. Even though some of the primary cast get little more than a scene or two.Captain Malcolm Reynolds - Mal is a much darker version of the character from the series. Rarely do we see the mischief. That gleam in his eyes. This time out, he's deadly serious. Credit Whedon and Nathan Fillion for taking that kind of a chance with their leading man.Wash - One of the great elements of the series was the occasional Wash wisecrack. Even if it was in Chinese. Alan Tudyk is given a couple of moments, but nothing memorable.Zoe - Aside from the usual, Zoe doesn't get a lot of play here either. Her one big moment comes off more like her one big half-moment.Kaylee - Curiously, our little Kaylee has taken to verbally slapping Mal around. Obviously less meek than in the series, she keeps turning the knife in his back in a way that was formally in playful jest.Jayne - The big, out for himself, lug has some fun lines. Almost all of which have been in the trailers. And he seems uncharacteristically heroic in the action scenes. Protecting others before worrying about himself. The rest of the time, he's Jayne.Simon Tam - The good doc gets more to do than some of his shipmates. He also seems to be the same person we knew from the series. Focused on helping his sister recover from what the government did to her.River Tam - Second only to Mal, this is her movie. Summer Glau acquits herself fairly well in the action sequences. She's a dancer, and Whedon took full advantage of that with the fight choreography.Inara - Morena Baccarin looks great on screen. No doubt about it. For the life of me, I can't remember if she actually has any lines in this movie.Shepherd Book - Gets a couple of nice little scenes with Mal. Not much else.Apparently, a number of scenes were shot which would appeal more to the fan base. But Whedon excised them in favor of making the film less in-joke and more accessible. While they may end up on the DVD, he's vowed against a ""Director's Cut"" of the film. Maybe we won't have to suffer the endless ""Really, Really Special Edition"" DVDs here.Trying to forget what I know about the show, I think the movie will play alright for the uninitiated. While there have been a few shortcuts taken (i.e. - Why Inara left Serenity.) The vast majority of the film plays out very well. If people let go of the ""failed TV series"" thing, they should have a good two hours."	5.0	Somebody tries to kill your show... make a movie.	2005-11-08	14	10	4

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	I tried to walk away from this movie, but Serenity wouldn't let me.My wife rented Serenity after watching it at a science fiction convention, but the DVD skipped at a critical part.  She was so frustrated that she got up and left.  So she finally rented Serenity from Netflix and, on Mother's Day, brought it over to watch with my parents.  I had no intention of watching the movie.I was about to go upstairs and do something else.  But I forgot whatever it was I planned to do. I stood on the stairs, looking over my shoulder as the credits rolled.  And I stood there for five minutes, transfixed. A few minutes later, I sat down and watched the whole film.Serenity's that good.I could talk about the universe, or the characters, but what makes Serenity so fantastic is good old movie craftsmanship.  The cinematography is amazing, the CGI work appropriate, the acting on target, and the writing intentionally different, different enough to let us know that Joss Whedon is winking as he tells his story, the story he never got to finish on network television.  And that's ironic, because I am not a Firefly fan.I liked the concept: cowboys in space.  The Chinese slang, the idea that planets are new frontiers, good guys that look like bad guys and vice versa...it was all there.  It was like a retelling of Han Solo's life, without any reference to the Force.But the show?  Didn't do it for me.  I'm not a fan of Joss Whedon's dialogue.  His characters sometimes adopt a Tarantino-esque patter that's too perfect, such that I feel like I'm watching puppets on the screen instead of real characters.There's no trace of that problem in Serenity.  In the first five minutes, Whedon changes realities not once but twice, keeping you guessing about when the film's narrative will abruptly shift direction for a third time.  And once you're engrossed, Serenity never lets go.The cast is richly used, no small feat when there's so many: Zoe (Gina Torres) and her pilot-husband Wash (Alan Tudyk), Jayne the thug (Adam Baldwin), cute-as-a-button Kaylee (Jewel Statie), and two new stragglers: the handsome Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and her sister River (Summer Glau).River is the primary focus of the film.  She is an escaped test subject and a super weapon in her own right, but it's the knowledge locked in her head that is so dangerous to the oppressive Alliance.  Thus, we have the coolest villain in awhile--so cool he could be straight from Equilibrium, and that's saying something--The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  The Operative believes in old style honor and the value of a dream.  And because The Operative believes, he is the most dangerous kind of enemy.  He commits some atrocious crimes and tears up the universe looking for River. And in doing so, he causes a desperate captain (Nathan Fillion as Mal) to return to his warrior roots with a vengeance.Important characters die.  Desperate plots are hatched.  Characters faced with by-the-book dilemmas react to them in uncharacteristic ways, surprising the audience and themselves with the outcome.  And yet we still get space battles, fisticuffs, swordfights, romance, and plenty of humor.Serenity is Whedon's masterpiece, but make no mistake: it's because the director knows his medium and knows it well.  It's in this tightly produced film, rather than the series, that the cast and Whedon finally gel to make the best damn science fiction film in recent years.	5.0	I tried to walk away, but Serenity wouldn't let me	2006-05-19	12	11	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3HFDPRMJ5EJM6	Michael Murray	"Any time a movie is made based on a television series, the production faces an additional dilemma: how to bring new viewers up to speed without boring series fans to tears. ""Serenity"" manages to do a fine job, those new to the Firefly saga quickly learn the essential backstory while hardcore fans are still entertained during the formative part of the film. This is no mean feat, given the size of the ensemble cast.The element that sets this movie apart from all the other tales of space and sci-fi on film is the acting. Taking the well-formed and interesting characters created by Whedon, the cast really makes them appealing and identifiable. You feel like you actually known these people and you understand their actions and emotions. Hopefully the surviving cast will have the opportunity to reprise their roles in a sequel or two or three.

The dialog was unique and witty that invites you to listen, really listen to what is and how it is being said.  The subtle facial expressions needed another whole script to put them in alignment.  I really enjoyed River's feet and the attention to show grace under pressure.  Joss captured the elegance and beauty of River's wanting to interact with the outside world on her terms.I had not seen the series on Fox but did catch an episode on its replay on Sci-Fi recently.  My first real exposure to the Firefly saga was this movie and I went out and bought the DVD series soon after to allow me to fill in the blanks.  A real shame to see the series pass on.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1HQGD6G6E5VOX	Michael Reeves	Serenity as a final chapter in the Firefly tv series does its best to fulfill the need to put closure on the tv series. As with many well-written sci-fi series, there isn't enough interest to maintain high viewer ratings which are used to determine if a series gets support or cancellation. Though I definitely enjoyed the original series, Firefly, the final chapter of the series with characters being killed lacked some of the essence and direction of the initial series.That said, it is still a good closure on the series, and offers a last opportunity to say good-bye to the characters of Firefly.	5.0	Firefly and Serenity: Sorely missed...	2012-12-05	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A18IZ5QX2PRB3C	Michael Stack	"Let me be perfectly clear about my point of view-- I'm one of the converted ""Firefly"" folks-- my brother gave me the DVD set of the TV series for Christmas the year before last and during one massive snowstorm where I couldn't go anywhere and had nothing to do, I threw on the pilot for heck of it and ended up totally hooked.Now odds are I was going to like ""Serenity"", but what amazed me is how MUCH I liked it-- I haven't seen a movie more than once since I was in college; I've saw Serenity five times.So what made me do this?  Quite simply, the movie was fantastic on a number of levels-- it's exciting, well paced, doesn't trade action for story (or character) development and vice versa.  The extended cast (nine actors returning from the TV show) wear their characters well, the story is captivating, the dialog is well scripted, and the movie feels great.  But perhaps most importantly, when it's sweet and romantic, it doesn't feel cliched, when it's comic, it doesn't feel forced, and when it's suspenseful, you wonder whether or not the entire cast is going to die.  This is something that's really hard to capture and was perhaps most impressive to me.I won't talk much to the plot, I'm sure others who review movies more often than I do will do better at it than I will-- the basics of the story is that Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew of a transport ship called Serenity take odd jobs, sometimes less than legal in a future where technology is too expensive for everyone to afford the best.  Along the way, they pick up two passengers who turn out to be fugitives.  By and large, the movie deals with the governments attempt to capture the two of them and their motivations as such.Since it doesn't come out for two months as of when I'm writing this review, I can't speak to the special features and commentary track.  I will update the review with that information when the time comes.  But suffice to say based soley on the movie, this one is well worth the investment.  Highly recommended."	5.0	The best SF movie in a long time.	2005-11-03	17	17	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3MQ877KQHWWEA	"Michael ""that guy who once did a thing in tha..."	"Granted, having seen the Firefly TV show first helps, but it is not necessary to enjoy this film. Smugglers at the edge of society find one of the crew is not what she seems, and are hunted by a government operative willing to do anything to achieve his goal. There is a scene where the government operative tells the captain of the smugglers, ""You cannot beat us."" And the reply of the captain is, ""Got no need to beat you. Just want to go my way."" That sums up the stances of the two sides perfectly. The one thing that disappoints me about this epic story is that it was squeezed into two hours. It needs a little more breathing room.The blu-ray edition is beautiful. The details are sharp and clear, just as one expects from blu-ray. The extras are fun. The cast commentary can be audio only or watched picture-in-picture style. There are deleted scenes, out-takes, and plenty of extras detailed elsewhere. The cast commentary is one of the most entertaining commentaries I've heard. The film out-takes are funny. The film is grand in scope and well executed. This is not a religious film, but it is a film about belief and love. There is a political aspect to the message of the film as well, but it does not beat the viewer about the head and shoulders. This is a movie made to be entertaining, not to convert anyone. Which is as it should be. The bottom line is, this movie and the extras are a lot of fun. Sit back, relax, and enjoy it."	5.0	Serenity is an excellent film	2011-08-11	1	1	0

Even die-hard SERENITY fans should expect something more from a feature film over a TV series but it just isn't there. Yes, there are a couple of slap-face kung fu scenes and breakfast-in-your-throat chase sequences but not enough to overcome the ""dead"" spaces where nothing seems to be happening except yak-yak, ho-hum Serenity crew meetings. The cast has visibly aged, which is to be expected, especially Mal and Shepherd.

My dream would be for the show to continue for another 4-5 seasons to complete the ongoing plot elements of the series, and develop the character relationships to their potential.  This didn't happen despite fan support, and I have stopped hoping.  That said, Serenity was the next best thing.  The movie is faster, darker, and made for a whole different audience.  I enjoyed the subtle overlaps and variations that made the movie stand alone.  It was more disturbing, graphic, violent, and fly by the seat of your pants exciting.  It is an entertaining blend of Western and Space adventures for folks with an open mind.  The movie answers many (but not all) remaining questions from the show, but allows room for future tales.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"Success is not without its fair share of pitfalls as perennial cult-favorite Joss Whedon knows all too well. Following the fruition of his horror/drama television series on the WB network, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and its eventual spin-off, Angel, Whedon set to work on a new drama for FOX entitled Firefly, a science-fiction series blended with a nostalgic western style to its storylines. The series however was doomed to fail from the very beginning. Although it did manage to successfully recruit a loyal fan base during its short run in the United States, a group which would more commonly be referred to later on as the Brown Coats, low ratings led executives at the FOX television network to cancel the show after only eleven episodes. Reasons for its early cancellation are attributed to its late-Friday evening timeslot, in which it was often preempted by sporting events, FOX's inability to properly promote the program as a character-based drama, and the airing of the series' episodes out of chronological order. Fans of the program quickly assembled the Firefly Immediate Assistance Campaign to revive the series, perhaps on another network, but were unable to do so. However, the remarkable profitability of the complete series' DVD sales prompted series creator Joss Whedon to team-up with Universal Pictures to spawn a full-length feature film based on the now-defunct series entitled Serenity in an effort to revive the once thought dead cult-classic.The story for Serenity is truly one of the most originative and flat-out awe-inspiring scripts to grace domestic movie theatres with its presence in the last few years, let alone this year. The dialogue is especially crisp and brilliantly crafted with each of the characters and their actions onscreen. At first glance the specific word usage would conceivably fall flat in regards to the demographic with which the feature film is aimed toward, this being young adults, but surprisingly it never once feels out of place or awkwardly constructed. Instead it flows genially throughout the picture. The one downside it has however is the amount of confusion the film may cause for those unfamiliar with the now-defunct television series, Firefly, which now appears in a DVD box set. This is not necessarily the fault of series creator Joss Whedon who took it upon himself to attempt the daunting task of having to balance within his own script - (a) a certain proportion of the viewing audience which needs to be brought up to date, at the very least minimally, on the individual character storylines and (b) appealing to the loyal following of Browncoats, the nickname given to fans of the short-lives series, without pissing off or demeaning either side off. That being said, it is not recommended that anyone unfamiliar with the series go into this film without at least some basic concept as to what the characters are all about. This would go so far as to suggest watching a few episodes of Firefly now playing on the Sci-Fi television network or renting the series on DVD and taking in a few episodes before viewing the movie.Many, if not all, of the recurring characters of the Firefly television series return to their respective role in the feature film adaptation. While their performances are pretty much the same as they were on the small screen, not a complaint in the least, each performer seems to take their role up a notch in the transition to the silver screen. Nathan Fillion is one of the major stars of the picture and the one likely to benefit the most from Serenity's critical acclaim. Comparisons to Star Wars' Han Solo are expected to be made toward Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds whose `shoot first, ask questions later' attitude often gets him over his head. Chiwetel Ejiofor is the perfect adversary to Captain Malcolm Reynolds, an avowed atheist, in the role of The Operative simply because unlike Reynolds he believes adamantly in what he is fighting for. Surprisingly he is not the villain audiences might expect. He is perfectly admirable, relinquishing his `sword' so to speak at the end when the cause he has fought valiantly for has been defeated. It is only his cause that is immoral but because he believes in it, again, unlike Reynolds, we have to respect him for it. And Summer Glau is wonderful in the role of River Tam. There are moments, in particular a scene in which the crew returns from a heist and she delivers the line, ""I swallowed a bug"", where she is perfectly adorable. Then you have scenes, especially near the end of the film, in which she able to show off her action skills. Hopefully she will have more opportunities to work in feature films thanks to this film.Overall, Serenity, whether it is viewed by certified Brown Coats or green horns, is an innovative motion-picture event, a true rarity in a year overflowing with lifeless big-budget action flicks and extraneous sequels, with something for nearly everyone, from breathtaking special effects and solid performances to splashes of well-timed dark humor and inspiration religious message every audience member no matter what their religious affiliation can take to heart. Series creator and film director Joss Whedon, a man quite familiar with using theological subtexts within his works, designed Serenity specifically as a means in which to answer the question his now-defunct science-fiction series attempted to ask. The driving force behind the power of belief is that we as human beings conceptualize of a greater power in the universe, greater then ourselves, which controls every aspect of our lives down to our very actions. We however still retain the ability to decide for ourselves whether we should follow the right or the wrong path in life and the level at which we are willing, or unwilling, to give up a part of ourselves to a higher purpose in life will help us in making that decision. Serenity does not pull for one particular faith over another. Although Shepard Book is Christian, audiences would only know of this if they were to watch the television series. However, atheism, a concept to which Captain Malcolm Reynolds applies himself toward for a majority of the picture, is strongly condemned in the film. Mal has a moral code but because he does not belief in anything, let alone God, he can not comprehend what it fully means. This causes him to do stupid thing and risk the safety of his crew as he does. According to Serenity, it does not matter what religion we affiliate ourselves with as long as we believe in something. It may be a tad nave to say the least but, on the other hand, it isn't preachy with its message which is often hard to find, especially in Hollywood. The Joss Whedon helmed picture does have other things besides a motivating message going for it. As low-budget as this action adventure is, roughly thirty-nine million dollars according to studio estimates, the special effects, in particular the stunning aerial acrobatic chase sequence near the end of the film, are positively stunning. Furthermore, Serenity's musical score, a wonderful blending of nostalgic western ballads and mysterious futuristic accompaniments, is brilliantly composed by David Newman. Serenity benefits substantially from a brilliantly witty and charming script from series creator Joss Whedon. Its effective combination of humor, action, and heart make it a must see for any fan of science-fiction, whether they be Trekies or Jedis in training, or movies in general."	4.0	The Moose Hole - Pure 'Serenity'	2005-12-25	13	12	1

Simon Tam, played by Sean Maher rescues his sister River Tam, played by Summer Glau because their doing experiments on her, putting things in her head, images. Their picked up by Serenity, and the crew consists of Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, played by the always fantastic Nathan Fillion (Tv's Buffy, Water's Edge) and he is superb here, the pilot Wash, played by funny man Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball, 28 Days) and his wife Zoey, played by Gina Torres (Tv's Angel, Matrix Revolutions). Tough and Ready To Rumble Jayne, played by a kooky Adam Baldwin (Tv's Angel, Independence Day). Kaylee Frye, played by the adorable Jewel Staite who's an engineer and knows a lot about ships and how to fix them and who also is in love with Doctor Simon Tam. They rob a vault in one town on a planet and wind up being chased down by the Reavers, crazy as hell dudes who pillage and kill people just for the hell of it and their ships consist of human bones and blood. The Operative, played by a calm, cool and wicked Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers, Dirty Pretty Things), wants to kill River Tam because within her lies a secret they want to bury. The crew find out that River Tam can get a little bit on the violent side as she is triggered. Later, the gang find out the secret of the  world ""Miranda"", a small planet with Reavers inhabiting it's orbit and they find that everyone on the planet it dead because whoever it was wanted everyone to get along but it went array and some of the people turned mean, raged, hence why there are The Reavers. So, the gang go to Mr. Universe, played by David Krumholtz (Tv's Numbers) in an amusing role to try to spread the word on what the alliance did to Miranda and what the outcome came...that's if they make it in time, and alive. Fast, lean, awesome....even better then Firefly, filled with that great Joss Whedon touch of humor, action, romance and drama. One of the best movies of the year so far, by far greater then, yes I  am saying this and I mean it, Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith....so long George Lucas..who cares if your movie made millions of dollars at the box office, Serenity is here to stay and hopefully Joss Whedon gets to do more of this down the line..say and Angel movie or something or a new Buffy movie....the first one wasnt that great...let's hope.

My patience paid off.For someone like myself who is a Science Fiction fan, I was awestruck at how well made ""Serenity"" is!What I also liked is that Joss Whedon wrote the script so that seeing the T.V. show is not mandatory in order to see the movie.This flick certainly ranks up there with the Star Wars series in my book. Solid acting, good chemistry between the cast, great story line, excellent special effects and nail-biting action scenes.In this film, we get to see a little bit more about how and why River is the way she is and find out the origin of the Reavers.In a way, I was glad about what happened to the Operative but disappointed by what happened to 2 of the original Serenity crewmembers.The movie is so good, you will come to care about the Serenity crew, laugh and possibly cry at the situations they are in too. You pull for the Serenity crew throughout the entire film.These guys are the outcasts. The people others tend to ignore on the streets trying to make a living. This is their story showing the good and bad times I think we can all associate with.I plan on seeing this movie again, will buy it when it comes out on DVD and hope sequels are in the works.Well made movies like this deserve a second viewing.I hope the release of ""Serenity"" means that Hollywood will be releasing films emphasizing real stories and characters rather than every tired, warmed over sequel, remake, and hack television drivel that was released during the summer.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	If you have not seen the series Firefly, you should do so before watching this.  When I first saw this in the theater I had not watched the tv series, so it did not make as much sense and the moments that were supposed to have the emotional impact just did not have as much of one.  Most people reading this will likely have already seen the series, but for those who have not, it was originally a show on Fox, that the network totally screwed over by airing episodes out of order and changing when it was aired so it could never gain a foothold.  Then it was cancelled basically without warning.The movie basically wraps up the series to show us where the story would have ultimately gone.  We start by seeing River broken out of the facility she was in, and ultimately find out what she knew and what was causing her mental instability.  From the outset her character does a lot more than she had in the series up to that point, and Summer Glau does a great job with it.Like pretty much all of Joss Whedon's TV shows and movies, this blends action, comedy and drama.  There are funny moments within tense moments (that are even funnier if you have the background from the series), and the acting and writing are both top notch.  The movie on its own is very good, the movie after having watched the series in the order the series was meant to be seen is awesome. For what it was trying to do (tell the entire story of what could have been spread out over multiple TV seasons in two hours), the movie accomplished that very well.  It is unfortunate that this and the series are all we are ever likely to have of this story.  It will forever be relegated to cult classic status, but if you give it a chance you will be glad you did.	5.0	I aim to misbehave	2012-12-30	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1P7AGWW47FA7Q	Mikhail Lewis	"Continuing Firefly, or rather crash landing it to a reasonable conclusion, Serenity continues Firefly's Wild-West without-Indians in-space adventure so  as to more than satisfy fans of the show, which I recommend watching first (it helps explain some of the emotions and interactions between characters in the film). Without having seen Firefly's one partial season the movie is still fascinating and informed viewers will enjoy the ""[uni]verse"" finally focusing on the possibly government mind-controlled River and the crews discovery of its cover-up and the downplay of the failed romance, and chemistry, between the Captian and Inara.In regards to the premise, a space western, if you where going to avoid this movie based on that, you're not reading this review anymore. In summary, the crew of the Firefly are much as Confederate veterans of the US civil war, having fought on the losing side and now witnessing exploitation at the hands of the new government worse than that they fought for or against. Though its missing the ""unpleasant slavery associations"" this seems a reasonable picture of the south and I would not worry, but the additional deletion of American Indian issues from the universe of Serenity is transforms the final message of the series and movie from the brilliant seemingly Foucault inspired insights Joss is capable of.One hopes Joss simply didn't realize he was depicting a racist's rosy-red vision of the south in which the North is the source of all bad and the only glory to be won is exploration and Indian killing. Perhaps the the mysterious ""ravers"" are not the Firefly/Serenity equivalent to Native Americans, as they are skin wearing soulless mass murderers who are the only danger along the ""Frontier"", and that Joss does not believe Indian people are ""beyond madness"".In my rosy-red vision the Reavers represent a portion of us each, each of us being oppressed by the US government, but some of have a harder time with it. Luckily, whatever Joss's intentions may have been he is rarely mistaken when it comes to individuals and characters and I have no complaint with the depiction of race within them. However, I still hope that before his next project Joss undertakes some research in Native American Studies and patches the spot of blaring ignorant Eurocentrism shown here and in the notorious ""Thanksgiving episode"" of Buffy. 4 STARS QUALITY. 5 STARS ENJOYABILITY."	5.0	Joss as historical reconstructionist in space	2008-02-29	5	0	5
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" is a worthy followup to the much-loved, short-lived series ""Firefly,"" as well as a valentine to the thousands of fans who refused to let the show die after the Fox Network canceled it in 2002. It is less a sequel than a continuation of the series, picking up the action several months after the events of the last episode. The crew of the Serenity finds itself in greater peril than ever, as an Alliance assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his storm troopers target River Tam (Summer Glau) for death.The main value of ""Serenity"" to fans--besides reuniting the cast and allowing a bigger budget for special effects--is in providing further crucial details about the story of River, what happened to her in Alliance custody, and why the Alliance wants her dead. Reviewers have reasonably debated whether ""Serenity"" works as a stand-alone movie; I don't think it does. You really need to know who these characters are, how they relate to each other, and the society in which they live to truly appreciate ""Serenity,"" which means you should probably have seen at least a few episodes of ""Firefly"" before you watch the movie.Whedon's writing is as sharp as ever, as are the performances of the ensemble cast. Whedon never shied away from sorrow and tragedy in ""Firefly,"" but ""Serenity"" frees him from the narritive necessities of a weekly series, allowing him (without giving away any plot points) to bring the tragedy closer to home. Personally, I wish he hadn't done that, though I salute his courage.The DVD includes a generous selection of deleted scenes and outtakes in the Bonus section, as well as Whedon's self-deprecating introduction to the movie and scenes from the appearance of Whedon and the ""Serenity"" cast at a ComicCon convention. It is touching and heartening to see them engulfed by the love of their fans. They deserve it, every one."	4.0	"A worthy big-screen followup to ""Firefly."""	2013-02-28	0	0	0

After watching the amazing TV series and being baffled as to how the heck it could have been canceled, I watched the movie, Serenity, and it did not at all disappoint.  The characters and dialogue are the heart of this movie, and you really care what happens.  I was satisfied with the River story as that was the burning question after the series.

All the nay sayers might as well make peace with their dear and fluffy Lord, cuz the script, the premise and actors made for the part don't get any better.  You all came to this page for different reasons, and I am going to ask more from you than maybe what you came for.  When you can't walk anymore, you crawl....and when you can't do that, you find someone to carry you....and if you can't do something smart, do something right.  Everyone who came here is passionate about Firefly and/or Serenity, in one way or t'other, so I am asking you to use your voice, email, snail mail and any other venue or ear and eye available to you to NOT let Serenity be the conclusion of Firefly -- on the small screen or the big screen, don't much matter.  Whether you think Firefly/Serenity is genius and all things good, or if you think it's a compromise or that it's been pillaged -- you all watched with interest (purchasing is better).  If you love it, there will be more for you to love.  If you didn't, you watched with hope anyway and the continuation of the series or the movie can keep that hope alive.....where Joss actually gets the freedom and money he deserves to do this Verse the justice it deserves.So call, write, email and simply badger the bibbledy out of NBC (who owns Universal & Sci-Fi network), ABC, CBS, the CW, USA, TNT...and let's not forget the big Cable pillars - Showtime & HBO.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A25AXWGBGJ5KBS	"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo"""	"""Serenity"" works on so many levels, and fails on so few, it's a shame the public didn't absolutely fall in love with Joss Whedon's wholly original yet comfortably derivative universe.Comparisons to ""Star Wars"" are valid, in that George Lucas took several, infinitely familiar themes, scenarios and characters, and combined them into a creation clearly his own.That's what you get here.The argument whether or not you need to see the TV series before is moot: if you haven't yet seen it, you will desperately want to after seeing this movie.The characters are simply a delight to watch interact with each other. Nathan Fillion, as the leader of the band, Mal Reynolds, is one of the great, recent heroes of filmdom. He's got the gravitas, the humor, the physicality...he's the real deal. The supporting cast is so good, you wish the movie was longer, but THAT'S why you'll go back to the DVD box of the TV show. You will love spending more time with these guys......yes, most of them (in this film) are carefully drawn with a few lines and scenes; they don't have the depth they displayed during the series...but they CAN'T in under two hours. Believe me...the actress playing Inora ""the companion"" (Morena Baccarin)is one of the most startlingly beautiful actresses I've ever seen. She's given a criminally small amount of screen time and should have been a bigger part of this film. Just because I wanted to see more of her. The brief scenes between her and Fillion just beg for more time...Much has been made about some of the tragedy being less significant if you haven't seen the preceding TV series. I wouldn't make too much about that point. Again, comparing this to ""Star Wars"", the death of Obi-Wan has more resonance now than it did when only the first film existed, but it still worked in that first film.But I'm being selfish...Whedon's film serves the story, and serves it well. He also tidies up many of the over-arching plot themes from the TV show, but not so much that he doesn't leave us begging for more. That's quite the high-wire, tightrope balancing act.The sinister Alliance, the impossibly nightmarish Reavers and that relentless, sword-carrying automaton combine to form a genuinely terrifying set of ""bad guys"".The action scenes are marvelous. There are fights and stunts that, by necessity, you've seen before (the cinematic Rolodex inside your head will start clicking off recollections of ""Aliens"", ""Raiders""...), and then they tweak them in ways you would have never imagined.The chase scenes in space are breathtaking. I loved the punctuating silences as opposed to the expected bombastic whooshes and crashes.The terrestrial hovercraft chase is a model of how things like this should be done.The ""airplane crash"" scene is a pleasant torture to sit through.There are small things, like Fillion's makeup near the end of the film. that add enormously to the movie. He looks like he got the crap beat out of him. Not because there were huge welts and dramatic bruises and blood-spattered clothing. It was all artful makeup and one disturbing contact lens. And of course, some phenomenal acting...There's one short scene, where one character says nothing but ""yes"" over and over again, and another character says ""no"" in response, as both are staring out a windshield. We as the audience do not have to see what's going on, to completely understand what exactly is happening out that window. It's a brilliant bit of writing and acting.A few pointers for those new to the Firefly Universe.Yes, they occasionally lapse into untranslated Chinese. English and Chinese are the two dominant languages in the future, and believe me, what they say needs no translation.Yes, they use a combination of old-fashioned weapons (six-guns) and sci-fi ""ray guns"", but it all works.Yes, a lot of this looks like the old West, but the frontier of a ""terraformed"" system of planets may look exactly like that.There's really not a weak moment in the film. This is the first film in a long time where I had an all-consuming desire to watch it again. Right away.This is a most impressive creation by Joss Whedon, and it would truly be a shame if this were to be the last we ever see of the Serenity crew."	5.0	It would truly be a shame if this were to be the last we ever see of the Serenity crew.	2005-12-28	21	20	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ADFLBRY00Y70G	M. Lohrke	as a recent convert to the joss whedon world, i probably should've watched the 'firefly' series before jumping into 'serenity.'  i might have a better understanding of the core characters and backstory, but that in no way prevented me from thoroughly enjoying 'serenity.'comparisons to other 'sci-fi' flicks are inevitable.  while i don't normally like to compare films to other films (i think books, movies and films should generally be judged on their own merits, not for what they aren't or what they're similar to), i think in this case the comparisons to star wars are pretty justified.  i think it's safe to say that 'serenity' is a superior film than any of the star wars prequels and here's why: whedon uses actual physical locations when shooting.  where lucas relied on antiseptic, cgi worlds, whedon's worlds are organic and real, and it gives the movie a lot more credibility.  these are 'real' places--not a green screen. the movie absolutely benefits from it.whedon is also great at directing his actors.  i watched 'serenity' a second time with whedon's commentary (he's a joy to listen to, by the way. he's full of self-effacing humor, wit, and warmth), and he talked about how he'd often reshoot scenes dozens of times until he had the take he wanted. i doubt lucas ever did more than one or two takes. the actors, for their part, are great. they're fully-fleshed, multi-dimensional, flawed, and heroic.  nathan fillion's 'mal' is the ideal gang-leader with sometimes questionable morals, but he does what he believes it right, and more often than not he is.  the crew (i don't know all their names yet) are fantastic in his or her own way.  zoe and wash's marriage is sweet, kaylee's crush on simon is sincere, jayne's machismo is stereotypical but believable, and inara, well, she's just hot. you can tell the actors love what they're doing and it makes you pull for them all the more.  the secret weapon of the cast is summer glau's 'river tam.' she's one heckuva an actress.  she's 100% convincing as the troubled prodigy holding a terrible secret.  in her fight scenes she's nothing short of a revelation.  glau's training as a dancer obviously benefits the character.  her scenes with her brother, simon, are devastating.  in the commentary whedon comments on how summer was nervous her dramatic scenes, but she pulled them off so effectively that she had the crew behind the camera in tears by the time she was finished.  i was in tears, too.  she's that good.  she does a beautiful job of balancing the her role as a human weapon and the holder of terrible secrets.  where her performance anything less than it was, 'serenity' would have been a significantly inferior film. (and to learn that the bulk summer's fight scene against the reavers was done essentially done in one take is incredible).finally, whedon's dialogue is almost second-to-none.  he injects a lot of geniune warmth and humor--something totally lost in the star wars prequels. each character, it seems, has a foil--someone to banter with--and whedon fully takes advantage of it.  the banter is great, witty, and just plain fun.  whedon's characters are so fully fleshed that we're able to see their different facets through whedon's dialogue.in all, 'serenity' is a great film, one i wish i had seen on the big screen. it really *is* a sci-fi western.  and it's great. i'm off to netflix to rent the 'firefly' series.  it's too bad 'firefly' didn't have a longer life.  i don't think 'serenity' faired to well at the box office, either.  i don't think anymore sequels are likely, but it'd be nice to see one some day.  thanks, joss & co.(it makes me sad to wonder what star wars would've been like in whedon's hands...but that's not meant to take anything away from 'serenity')	4.0	fine, fine film	2006-07-24	6	5	1

My husband is a huge Si-Fi fan and so I thought since I am a Castle (Nathan Fillion) fan I'd get this for some together time on the couch.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	APLE6OD8PAFA0	"Movie Lover ""Dalton"""	I DID NOT WATCH THE SERIES, but gave the movie a chance based on the reviews and preview.  I am so happy I gave this movie a chance.  The writing is excellent.  This is a science fiction movie which does not get hung up on fancy pants terminology.In a nutshell, in the future, you have the establishment (the alliance) and those that don't really fit in, the fugitives, outlaws, and former veterans of the losing side of the conflict.  Serenity tells a story about family (the crew); love (for people and for your ship); and for doing something right (which would spoil the movie).  In the end, you take an emotional ride with the crew of this ship.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good story, told well, by a talented group of lesser-known (by gifted) actors.	5.0	An intelligent movie - just happens to be set in future/space	2005-12-28	14	14	0

I do have to agree with some of the other people who reviewed this movie, the beginning was good, but the rest was terrible. I watched the first hour and fifteen minutes, and then i shut it off because I was about to cry on how dumb this movie was. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because there are millions of better movies out there. My friend is in love with this movie, and she wants sequals made. LISTEN DIRECTORS: THIS MOVIE WAS A PIECE OF TRASH, AND IF FOR SOME LUDACRIS REASON U DID MAKE SEQUALS, THEY WOULD BE JUST AS BAD, IF NOT WORSE, THAN THIS ONE!.

Which means I am COMPLETELY and utterly in love with the Firefly universe and everything in it, this movie included.  That said, I think I can still honestly say that I would still give this movie a 4 star rating were I to objectively rate it based simply on its entertainment value alone.As for the product itself, you can't go wrong unless you're looking for some special edition packaging or something.  It's got a blu-ray, DVD and comes with a digital download (only valid until 12/31 I think) so you can watch it on your tablet or whatever too.  And the price is great too.  If you don't already own this movie, get it, you know you want to.  If you haven't seen the movie, Please Please Please do yourself a favor and do so...  Rent it, borrow it or steal it if you have to.  And if you already own another version and you're looking at this review, well, you know you're already going to buy this one too just to tell Universal ""thanks"".  ;-)I own several versions of this DVD but not too recently stepped up to Blu-Ray and decided I needed a BR version as well.  Not sure if it's any different from any other BR versions out there but can say there were some fun additions over the DVD version including a picture-in-picture commentary which was kinda fun.  If you're a Browncoat then it's definitely worth the couple bucks to add this to your collection."	5.0	Wow, I LOVE this movie!	2012-11-26	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2AN5SVFKB3HV8	Mr. Andrew Pleydell	"At last the wait is over. ""Firefly"" fans the world over can look forward to the fun of revisiting their characters in their BIG screen incarnation, having many of their answers solved, and to more trademark Joss Whedon storytelling trickery alternately misleading or revealing various unexpected plot twists - and gags. It's all good fun. What's more, unlike most movie style sci-fi our (anti)heroes are given room to emote, develop and demonstrate real responses to the dangers that face them.I went with a couple of similar ""Firefly"" fanatics, like me eager to see how the story trail would be picked up. We all walked away feeling very satisfied. (I could swear that my  friend Bryant, sitting immediately to my right in the dark, shed a few tears - there were telltale sniffles.)For myself, I walked away feeling that Joss Whedon is a real gift to genre based story telling. He really knows how to milk the drama just enough for effect, when to get things moving and when (and how!) to remind us of the personal cost to our protagonists of the events into which they have been swept. I actually cared for these people, quite a feat when you consider that there are nine carefully deliniated central characters and assorted unsavoury people in whom to invest; the whole thing was so much more than eye candy - unlike the vast majority of space operas.Why not five stars? My other ""Firefly"" buddy Nathan and I in the car on the drive home felt that perhaps Whedon's real skills are best expressed in the more expansive format provided by series television - churlish really, when we were supremely lucky to get this much. (Not that we are not thankful!) But there's something... maybe a little too much exposition, though this was very cleverly done! (How does all this information come across to someone unfamiliar with the series?) I can't escape  the feeling that the revelations to which we were treated would have so much more effective in the TV series format. Can you imagine waiting breathlessly for next week's installment with a story like this one, built up deliberately over months of careful plotting and preparation?Is there the possibility of a new series? (Six shooters, sex and special efects - one can only dream!)Still, it's great entertainment, and I'll be in the cinemas again in the next few days to see it again.I predict sniffles."	4.0	Serenity - now!	2005-09-30	17	14	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A38QX8P4F7MKJ0	Mr. Dude Man	The most important moment for a hero, whether it comes in a comic book, a television series, a novel, or a movie, is when everyone realizes  that they're looking at a hero.  In Joss Whedon's film 'Serenity', he gives us such a moment, and it's the kind that inspires goosebumps, tingles, and lumps in the throat.Firefly fans already know the back stories, both that of the doomed TV series and that of the little band of smugglers aboard the flying chicken.  On paper, it all sounds like another science fiction franchise that should have faded into obscurity along with scores of others.  But Joss Whedon has a knack for storytelling, and if anyone could deliver a quality Sci-Fi product, he'd be your guy.  Some of the elements are right off the shelf (just reach in blindly and close your hand around a dozen or so), and the fugitive brother and sister hitching a ride with a smuggler on a goofy-looking space freighter and playing keep-away from an enormously powerful and evil intergalactic organization might sound a bit familiar, but the story is thoroughly engrossing.  Most of the characters seem quite aware that they're in a SciFi movie, but they make it fun instead of getting mired in the usual self-important drudgery.  Nathan Fillion and Jewel Staite, in particular, throw out the kind of cheeky, out-of-line humor that fans of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' will appreciate.  One area where science fiction has really succeeded over the years has been in giving us cool new villains, and here we get The Operative, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor as a gentleman with a Samurai sword and an icily pleasant demeanor, sort of the Miles Drentell of SciFi movie nemeses.  Summer Glau's work as River is emotionally devastating, miles from the wooden performances we've come to expect from the B-level talent often associated with science fiction.  She has helped create a haunting, original character who, understandably, has an adoring cult following.  Joss Whedon has a thing for female characters who seem fragile, seem to need the protection of those around them, then emerge as suprisingly strong and capable just when the others need, well, a hero.  When River's moment arrives, she is equal to the challenge.(All this is coming from someone who despises science fiction.  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars; that's more closely aligned with how good I think it is.  Most SciFi movies and TV series make the mistake of going all the way into outer space and years into the future so that they can tell a story that could have been told better in another genre.  The trappings of SciFi, with the aliens, gadgetry, and other techno-nonsense, usually seem like childish, unnecessary distractions from underdeveloped human elements.  With 'Serenity', Joss Whedon has a story that cannot be told in any other way, and his film is a success because he makes creative and effective use of the genre to serve his needs.  Well done, old boy.)	4.0	Another Slayer is born.	2005-11-06	15	13	2

At it's core it is really a Western, but the setting is in outer space and it has Zombie Slashers!  However, the real strength of the movie is in the script and characters.  Josh Whedon did a great job in assembling an ensemble and providing each one with a unique character that is both entertaining and believable as a person.Plotting and pacing is fantastic, although there are a few edits in the action sequences that are a bit confusing as to what exactly is going on, and a couple pivotal words of the dialogue is garbled to my damaged ears.

Then the Region 4 release came out packed with an extra disc and contained some of what are included in this release: The Extended Scenes, Take A Walk on Serenity, A Filmmaker's Journey and The Green Clan, but the Region 4 also included a Joss Whedon Q+A which was close to over an hour long. It didn't really add any new info to anyone steeped in the 'verse, but seeing Joss Whedon playing off an audience when you haven't in the flesh is a worthwhile special feature.So is this the definitive release? not quite, though almost, the Cast & Joss commentary will no doubt be the best special feature of the lot and having the River Tam Sessions finally in high quality dvd as well as the Sci-fi special make this a MUST buy, as in now, but personally i'd still love to see the Sydney Q+A on there too.If you don't yet own Serenity on dvd, buy this version but if you're really needing that Q+A, seek out the R4 as well, you need at least two copies of the dvd anyway, you don't want to hide the fact that you're a ""Browncoat"" do you?"	5.0	The (Almost) definitive release of Serenity.	2007-08-09	12	11	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AYBL30P5NXNZ4	"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a"""	Joss Whedon has taken a much beloved (at least once on DVD) TV series, and transposed the characters to the big screen in a story that does them justice and moves the characters on, while never seeming like an extended episode.For those uninitiated with the series Firefly, this is a self contained film which requires no knoledge of the series- the excellent commentary shows what lengths they went to, even at the expense of some of the characters stories, to make this a complete experience.  However, you will benefit greatly from watching the 15 episodes of Firefly before watching this.  After all, the chances are you will be so hooked you will only want to go back and watch them anyway.For those who love Firefly, this is a fitting continuation ( I can't bring myself to say conclusion, as I can't bear the thought that it would end here) answering some of the threads left hanging when the series so rudely ended.Nathan Fillion is captain of a small Firefly class ship - he is a disillusioned ex soldier from the losing side of a civil war, and now leads a life of petty crime, but always upholding his own values.. think of a Hans Solo for today.. He and his motley crew are sheltering a woman and her brother from the Alliance.  However, the secrets the woman holds turn out to bring the entire crew to face ultimate sacrifices and choices as to what is important to them.Some of the character arcs are surprising, but once over the surprise / shock, they are all fitting.  The effects, the photography, the music, all are satisfyingly big screen, while making us enjoy everything we loved on the small screen.Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau deserve to be go on to big things after these fine performances.. but I can't help hoping there is some contact somewhere that says they will do more adventures on Serenity!	4.0	So it CAN be done...	2007-02-04	2	2	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A22H99WIVLISVG	M. Salsbury	In a year of great science fiction disappointments (Star Wars:RotS, Hitchhiker's Guide) there has been one standout film. This is it. It's well written, well acted, and was well worth watching.The story centers around River Tam, a 17 year old girl with tremendous intelligence, physical prowess, and some psychic ability. She was freed from a government research facility by her brother, Simon, a medical doctor who gave up everything he had to do this.They've taken refuge on the cargo ship 'Serenity', which works on the fringes of the galaxy. The ship is a motley crew of anti-heroes led by Mal Reynolds, a veteran of the losing side recent civil war. They take an jobs they can, not always honest ones.The story begins when the government (called 'The Alliance') feels that it must retrieve River Tam at any cost because she may have read the minds of high officials when they observed her at the research facility. The send a man known only as the 'Operative' to retrieve her by any means necessary.I really enjoyed the movie. It has a lot of action, but unlike most science fiction movies, the action occurs in service of the plot instead of driving it. The film plays like many of Clint Eastwood's westrerns- the good guys aren't always good; the bad guys aren't totally evil.The actors work very well together and play their parts very well. The people who really stand out are Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Fillion plays Mal Reynolds, Serenity's Captain, and his performance reminds me a lot of Harrison Ford in Blade Runner. Mal is a conflicted hero. Part of him won't let go of the honor and sense of duty from his military service - while tries living a life of crime. You can see Mal's struggle in the writing, but Nathan does a great job bringing the conflict to life in his interactions with the crew. Nathan really makes Mal a believable character.Summer Glau plays River Tam. She really stands out for two reasons: she plays River very well; and she does a lot of her own stunt work. I think a lot of actors wouldn't resist the tendency to go over the top with River's mental illness, but Summer approaches the top without every truely going over. River evolves nicely during the movie from a young woman with no grasp on reality to a woman who's starting regain some grasp. The fight scenes involving River are extremely physical - they involve martial arts, weapons, and gymnastics. It's quite clear that Summer does most, if not all, of them.Chiwetel Ejiofor plays 'The Operative'. This is a role where many actors would've gone over the top. The Operative is a ruthless, efficient killer. Chiwetel makes him seem very charming, sophisticated, and intelligent. He really reminds me of some of the classic James Bond villains. It's almost impossible to hate this character and that's large due to the fine work of the actor.	5.0	Buy this gorram DVD!	2005-11-03	15	15	0

But, they really blew it on their marketing strategy (if you can call it that), so Serenity flew under most folk's radar when it hit theaters. If it had been advertised better, this movie would have made at least $200 mil. The DVD cover art fails to convey the plot- much like the cinema poster; but don't let that fool you. I highly, highly reccomend this flick. Pop a double batch of popcorn, sit back and watch two hours go by like 10 minutes. With plenty of shoot-em-up, kick-butt action; humor, sadness, and some scariness- Joss really delivers!	5.0	One of the Three Best Movies in '05!	2005-11-19	8	6	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AZV0ZRCDU5NK3	Mykl	This is how a sci-fi adventure should be. The lines are crisp, the action is great, the back-story helps establish the movie's environment, the CGI is effective and used wisely (meaning that we don't have old men doing back flips just to skip using the stairs and actors are not surrounded by awful CGI environments), and the acting is good for the kinda movie it is.What kinda of movie is it? FUN like Star Wars was, The Thing was, Body Snatchers was, and the countless other movies that helped establish the genre from the '50's and on. And just for note Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and it's series), Angel, and Fire Fly (which is the basis for this movie) also created Toy Story and yes wrote Alien Resurrection, which he still says what you saw on the screen WAS NOT what he wrote... my point they were FUN, this is TOO!This is where the future of the genre should go...

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1LE0N83C2XKMN	Mystery Maven	This film is classic Joss Whedon and will leave you breathless at the end as if you were in on the action. Whedon doesn't disappoint fans with high expectations, but also gives enough background so that newcomers aren't totally lost. I think, however, there's much more depth for viewers of the series or who have seen the reruns on SciFi channel. There just isn't enough time to cover the relationships in a two hour movie. But the series is just that good--if you haven't seen it before the movie, I'll guarantee you will afterwards.One departure Whedon takes from other sci-fi shows is the ship and scenes are much more realistic and believable. Serenity is a cargo ship and looks like one. It's functional and not all shiny and clean like on Star Trek. The colonized towns look more like the old west, except for the hovercraft and six shooters that fire lasers. There's definitely a western feel to things with a little Asian thrown in. Frequently, the crew is given to swear in a Mandarin-sounding language which is a sweet way to keep the ratings and yet be believable. Some of the cities and even the Serenity sport Asian decor and writing.I find it interesting the Whedon is allegedly agnostic because he slips in a lot of religious themes. There's first and foremost Shepard Book, the preacher with the mysterious past, played wonderfully by Ron Glass in the series and who has way too short a role in the film. (Oldsters will remember that Glass played a detective in the comedy Barney Miller.) Inara, a companion, is a Buddhist. And Mr. Universe, a pirate broadcaster, has a Jewish wedding with his robot companion. (I, Robot anyone?) Even The Operative (played chillingly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) has his own twisted creed.Another theme of the movie (without giving anything away) is the harm done when the government mettles. In the series, two genius siblings become passengers. Simon, a doctor, smuggles his sister, River, who has been used as a guinea pig by the universal government known as the Alliance. She is a psychic and they have tried to tap into her brain. This has left her unstable and possibly dangerous even to her friends. Simon gave up his budding career to save her and now the Alliance wants her back so they put The Operative on Serenity's trail.Serenity is a roller coaster in a movie theater--it catapults you along. You'll laugh (a lot!), you'll cry and yes, you'll cheer. This is also a thinking person's sci-fi movie and it will give you a lot to ponder later. One hopes Whedon can work the same magic he was able to with Buffy and resurrect this movie back into a series. SciFi channel, are you listening?	5.0	Forget Star Wars and Star Trek--this beats them all!	2005-10-08	3	2	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1BBT9XLKQDV81	"N8 ""Buffy is Queen!!"""	"I have loved Joss Whedon for over a third of my life. Since the first episode of Buffy I was completely hooked on the guy and his genius and I have not turned back. I had extremely high expectations for his theatrical directorial debut, and I am very happy to say that ""Serenity"" more than exceeded all my expectations.At first I must admit that I was skeptical at certain points. I loved ""Firefly"" and was more than overjoyed when the ""Firefly"" DVDs were released years ago so that I could watch them over and over and over. But I was skeptical as to how successfully Joss could introduce the characters and their ""verse"" to first timers while adding something new and relevant to the story for those of us who have enjoyed the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew for years now. Of course I should never have worried. I have seen this film multiple times with many different people who had never watched a second of ""Firefly"" yet completely fell in love with the story and the characters. There is a feeling of unity that Joss establishes with his casts and characters that no other writer/director/producer can even attempt to establish. Joss's cast and characters have a comaraderie about them that is uniquely Joss and uniquely fun. He did it with Buffy, he did it again with Angel, he did if for a third (and possibly most successful) time with Firefly, and he continues it with his work on Marvel Comics comic book, ""Astonishing X-Men."" There is a familial warmth that is undeniable, and it is part of what makes the film ""Serenity"" so spectacular.This movie is the kind of movie that one can truly watch over and over and over again. Every time I've seen it I have heard new lines that made me laugh outloud that I didn't notice before because I was already laughing so loud at something a character has said. The witty quips and dialogue of this movie are unparalleled in every other movie ever, with the possible exception of ""Army of Darkness."" Whether the humor is from Mal's muscle-man, Jayne, obvious funnyman, Wash, Mal himself, or any of the other brilliant characters, this movie is hilarious. In a very intelligent and surprising way. The humor just adds to the plot which took my breath away with its intricacies and perfection. Honestly, I cannot say enough good about this movie.Whether you are a fan of sci-fi, westerns, comedy, action, romance, or whatever, this movie is for you. It's brilliant. This is the movie George Lucas should have made. It's like early, awesome Han Solo only 8,000,000 times cooler than that could ever be because Joss has something George never had: heart. His heart and his intelligence bleed all over this film, and I truly hope that the DVD sales are astronomical so hopefully, sometime in the near future, Joss can take us back to his brilliant Serenity on yet another amazing tale.Of course, if you buy the full screen version, something amazingly gorgeous will get cut.  The visuals in this epic film are on par with films that cost literally hundreds more millions of dollars to make (ie all three Star Wars Prequels) so I say go all out and get widescreen to take in all the gorgeous beauty that is ""Serenity.""  But even in full screen format it's still worth every penny."	5.0	Movie of the Year	2005-11-07	6	4	2

I love the story and the universe Joss Whedon created; that being said, ""Serenity"" can be seen as a stand-alone movie (though I recommend starting with ""Firefly"").  All of the characters are really strong, there's a perfect balance of the serious with the humorous, and one thing I absolutely love is that the special effects are there to support the story and not put in as a tribute to themselves.  ""Serenity"" is a truly balanced movie; it's a space opera with Western themes; it's a comedy about a bunch of different people all traveling on the same starship; it's worth watching over and over again.  I would love Joss Whedon to make another movie or to make a new season featuring the ""Firefly"" cast; in a way, though, what he and the rest of the crew (including the actors) have accomplished is amazing and stands well on its own."	5.0	A Great Sci-Fi Movie	2011-05-18	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A38921VU3NJDFK	N. Anno	This exemplary continuation of the Fox television series Firefly proves that a TV-to-big screen transition is not always rough. Directed by Joss Whedon (who also directed the short-lived series), Serenity (which shares its name with the program's beloved ship) is a science-fiction action-comedy with a classic Western feel that delivers in each of its numerous genre categories, while simultaneously refreshing viewers with relatable characters and a convincing script. As was the case on the show, Nathan Fillion steals the spotlight as the goofy, yet legendary captain, Malcolm Reynolds. Malcolm and his crew venture through space, on the run from the governing Alliance, which seeks two of Reynolds' new passengers: Simon; and, more importantly, his sister, River, whose telepathy and mental and physical capacities pose as a threat against its reign.	4.0	Serenity (2005)	2010-02-17	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AKZXT6NZWHYDM	"Natalie ""Book Nerd"""	If you're looking for space opera ala Star Wars prequels, you probably won't care for Serenity or Firefly. There aren't lasers (the central characters are all poor, can't afford them), aliens, or elaborate costuming.However, the characters are much more three dimensional and real than the wooden prequel characters, no whiny selfcentered wifebeating cardboard props here. The main villian does what he does because he believes his actions are in society's best interests, not the same old desire to conquer the galaxy or whatever. The characters are distinct personalities, unlike the Star Wars prequels where, with the exception of Ewan McGregor & Liam Neeson, I really didn't relate to anyone as a person, let alone a character with motivations. If you have fond memories of Han and Leia bickering and pretending they don't care, if you miss Lando's banter, you'll get much closer to it here than in EpIII.There are some nuances that will be lost if you haven't seen Firefly, but that doesn't detract from the movie's enjoyability. I watched the movie without having seen the series first, Joss will fill you in on everything you need to know to enjoy the movie. It's definitely worth your time.	5.0	Great scifi	2005-12-22	15	13	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A25S3UAW9K33YV	Nate Baker	"The new special features are all great; I don't think that anyone ever doubted they would be.What I am always curious about when buying a special edition, however, is the new packaging. Taxi Driver came out last week with a great new collectors edition featuring a very nice, slim set with the perfect photos. The newest LOTR DVD's were all really sleek as well.The art for the Serenity Collectors Edition is great, but the packaging is a little bulky. I think that this is my only complaint, really. The DVD trays are much thicker than needed. It seems that Universal could have slimmed down case - they certainly wouldn't have to lose or crop any of the artwork.Getting to that - behind the paper sheet that displays the bonus info, on the ""real"" back cover of the set, is a great cast photo. It's basically the picture where you see the cast in the desert (which was, I think, the international poster for the film). It has been modified to include The Operative.Under the clear disc trays are photos of the cast. The actual discs just say ""Serenity"" and look look a like from somewhere out in space.The coolest thing is that there is a clear piece of plastic on the front that has the photo of River, as well as the word ""Serenity"". When you open up the case, you are left seeing the picture of Mal and the ship.Overall, the material is a lot better than the previous release. Besides the bulkiness, this is a much better edition. On second thought - I suppose it'll be nice to have such a big case for Serenity on my shelf, to draw attention to it... Hmm..."	5.0	Almost perfect.	2007-08-21	6	6	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AGVWTYW0ULXHT	"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S..."	I was never a rabid fan of the TV series, but there is no denying it was much more entertaining and clever and than most of what happens on television, with the exception (perhaps) of a few HBO series and especially the other two series by Joss Whedon himself: Buffy and Angel.  It was a shame it didn't last long enough to let the stories and characters ease into the kind of maturity that allowed some of the later episodes of Angel and Buffy to reach a seamless combination of familiarity and innovation.  As far as I'm concerned, they finally reached that level in this film, which ties in nicely with the series by providing backstory that is only sketched in the episodes without significantly overlapping the material of the episodes.  In that way, the film works even if you were never a fan of the series -- though you do probably have to be the type of person that gets a kick out of (at least one of ...)westerns, space movies or kung fu flicks, you don't have to be a Trekkie or Star Wars geek (not that there's anything wrong with either of those!).The pre-credit sequence is probably the most innovative in terms of storytelling -- the film packs several layers of information about the universe we are in and the nature of two central characters into just a few minutes, and it is both enjoyable and intriguing.  After that, while the story itself is clever, it begins to feel a bit more like a conventional episode from the TV series (which is still more inventive and fun than most movies and tv), until the last twenty minutes or so when the story explodes into something much bigger than a TV episode and becomes, well, very obviously a very good movie.  Here's hoping there's more where this came from because Joss Whedon keeps getting better.	4.0	A great ride, well worth watching	2005-12-27	7	7	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A250AXLRBVYKB4	"Nathan Beauchamp ""ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at..."	"I watched this movie before seeing the television series Firefly, which despite being a huge sci-fi fan I somehow missed. I expected an average sci-fi epic with less than average visuals. What I got was probably my favorite science fiction film in a number of years. What makes this such an enjoyable film is that it doesn't take itself overly seriously. It has the same sort of unbridled enthusiasm for its subject matter that the original STAR WARS trilogy did back in their day. The plot is good, the acting good to great, and the visuals are remarkable for a film with the budget size of this one.The plot revolves around the crew of the cargo/smuggler ship Serenity and their adventures while protecting a renegade girl psychic and her older brother. Fleeing the totalitarian government known as The Alliance who had been experimenting on River, the crew of the Serenity take on a new level of risk, and are forced to decide between continuing to assist River, or turning her over to the authorities. Intermixed with the main plot are encounters with Reevers, space faring cannibals that terrorize human colonies. Eventually it is revealed that the Reevers, River, and the Alliance's interest in River are interrelated. As River is able to remember more and more of her past and the experiments she was subjected to, the truth emerges and sends the crew of the Serenity to the strangely empty colony world of Miranda which holds the key to the Alliance's undoing.The acting is very well done, beginning with Serenity's captain, a loose-cannon, military veteran named Mal Reynolds, immediately likable in the same sort of way as Han Solo. Played by the TV staple Nathan Fillion (LOST, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING ALONG BLOG), he is a very well crafted character who is at times honorable, others ruthless, and always entertaining.River, the psychic girl, is also very well cast. Played by Summer Glau, a relative unknown at the time (now starring in THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES), she is equal parts coolly efficient assassin, teenager haunted by frightening memories, and world-wise cynic. She is believable as all three, and captivating to watch whether wielding ad-hock weaponry ala Jason Bourne, or throwing out cleverly cryptic insults like the pregnant girl from Juno. There is an animal intensity to the way she plays River that is thrilling to watch.The other major rolls are filled admirably with another interesting performance turned in by the film's main antagonist who goes simply by The Operative. He is clever and intelligent, defying stereotypical enforcers from totalitarian regimes. ""This is a good death,"" he tells the man responsible for River's escape as he takes his last few breaths impaled on a sword. ""There is no shame in this."" He is able to convey a sort of moral depth that gives his character a level of gravitas few cinema villains ever achieve.While clich&eacute; is present in the film, it is kept at a minimum through two very interesting methods. The first is the use of Americanized western-style dialogue that is free from the more painful bits of sci-fi jargon. This provides the film with a 'culture' that is distinct as well as entertaining. It's a joy listening to the dialogue, and makes the movie worth watching more than a few times since you pick up on new things you might have missed the first time through. The other thing that helps Serenity stay fresh throughout is the remarkable level of detail in the art direction. The sets in the film are just believable, be they the interior of the ship, the colony worlds where Serenity lands, or the surface of the mysterious world Miranda. There is a grittiness to the ship, the weapons, and even the hand tools that shatters any disbelief.As in just about any film, there are the inevitable plot holes and mistakes. However these are largely irrelevant to the main story which moves along briskly, with the exception of a possibly unnecessary love interest complication for Serenity's captain. While not the most original plot line ever conceived, it is more than adequate to let the best elements of the film shine: interesting, multifaceted characters, terrifically good writing, and beautiful art design.A fantastic sci-fi film well worth owning. 4/5 stars."	4.0	One of the best sci-fi films in that last 10 years	2009-01-04	2	2	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3F8MALAQNVPRQ	"Nathaniel Ames ""Nathaniel A"""	"Much has been written, so I apologize for repeat observations here.Background wrt Firefly: I just don't know where I was when the initial Firefly series came out... I was watching one of the TV award shows, saw them get an award, but realized I had never heard of them. My loss as I love good Sci-Fi. When I was first told that it was a blend of ""kinda western, in the future, with some people referring to it as ""space opera"" I had reservations.  However the original Firefly series blended it all together with a marvelous tapestry and cohesiveness that seemed believable and very enjoyable. It was as much a story about future shock, large government control, and close bonds of interpersonal relationships closely woven into each story line, as it was about being entertaining sci-fi.Regarding Serenity: First, I disagree somewhat with people who think the movie stands entirely on its own. IMHO, I really think you need to see at least some, if not all, of the Firefly series first to fully enjoy Serenity. For one example, the movie opens with the operative from the parliament that rules the Alliance,  reviewing the rescue of River. It first appears to be a flashback in someone's mind, but it then quickly becomes clear that the rescue is a stored recording the agent is playing back for his own purposes. Against the backdrop of the Firefly series it all makes perfect sense. Without it, it is, IMO hard to make sense of.That said, the movie was well done, and I said ""close to marvelous"" because while I couldn't quite put my finger on why I didn't enjoy it as much as the Firefly series, I still enjoyed it enough to give it 4 stars.One big disappointment was that they never explained away just what Shepherd Book's past was really all about. At his end he said something like, ""And you'll never know.""  Another disappointment was I hated to see so many characters die. Maybe Josh was telling us that ""that's it"" and there won't be any more, but I hated to see the door shut on some of the characters I enjoyed so much and wanted to see a lot more of.  I also didn't like that Book's role was so minor to the Serenity film.In closing, I give it 4 Stars and recommend it highly, but strongly suggest you see Firefly first."	4.0	Close to Marvelous - Helps Wrap Up Incomplete Plotlines	2006-01-27	4	3	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	You've got to hand it to Joss Whedon. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator has taken his much beloved, and all too shortly lived, series Firefly and made it into something truly special on the big screen.  Serenity, like Firefly before it, is everything that science fiction should be and then some: loaded with ideas and a sense of wonder and awe.  And because it's from the mind of Joss Whedon, you can expect Serenity to be everything something from Whedon should be: smart, loaded with snappy dialogue, intricately plotted, and full of memorable characters.  Picking up where the series left off, Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and the crew of Serenity are soon on the run from the Alliance who are after the mysteriously deranged River (Summer Glau) because of what she knows.  And what she knows can, and will, change everything.  Everyone from the series is back, including Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Morena Baccarin, and the rest; as they all soon find themselves in over their heads.  The only downside of Serenity is that for a briskly paced film that's two full hours long, it's over all too quickly; but it ends with the hope that there's more in store for the crew of Serenity in the future (even though there have been reports from Whedon himself that no sequel or follow-ups have been planned at this time).  This new Collector's Edition DVD doesn't include the boat load of special features that one may think it might, but it offers some substancial material that die hard fans of the series and film will eat up regardless.  All in all, Serenity is an excellent film and one of the finest moments of sci-fi to appear in quite some time, and yes, it's so much better than anything lately to come out of a universe from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.	5.0	"""You can't take the sky from me..."""	2007-08-29	4	4	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AK9LN821QYQG9	Neal J. Wertanen	"""Serenity"" is at once a fitting ending AND a promising beginning.After creator Joss Whedon's beloved cult show (""Firefly"") was cancelled after an all too brief run in 2002, one had to wonder if this was yet another in a long line of GREAT shows that the Fox network didn't give a chance to, or quite understand (they played the episodes out of order because they felt the 2nd episode of the series was faster paced and more appealing) and cancelled far, far too early, while recycled crap remains on the network 7 nights a week.The network had to have realized a mistake had been made once the show came onto DVD and quickly became one of the better selling DVDs in history. However it happened, we can be glad Whedon was allowed his chance to (at the very least) wrap up no less than six dangling plot-lines at the shows cancellation.Fans spent years (or in my case four or five months after I bought the series on DVD after I saw the films first trailer and was blown away) waiting to see how things would turn out for fugitive/lab-rat River and her brother Simon who risked everything, including a successful and prominent life in medicine, to save River from the government who was hurting her.We wanted to know what was up with Inara leaving the crew, and why she and Captain Reynolds couldn't just admit they liked one another and get it on. What's with the Reavers? and how did they get that way? Would Jayne cause more problems and go back on his promise to Mal to remain loyal to him and the crew, or would he find another way to try and turn River and Simon in for cash? Why couldn't Simon return Kaylee's repeated advances?My only fear going into the film was that it would ignore the 14 episode series and play as a stand alone. I was thankfully dead wrong.The movie functions best to its target audience; the fans of ""Firefly"". A newcomer may still enjoy the movie very much, but would in all likely-hood be somewhat lost when the film takes time to wrap up the plot-lines I mentioned earlier. The best example is the small, but quite nice subplot in the movie that deals with Simon and Kaylee. It plays quite humorously and poignantly in and of itself, but has a bigger affect when you've earned that moment in the end when they end up together. In fact, I was somewhat surprised Kaylee ended up being the movie's most entertaining character.The biggest reason to see and enjoy the show before watching the movie is newcomers didn't seem to get why it mattered so much when certain people were killed off in the movie, and basically didn't care (I know this after a few friends and co-workers saw the movie, haven't not seen the series, and expressed as much to me afterward). So, as a result, a lot of the movie's final act is lost on them. I won't divulge which 2 major characters pass on during the movie, but I will say that the first was more or less expected because of the way the film was set up. However, the second death comes as a total shock.In the end, ""Serenity"" is a fantastic sci-fi film with great effects and action. The witty, yet smart dialogue of Whedon is again a trademark of the film like the series. Afterwards I felt like the movie had began a few weeks after the last episode of the show, and had wrapped up all the plotlines nicely. Basically, it was the kick-ass series finale the Fox network never allowed them to have. It also sets up some new dynamics within the crew, and leaves the door open for a promising film franchise.We can only hope, the studio is smarter than the network, and allows a sequel to occur."	5.0	Great end.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A19C8I3MT0G5OS	"Neko ""nekokyt"""	All I can say to those who are considering buying this movie, give it a chance. It will defintely surprise you. I have always been a fan of Joss Whedon, since the beginning of the Buffy Verse. When I heard about Firefly the Series, I was curious for several reasions. I knew it was going to be different from Whedon's huge successes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. I knew that it was by Joss Whedon, who is a genius in his own right. I knew I could expect witty, outrageous humor, I knew I could expect depth in the characters and story lines.I got everything I expected but what I did not expect was how deeply I would fall in love with the short lived series. It was nothing like Buffy or Angel, it was more. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge, dead hard fan of Buffy and Angel but Firefly is in a realm all its own.The characters are amazing, the stories... even more so.I was BEYOND excited for the release of the movie, FINALLY after the show was cancelled so hastily, was it coming back to the screen and the BIG screen no less.I went the day after opening day, I sat through the movie, smiling as wide as any other Browncoat out there. This movie was awesome.It is by far one of my favorite movies of the year. It had action, that witty humor we all love and depth in the story and with the characters. I laughed, I cried, I yelled (look behind you! type stuff), I was TOTALLY into this movie. I was beyond happy.I found my serenity in Serenity.... :)	5.0	Finding Serenity in Serenity	2005-12-14	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1IPZ3YSELMYB4	ne mo	Yes, this movie was pretty good.  The action is a little generic - particularly the sexy little girl warrior that kicks guys' butts and the heavy conspiracy government cover-up plot.  And the bad guys, alas, are basically rejects from Buffy.  But there's a reason Whedon is popular, he can certainly write, it's cool dialogue and action and his hero is someone Han Solo would hang out with.The movie IS fun, original, thought-provoking.  But the last is a problem - because Whedon can't seem to write his big ideas clearly, so I was left scratching my head aftewards wondering if he's religous, or anachist or liberal or what.  It's just. this. short. of making it's point clearly.  The fans obviously get it - read the other reviews.  And I suspect current college students are already immersed in Josh's culture enough to 'GET' it.The rest of us will have to be happy with the movie George Lucas should have given us years ago.  My personal preference is that Josh makes more movies like this, with a smidge more fun, a little more explanation, and a little more spit and polish - and help me forget Episode I-III.	4.0	Kind of an in-joke but still entertaining.	2006-01-03	7	4	3

I cannot convey the impact this movie, and it's predecessor television series Firefly, has had on how I view modern cinema.  The writing is FANTASTIC and the acting INCREDIBLE!  The suttle grittiness of humanity displayed on screen; something rarely seen outside of movies such as Raging Bull or any monologue given by Steve Buscemi. I just hope that this movie will show everyone just how special this show really was...and maybe allow us to experience more.  Please see the entire Firefly boxset prior to watching the movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3UXMIS80D9RJO	Nicholas D. Donner	I actually saw this movie before getting into the series, so I really didn't know what all the fuss was about.  After watching it I thought it was a pretty decent SciFi actioner with some pretty clever jokes thrown in.  It wasn't until I watched the series sometime afterward that I realized how much it meant to some of the people around me.  As much as that movie was created to appeal to a broad audience, you simply don't get as much out of it unless you have a pre-existing affection for that crew.  Once I had that and went back to watch the film for a second time, it became very bittersweet to me, and, thusly, more important.  Not because it was somehow a better movie, but because it was part of a greater whole.  If I had only one complaint, it would be that some of the more overt Western themes seem to have been stripped down a bit when compaired to the show.  That was always something that I liked about the show and I did miss it somewhat in the film.  The Western-film lingo is still thrown around in some of the dialogue, but on the whole it feels like it embraces it's SciFi elements a bit more; I assume, because the producers found SciFi to be a more bankable concept for today's cinema-goers.	4.0	A Great Sendoff.	2009-02-12	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1TX1HIEANNQFW	Nick Goodman	That is the best line I can think of to describe this film.  The crew of Serenity is back and up to their old tricks, unstoppable as ever.*Only one note for those who have not seen Firefly:  I suggest watching the series from beginning to end.  This is not because I feel the film will be confusing for you (the film sets up the 'Verse better than the series opener), but because once you've seen Serenity, you'll likely want to watch the series.  Being a later step in Whedon's timeline, Serenity will take some of the suspense out of Firefly, especially the first episode.*Irony.  Part of these characters' charm is their lack of heroic capability.  They do a lot with very little.  Yes, they do some incredible things, but they're still very small fish in an infinite pond.  The point is that even the most insignificant individuals can make substantial ripples.  They do the impossible, and that makes them mighty.	5.0	Nothing in the 'Verse Can Stop Me	2005-12-27	12	12	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3NX64C5IAPKUF	"Nick Mnemonic ""Nick"""	This was a great movie.  It was a wonderful, and masterfully executed, conclusion to one of the greatest TV series: Firefly.  The reason my title says bittersweet is because as nice as it was to get some closure to the story created with the series, it was also kind of sad to know that it WAS a conclusion.  That this was the end.  The movie &#8220;Serenity&#8221; stands on its own as a great movie, but if you haven&#8217;t watched the Firefly series, then I&#8217;d highly recommend it.  Not only for the simple fact that it&#8217;s an amazing show, but because it is actually the precursor to the movie.This movie asks what would be a &#8220;perfect&#8221; world, and would it be what you thought if you got it?  Would it be worth the price?  Would it be perfect if it was imposed and not chosen?  Sure, it may sound similar to other stories, but this one is presented in a pretty unique way, and the characters are unforgettable.  As a movie by itself, I probably wouldn&#8217;t praise it is highly as I do.  But as a continuation of Firefly, it&#8217;s &#8220;perfect&#8230;&#8221;	5.0	A very bittersweet ending to an amazing series.	2014-06-30	0	0	0

The case is nice, but they really want to suck your wallet empty by inserting a sales flier listing ""official Serenity"" merchandise you can order - that's all this version is about - bleeding you dry.

For those who do not know, Serenity takes the characters of Firefly and slightly rewrites their story to create this movie. It's a fantastic creation, full of witty dialogue, perfectly timed lines and action, and a fully developed cast that you somehow feel you already know. Perhaps one advantage of having come from a series is that the chemistry between the actors definitely shows, and it's obvious they know exactly who they are playing.Great film, and a good introduction to the (unfortunately) short-lived series.	5.0	Never having seen Firefly...	2006-06-25	14	10	4

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2O3KKU3N0MQCH	oion	I didn't expect to enjoy something that's Western + Asian + Scifi-flavored. I agree with the reviewers out there who say it can still be enjoyable without having seen the TV series, but people who watch that first (on reruns in SciFi or buy/rent, I guess) will definitely get a lot more out of it.The speech pattern may seem awkward, but it lends to the overall atmosphere. Serenity/Firefly is futuristic, but it's not. It's old-fashioned, but it's not. I wouldn't say there is a huge moralistic or political message in there, though people can always find one they (dis)agree with, and I think the overall message isn't terribly controversial anyway (the road to hell is paved with good intentions?). Some people may hate the Joss witticisms and one-liners, others will love them. It's hard to hit everyone's funny bone at the same time. But for people who don't care for that, the action sequences are good too; there's even some drama. And yes, it does have that feel of the very first Star Wars, though perhaps not as epic.The only issue I have with Serenity is the lack of a long version of the TV opening song (and generally not memorable soundtrack), and the issue I have with the overall franchise is the lack of Asian-descent people (talk about irony).	5.0	Fusion genre = Unexpected thrills	2005-12-20	15	13	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5	Olaf Johnson	The Serenity movie was a movie I saw  accidentally last September. One of those sunday afternoon when nothing is showing in the cinema that you either haven't seen already or you have no interest in seeing. Anyhow...Serenity got rave reviews and as a science fiction writer/publisher and lifetime fan I had to see what everyone was talking about. NOTE: I'll admit that I abhor and detest ALL COMMERCIAL/NON-SCIENCE Soap Opera/Sci-Fi fiction entertainment like Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Stargate and almost every movie/sitcom/garbage that has been ejected from the SciFi channel. I enjoy psychological sci-fi like the Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, etc... or hardcore Sci-fi like Space Odysey 2001, Aliens, Dark City, BladeRunner, 2046, I even enjoy comedies like the MST3000 series.But Serenity as a movie blew everything I'd seen before it away.This movie wedges a new genre into the sci-fi space opera type; Call it sci-fi western! It is well written, directed, acted and produced. If there is any gripes from the mindless masses is that the movie did not suffer from the guady overstaged over production of the StarWars sagas that movie goers today seem to suckle on as if poorly scripted battlefield scenes of non-developed characters and a go-nowhere plot is the sweet milk of artistic movie production.Serenity succeeds because it out does every recent Star Wars episode with far far far less. Five or Six main scrappy characters, chugging thru space on a ship that is the equivalent of 1970 beat up old Pinto at a 2005 Ferrari car show.At throw in some real plot, good acting, good-evil tension (in the very modern sense where everything is grey and not painted black and white like commercial sci-fi), a novel&working; concept of western drama meets intergalactic space and a good script and you got the awesome movie that is Serenity.Since then I've bought the FireFly dvds and discovered that Joss Wheadon and his amazing cast are very talented.Good stuff all the way thru.Get it.	5.0	Awesome DVD!!!

I am going to go into greater detail and gush my brains out when I write my review of the box set of the TV series, but suffice to say: Every positive/gushing review you are reading here is dead-on. Went and saw the movie Friday night, after allowing myself the privilege of seeing the TV series in its entirety on DVD (I didn't want to watch the movie not knowing its beginnings.) The movie, to borrow a time-worn cliche', was all that and a bag of chips. When I went to look in the newspaper Friday afternoon to see if it was still showing here in the Kansas City area, it was at ONE THEATRE, at a location quite a distance from where I live. Very worth the drive and the $$. I want to go see it again. Will more than likely own both the TV series and the movie on DVD very soon.The humor in the movie is more pronounced than in the TV series, which is a good thing--humor added to plots that are serious, when well done, is always a welcome thing. In watching the ""extras"" included in the TV series DVD, it is mentioned somewhere that they could not have found better actors to play the roles, and anyone with a modicum of intelligence would agree. It was like these 9 wonderful people were born to play these parts...to hear Nathan state categorically that this is ""the best job he's EVER had"" and to hear Ron say that he still gets ""teary-eyed"" at the thought of the series being over is both gratifying and heart-wrenching. Unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool cynic or someone with a heart of stone, you can't help but love these characters and the stories they get plunged into. If this movie was Joss Whedon's way of saying thank you to his hordes of Fireflies, then I guess all we can say is you're welcome, Joss. Let's hope we see a sequel, and that certain unexpected turns of events in the movie are brought to happier conclusions."	5.0	Glad there's no 12-Step group for this.....	2005-11-06	14	14	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A25LK8R2SUBNOG	Oxford42	"I have loved Firefly ever since the first episode. Joss Whedon expands the Firefly Universe in Serenity in the same way that his brilliantly unique series pushed the boundries of Television and Movies. This is a good sci-fi flick set in a world ruled by the ""Alliance"" (think the Imperials from Star Wars). The plot was well constructed, with a progressing storyline and characters who became more developed as the movie continued. The crew of Serenity, also the name of their ship, are an eccentric mix of people including war veterans, a priest, a mercenary,  a pilot, a mechanic, and a doctor and his strange sister who is being who are both wanted by the Alliance. When the crew learns of a secret Alliance project, they feel there is only one right thing to do, and at any cost. The genius that is Joss Whedon, created a thouroghly enjoyable movie that is watchable whether you are familiar with the show that spawned it or not."	5.0	Outstanding	2006-05-05	7	6	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A30IUH4AC21ISL	"Parrish A. Highley ""the_projectron"""	"My first encounter with Joss Whedon's amalgam of science fiction and the western genres came when a friend of mine channel surfed into the halfway point of this film and said, ""hey, let's watch this!"" Although he had not seen the film, he was already a fan of the ill-fated television series. I shrugged when I replied, ""Sure, why not?"" When the one character in particular met a particularly swift and unceremonious death my friend murmured, ""agh...now I know why some people didn't like this movie.""As someone who ONLY encountered the movie at that time, I thought the film pretty darn shiny. That said, there were so many storylines that Joss Whedon felt compelled to bring to some sort of resolution that I do wish this would have been approached as a trilogy rather than a one-off epic culmination of the television series. It's a shame the makers ofFirefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] basically got stabbed in the back by FOX, but the deaths of several of the key characters really painted this whole concept into a corner that it did not necessarily belong. If ever I could, I would resurrect this uniquely original concept into full-fledged trilogy that revisitsFirefly - The Complete Seriesin one definitive stroke!Again, I still really like the film and Nathan Fillion's portrayal of the reluctant hero who only wants to be left alone but is never, ever going to be left alone is one of the best of its ilk that I have ever seen. That the asset sought by the antagonist is not gold or silver, but the preservation of a terrible secret is equally compelling. And the very notion that no matter how much technology we invent, we must still tame the demons in each of our souls rings even more true with each subsequent technological advancement. Whedon came up with a damn good premise made even better by some shiny character development. If only there had been someone at FOX who understood the potential goldmine upon which they blindly sat!This is a film worthy of a good look on Blu-ray disc. The divide between fans who prefer the television series over the film is understandable considering the tone of the weekly show was very much space opera while the tone of the film is extremely tragic. It would be a little to odd to like one equally as the other, but I do recommend exploring both. While the video and audio quality of the Blu-ray disc of the film is impeccable, the series itself was filmed intentionally with a grainy look akin to a lot westerns. As such, you'll hit a point of diminishing returns with the Blu-ray of the series when those scenes appear.In the final analysis, I genuinely believe that the film is in every way superior to the short-lived, albeit brilliant, television series, but the film also establishes certain absolutes that I do wish could have been avoided.  If I had my way, I would write a trilogy that reconciles the best of the series into a worthy prequel to this film.  While the deaths of two my favorite members of the crew cast this work in a very tragic light, Whedon still tries to offer us a happy ending of sorts.  I would NOT have done that.  Once you take a walk down the dark side the way this film and something like Stanley Kubrick'sEyes Wide Shutdoes, there is no turning back.  A happy ending after that much tragedy is almost the worst thing you can do.  This is a great film for a lot of reasons, particularly when one considers the hurdles Whedon had to jump through just to make it happen, but after the horrible secret is revealed to all of mankind there are no consequences for that revelation.  Someone should have addressed that early on in the creative process, but it's a little late now.  Still, this is a very strong four star effort and one that I do recommend as much as the television series so long as all are aware of the tragic nature of this story."	4.0	Given the Source Material, This Should Have Been a Trilogy	2010-05-29	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A9F3I6L4N5TUX	Patrickbn	"Wow, what a debate in the review section.  Let's put it this way:  you'll think this is a five star movie if you loved Firefly (the now-canceled TV show that its creator called ""Stagecoach, set in space""), scifi in the campy style of the original Battlestar Galactica TV show and the Star Wars (Episode IV) and Blade Runner movies, or the concept of small-set ensemble acting.  You'll think this is a zero star movie if the only kind of acting/movies you like are bravura performances (Pacino in Scent of a Woman), unironic action (Rambo), true military (Saving Private Ryan), love stories, or Masterpiece Theatre, i.e., serious stuff.  Love it or hate it.  There's not a lot of room for a three star review here.""Firefly"" was a 12-show canceled TV project of Josh Whedon, the creator of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise.  Its central conceit is that humans are slowly colonizing the far reaches of the galaxy, but in a gritty and unromantic fashion -- there are no aliens or even extraterrestrial life of any kind, just barren planets that must be ""terraformed"" until they can support life, after which the refugees and poorest souls from existing planets colonize them.  Space travel is routine but still fairly dangerous, deep space scares the heck out of everyone, and the newly-habitable planets tend to be rough in a wild west sort of way.  Nobody but the central government has laser pistols or ship-to-ship weapons, so disputes are avoided or settled with guns.  Serenity is an older cargo ship (a Firefly-class ship, hence the name of the TV show) fitted for hauling and a little smuggling.  Adventures ensue when the crew stumbles into that old scifi chestnut:  a sinister plot by a well-funded cell in the central government, which wants to reduce everybody's freedom.What this movie really offers is a fresh take on the space movie -- no aliens!  no asteroids!  no giant plasma storm menacing the galaxy! -- and a cast of nine (ten, if you count the ship) who have been acting together for two years and show incredible timing and really, truly, act like they are the crew of a ship.  It's not too serious.  Funny and fast, but the tragic points are truly tragic.  Does it require a suspension of disbelief?  Of course.  Dummy, it's set in space.  But it fires on all its cylinders for what it's trying to do.I've read the reviews that compare this unfavorably to Blade Runner, etc.  Really?  When's the last time you saw those movies?  Blade Runner is slow, slow, slow, but it's still fun.  Don't get me started on Star Wars Episode IV -- I loved it, but that was a near comedy, packed with stuff that is just goofy:  the supposedly fearsome storm troopers can't hit anything (ever see them actually use those scopes on their laser rifles?) and never take cover in a firefight?  And why engage in an infantry battle when you own a star detroyer?  C'mon.  This Serenity movie fits perfectly in the genre of offbeat, smaller-budget scifi flicks.  But here's one last piece of advice:  get the full Firefly TV season on DVD.  You'll love it, and it will make this movie even better for you."	5.0	"Perfect for ""Firefly"" fans -- and for lovers of camp and moviecraft"	2005-12-30	8	8	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	"I don't think there has ever been a fan base of short-lived, but cult favorite, tv show that has ever been more determined to keep their favorite characters alive.  ""Firefly"" was a sci-fi series thatran for a few months on the Fox Network in 2002.  Fox clearly had little interest in the show as it was bounced around to different time slots, underpromoted, and eventually canceled with nearly half its episodes unaired (they were later aired the following summer as part of a 'burnoff').Fox's absolutely disinterest in the show was nearly criminal.  They should have passed and let it be picked up by another network, perhaps even the Sci-Fi (now SyFy) Channel, which ended up doing such a great job with ""Battlestar Galactica"".  Not content to be shoved aside by clueless network executives, the ""Firefly"" fans, nicknamed 'Browncoats' (after the apparel the rebellion wore in storyline pre-dating the tv series), fought long and hard, and succeeded in getting a full motion picture released, with all the main actors coming back to reprise their beloved characters.""Serenity"" takes place several months after the chronological conclusion of the television show.  Mal and his crew are still scrambling for any kind of smuggling jobs they can get to pay the bills, with work having become much more difficult since River Tam joined the crew, due to the Alliance fearing what she knows and putting pressure of Mal to turn her over.A smuggling job gets the crew dangerously close to the Reavers, a bastardized version of once-humans, who are this 'verse's version of zombies.  The events that follow put the crew (and River) back on the radar of the Alliance who send their vicious and merciless 'operative' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) on a mission to hunt down and capture River, while disposing of anyone who gets in his way.  Along the way, the secrets that Alliance has long struggled to keep hidden become known to Mal and his crew.  It is then a race against time (and the 'operative') to get that information out to the public.""Serenity"" shows what can be done with this this universe when given the proper production budget and resources.  Joss Whedon created a film that certainly ran neck and neck with other sci-fi films (like ""Revenge of the Sith""), in terms of action and intensity.It's a shame that it still did not get a big box-office return because that essentially negated a chance at any big-screen sequels.  However, the 'Browncoats' remain determined and I would not put it past them to get this show back on the air at some point."	4.0	I aim to misbehave	2013-06-10	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AARUYE130LY8W	"Paul D. Race ""Writer, Teacher, Songwriter, Ra..."	Firefly was more or less a western in space with the addition of a &#34;Foundation and Empire&#34;-sized backstory and deadly government conspiracies.  One thing that made the series work was the well-rounded, interesting characters.Unlike some shows with huge overarching plot arcs, EVERY episode had a real plot, and not the Lost-style meandering where nothing actually happens.  But Whedon WAS building toward a conclusion of sorts, and his overall plans were truncated when the series was cancelled so quickly that they didn't even have funding to write a &#34;wrap-up&#34; episode.  Fans demanded more, and a movie got produced.  As a Firefly fan, I enjoyed seeing a certain percentage of the &#34;plot arcs&#34; come to a satisfactory conclusion.  You see Malcom, who had &#34;lost his religion&#34; before the second scene of Episode 1 regaining a sense of purpose that overrides all other concerns.  At least part of the conspiracy that has unhinged River is exposed.  And the other characters &#34;rise to the occassion,&#34; even the mercenary Jayne, who hesitates to admit that they're all in over their heads.Still, it's far more than JUST a wrap-up two-hour episode of the series.  For one thing, it's a lot bigger.  Bigger emotionally, bigger in scope, and bigger in sheer size.If you like science fiction in general, you'll probably like this movie enough to go back and watch the series, then watch the series again.  If you liked Firefly, you'll love this movie.Paul Race - Faith and Fantasy	5.0	Works better if you've seen the series, but still great SCI FI	2013-04-04	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3DT9QNHRFPX2F	"Paul E. Lewin ""caermon"""	If you're as big a fan of the Serenity 'verse as I am, you will love this DVD, even if you already own the original.  If you don't know what I'm talking about then you need to buy this DVD as well as the complete Firefly series as soon as possible.Of course, I knew what to expect when buying this DVD.  There really isn't anything added to the film itself, but there are more extras on this 2 disc set.  The River Tam sesssions alone are worth the price of admission, in my opinion.  Also included are the Sci-Fi special and more with the cast and crew.The packaging is excellent and the exclusive mail in offers for DVD buyers make it extra special for us die hard fans.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I think there is still more that could be added to this.  Anyone who loves Serenity as I do would practically kill for more material about our favorite freighter, it's crew, and the people who bring them to life.For those who haven't seen the flick, you need to if you're a fan of intelligent, well crafted sci-fi.  The universe is well put together with no flaws that I could see and the characters are real people created by one of the industries best writers and brought to life by a dynamite cast.If you're idea of great sci-fi is Star Wars and Independance Day, then you need to watch this movie to see what is well and truly good in science fiction.Until Jar-Jar gets his own talk show, be cool.Caermon	5.0	For True Browncoats	2007-10-04	2	2	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1FQZQ4N1NQY84	"Paul Evans ""Paule"""	Serenity, the movie title, illustrates not only the name of the ship in which the main characters reside, it also expresses the overall theme to what makes the characters and story work.To be successful, you must keep your head and find your inner serenity. The rebels that live on Serenity do just that, each in there own way, and thus, in the end, are successful in saving the woman secretly trained to be a secret weapon and, ultimately, exposing the forced Manchurian Candidate-type training that is being done to the gifted children of the universe.The crew of Serenity are members of the rebel army, the rebel army that has lost the intergalactic war and are now homeless losers and potentially war criminals (depending on what world you are on).The Captain, who holds everyone's spirit together, is having a hard time of it himself when he finds out the woman and her brother that he is transporting have a big secret: the woman is a secretly trained military weapon who has excaped from her training ground and is being hunted by the powers of control to bring her back to forced-training camp where she is tortured with mind control and manipulation. Her brother asks only that they drop them off, but the Captain and brother being close, help each other evade the authorities and find closure to their demons.Though not for small kids, this movie had very good pacing and beautiful spaceships, with a lot of funny one-liners and sassy wit.I'd recommend this movie to all for a night of spaceship chasing fun.	5.0	Entertaining for all.	2005-12-21	15	11	4

Wonderfully smart (and witty!) archetypal characters, a simple us-against-them story that evolves into something much larger, and expertly-scripted, unbearably tense action sequences smattered throughout.  Serenity is going to become one of those perfect lazy-Saturday toss-it-in-the-DVD-player and just relax kind of movies, perfect on the shelf alongside Raiders or Butch and Sundance.

I haven't had this much fun watching a film since the Star Wars original trilogy.Serenity has heart, humor, drama, wit, and a cast that you quickly grow to love and care about. Forget the eye-popping special effects that so many Sci-Fi films depend upon to keep the audience's attention and the story from falling flat, Serenity is all about narrative and characters - and it does a stellar job at both.Even if you aren't a fan of the Firefly TV series, Serenity will give you some insight as to why people are.Dear Buddha.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A23M2D8GZPCWCV	P. Carhart III	I fell in love with the Firefly series a ways back when my friend introduced it to me.  It's basically a live version of the classic anime Cowboy Bebop.  The season was woefully cancelled after a mere 14 episodes.  There was an outcry from the world, and thus this movie was born.  They manage to use all of the original caste in this movie, and they are themselves as they left off in the series.Would I like this movie if I wasn't into the series?  I'm not sure I would.  I don't think I'd get it, and I don't think I'd care about the characters quite as much.  This was made to please an already established fan base.  They skillfully answered a bunch of questions that had been left unanswered about the back story of the Firefly universe.  It was perhaps slightly rushed, but hey, there was initially supposed to be several more episodes to flesh it all out.River kicking butt is hands down the most crowd-pleasing aspect of this movie.  Overall, an excellent movie if you're already a fan of the series.	5.0	I loved this movie.	2013-09-19	1	1	0

Great special effects!  Awesome, seamless music score almost on par with John Williams Star Wars score (but lacking that AWESOME main title theme!), as it ADDS and compliments the mood of the film.  You may think I'm being far fetched in daring to compare this to STAR WARS, but SERENITY is THAT good!The dry, wry humor is also great--just enough to ease the tension at just the right time!  Not marred by any goofy muppet ""aliens"", either.  Completely plausible story line.

Because after watching Firefly and falling in LOVE, this movie was just much more of that. The characters are all great, and it delivers a satisfying resolution. I like Joss Whedon's The Avengers as much as the next guy, but obviously this is his masterpiece. Included with Firefly, it just sings.I'm not one to really rate the technical aspects of bought movies. I turn to DVD talk for that reference. All that matters to me is the special features I end up watching, and the main attraction itself.

The quality is superior for a movie which is also superior and a great homage to the fan outcry regarding Firefly's untimely demise. The movie wraps up what would probably have been another two to three seasons worth of Firefly, but does so like a champ.One great feature here is you get both blu-ray and DVD, so if you cant play blu-rays, you need not fear.Somehow, i am feeling that anybody reading this has a high probability of being familiar with, if not an avid fan of the series, movie, and genre. So, i suppose i am most likely preaching to the choir, but on the off chance you dont know about this movie, watch it (but if you havent watched Firefly, you need to do so first.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3DZI9PS75ZSNX	Pez001	This is my first review here at Amazon, and technically, I view it as more of a response to some of the comments made about the film. First off, I'd like to say that I'm glad to see that no one is spoiling anything (at least in the reviews I read).One of the main criticisms I've seen on some other sites, is that one particular event (if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about) is 'unnecessary' or 'pointless'. I disagree. That scene was absolutely necessary--my own feeling was that it cast doubt over how the movie would turn out, but I'm sure we'll discover Joss's reasoning once the DVD comes out. Also, just because that scene happened, doesn't mean that there can't be any more Firefly. Things happen, people move on. It would be interesting to see how certain characters cope with the impact of it. And it serves as a reminder of just how good Whedon is at making you feel for what happens to the crew of Serenity.The other complaint I've seen, is that people feel the movie changed the tone of the show. I felt this is one of its stronger points. Relationships between people in close quarters change over time. All that time in a spaceship, stuck with the same walls, the same people--it's not going remain a paradise. I've had jobs, situations, etcetera, that I look back upon fondly, though by the time those situations were coming to a close, I felt glad to have them be over.The events in Serenity appear to happen some time after the final episode of Firefly, and a lot could happen in that time. The situation with River must have been slowly getting worse, as evidenced by the tension between Mal and Simon.In short, you can pine for the old days, where everyone was all happy and sarcastic, or you can realize that people don't stay the same. We all change over time.As for the review, I feel that this is one of the best movies-which-were-based-on-a-TV-show that I've ever seen. It's wonderfully written, excellently acted, and beautifully scored. If you haven't watched Firefly (the show which it's based on), I would heartily recommend it. However, you could probably still enjoy the movie without any prior knowledge of the series. Whereas the TV show left me wanting more, Serenity has placated me (until the DVD, that is). I wouldn't mind more from this universe, but I'm definitely happy with what we got.	5.0	A response to some of the reviews here	2005-10-03	13	11	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZZXRYGK8QMPH	P. Fine	What is the deal with the poor marketing behind Whedon's projects?? When the trailers for Serenity first started airing I wasn't interested at all. Much like when the TV series aired back in '02.  After reading nothing but good reviews for this movie, I took the plunge and LOVED it! Then I went back and watched the series.  This is a fantastic film (and series), better than any recent Star Wars in my opinion.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and watch the complete Firefly series FIRST. I promise you won't be disappointed with your investment in time. Serenity picks up where the last Firefly episode ended and should make the viewing of this film much more enjoyable as not *everything* is explained in the movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2HH25XER1C280	P. Gagliardi	"Every philosophy student should watch this movie!!  The characters can be seen as dialectic interlocutors representing different shades of morality.  This film is definitely among the more unique in our time.  It is as exciting as Indiana Jones, but is layered with deep philosophical complexities and moral ambiguities that many modern art house films don't even get quite right.As most people know, this film grew out of a short-lived series called Firefly, which, admittedly, I didn't know about before this film but have since watched in its entirety.  It is set in the future, in a post-war Reconstruction-esque Era where several worlds are run by the Alliance, a Sino-American, culturally fused mega-government that is, after all, just trying to make a better world.  The numerous system of worlds governed by the Alliance have forced them to spread their presence thin, leaving wiggle room for fringe settlers to live by their own laws (or lack thereof), similar to the American frontier era.Malcolm Reynolds is captain of the Serenity, a firefly class space vessel that is as iconic as the Millennium Falcon or the Black Pearl.  He fought for the browncoats, a resistance group who fought against the Alliance in the Unification War.  I'd coin the term ""vicarious schizophrenic"" just for Mal.  He's that complicated a character!  For the crew with which Mal has surrounded himself, I would make the argument, are a complex of Mal's many manifested personalities:Zoe - the Spartan who never diverts from her sense of purpose.Wash - the light-hearted adventurous pirate, filled with wanderlust.Kaylee - the suppressed inner child, innocent but adaptable and capable.Jayne - the churlish brigand, always calculating his advantages in any situation.Simon Tam - a man of moral purpose with a deep hatred for the Alliance, who abandoned a potentially comfortable life to resist the Alliance, who victimized his sister.River Tam - an otherwise gifted individual, twisted into something dark by the Alliance.Shepherd Book - warrior/preacher searching for cosmic purpose, who explores a realm where Mal himself won't venture, but who comes to teach Mal that belief doesn't necessarily have to involve something spiritual.Inara - a high class courtesan and Mal's soul mate, whom he petulantly alienates (implying Mal's self-hatred).The dialogue in this movie rivals some of the best I've ever seen on film.  It delves so deeply into the fabric of humanity and all of its moral dilemmas.  Here are a few examples (disclaimers: I did my best to be exact.  I've only seen this movie three times, so please forgive any inaccuracies):(my personal favorite!)Mal: Half of writing history is hiding the truth.(while experiencing a rough landing)Mal: Just get us on the ground!Wash: That part will happen pretty definitely!(before the payroll robbery)Mal: I don't plan on any shooting taking place on this job.Jayne: Yeah, but what you plan and what takes place ain't exactly been similar.(Simon protesting River's involvement in the payroll robbery)Simon: Do you understand what I've gone through to protect River from the Alliance?Mal: I do.  It's a fact we here have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves.Simon: Are you threatening me?Mal: I look out for me and mine. That don't include you unless I conjure it does.  Now you stuck a thorn in the Alliance's paw.  That tickles me a bit.  But it also means I have to step twice as fast to avoid them.  And that means turning down plenty of jobs.  Even honest ones.  Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to slip about at all.  This job goes south, there well may not be another.  So here is us, on the raggedy edge.  Don't push me, and I won't push you.(during the payroll robbery)Mal: I see a head rise, violence is going to ensue. Probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we're after here is not yours. So, let's have no undue fuss.(after rescuing Inara from the Operative)Inara: This isn't a war, Mal.  You came to that training house looking for a fight.Mal: I came looking for you.Inara: I just want to know who I'm dealing with.  I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.Mal: I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.(after realizing the Alliance is hunting River Tam)Shepherd: You have a plan?Mal: What, hiding ain't a plan?(Later in that conversation)Mal: I could've left her there.  I had an out.  Hell, I had every reason in the `verse to haul anchor.Shepherd: it's not your way, Mal.Mal: I have a way?  Is that better than having a plan?(before the story's climax)Mal: You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all come to the same place.  So now I'm asking more of you than I have before.  Sure as I know anything, I know this.  They will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.  A year from now.  Maybe ten.  They'll swing back to the belief that they can make people better.  And I do not hold to that.  So no more running.  I aim to misbehave.There are many, many more that I have omitted.  This story could be used as a study on human nature and a makeshift morality achieved through dialectic.  There is nobody here that is essentially good or essentially bad.  Instead evil is represented by the Alliance, which is really no more than a metaphor for how badly a seemingly benevolent ideology can be twisted.  A core belief held by the Alliance is that, as Mal stated, they can make people better, the opposing viewpoint being that humanity should be free from such intervention, no matter how bad it might get.  We have been seeing a similar struggle play out globally since the Cold War in the two forms of state governance that have dominated the world since then, and in our attempts to spread the ideals therein by force when deemed necessary.  Exactly who is right has not been determined, and I don't think ever will be.  Atrocities have been perpetrated by all sides.  Mankind will continue ever to find its moral equilibrium within the many shades between right and wrong, and struggles such as Mal's and the crew of Serenity will be those that punctuate the very essence of it all.  The story of Serenity always was and always will be the story of mankind, in its largeness and its smallness."	5.0	Joss Whedon: modern Plato?	2008-03-31	7	6	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A12JGKX638L840	"Phi Dong ""Phi"""	You know a movie was great when you sit there after it finishes and wish it were longer.  Serenity is that kind of movie.  I felt that there were some story plots that could have been further explored, but regardless, the movie kept me entertained throughout.. something that is difficult to find in alot of movies now.  This is definitely a DVD that I'm going to purchase.  Not because I have hope that DVD sales will help the series continue, but because I really did enjoy the movie and would watch it again.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AR9QFAQDN16Q2	Philip Hewett	Acting and direction are thin but special effects and continuity are good enough to keep the story moving along.  Falls between awful Starship Gallactica and juvenile early Star Wars movies.  Lead character is not much of an actor - have to be dozens who  would have brought much more to the screen.  Poor development of character for &#34;the ultimate weapon&#34;.  A waif Matrix type.  More i think about it the more problems i find with the movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2PKZMKAAI0OX4	Phillip Moss	I originally caught 5 minutes of the show when it briefly aired on FOX and thought it was boring.  When some much needed downtime came up I bought the series because so many people were saying how good it was.  They were right.  However, the movie was even better than the short-lived series.  Do yourself a favor and invest the 2 hours or so and watch this.  If you like sci-fi or just fun movies watch this.  In a world of remakes and lack or originality Serenity was a breath of frest air.	5.0	best underated movie of 05'	2006-02-05	6	4	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A15YZ4O6MH2O0W	P. Hooker	Before this movie came out, I had never heard of Firefly.  I watched the movie on the recomendation of a friend, and I didn't really see what the big deal was.  To me it looked like a big screen version of any number of recent sci-fi television series...OK, but nothing spectacular.  After even more prodding, my friend got me to watch his DVDs of the television series.Although never really getting the opportunity to fulfill its promise, the series had an interesting premise and likable enough characters to prompt me to give the movie another view.  The added character developement of the series improved this movie immensely for me.  It added an immeasurable degree of emotional depth to the story, and when when it was over I could finally see what all the fuss was about.Taken together, the series and film work nicely together to create what is perhaps the most compelling space opera in recent memory.  I look forward to future installments in this franchise be they on the big or small screen.My advice to you is to familiarize yourself with the series first.  While most people will tell you that it really isn't necessary to enjoy the film, the added context it provides is well worth the extra effort.	5.0	Tales of the newly converted.	2006-10-21	4	3	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3PVSNS17HCIXN	pizowell	What Joss did for Buffy: The Vampire Slayer - bringing a failed movie to the small screen - he has done with Serenity.  Only reversed.  But with the same outstanding level of achievement.Without diving into a rambling plot description that gives far too much away, Serenity is exactly what any Firefly or Whedon fan would want, and then some.  Love Firefly?  Then you'll wet your strides during Serenity.  All the fantastic elements that made that series and all of Whedon's TV endeavors so loved by fans are on full display here, only on a larger scale, with the antes severly upped.Here we finally learn the dark secret that River (the stunning Summer Glau) had carried with her throughout the series and are introduced to the mysterious Operative, the Alliance's number one agent, played with force by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  The final act of the movie is pure exhiliration.  Intense.  The underlying themes resonate.  Smart dialogue permeates. Conflicts abound.  There is a darkness and an adultness here.  Nary a cliche in sight.And fear not anyone who isn't familiar with the series.  Serenity wraps up the basics in the first two minutes of the film.  From there on in, it's prime Whedon.  Fun, fun, fun.  The signal marches on!The DVD includes insightful director commentary with Whedon, an introduction to the film by Whedon, deleted scenes and a fun gag reel.	5.0	Can't stop the signal...indeed	2006-02-13	9	8	1

(though I think the movie would do OK as a stand alone if you're just a HUGECastlefan and want to see Nathan in some of his early shows....he is also inBuffy]Serenity is like icing on the cake.  Sure, the series is gone forever, but they took the whole storyline and dumped all the rest of the backstory into one brilliant movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AWQA5OM2N8CJV	Plato	"Serenity is an excellent space adventure that hopefully will go down as a classic. Not only does it have an amazing action packed world that blends its own personality with bits of Star Trek and Star Wars, but the characters are rich and it's social commentary gives the film multiple layers.When I saw Serenity I had never seen an episode of Firefly, the TV show that the movie is based on. However, the film is made so that newbies like me can sit down and jump right into the story without leaving the viewer confused.The part of film that makes it truly interesting is that it's storyline is a reflection of events going on in the world today. With the ""civilized"" Alliance planets trying to impose their version of society on the Independents. Unfortunately Alliance meddling backfires on them (you'll have to watch the movie to find out how.) The film is clearly underlining western imperialism, and probably the unfolding events in the Middle East. However, if what you're really looking for is a cool space blow 'em up, chop 'em up, ask questions later, Serenity has plenty of that too."	5.0	Great Science Fiction	2005-12-30	16	15	1

The characters & their plights are continued from the too-soon canceled series. Granted, the story line runs thin at times and some of the characters seem a little overdone.

I hadn't even heard of Firefly when it first aired, but stumbled upon it and with all of the positive reviews, took a chance. I was not disappointed. I spent the next two days watching the entire series and on the third day, watched the film. This is quality writing; witty, well thought out and consistent. I cared about the characters deeply, which is the mark of not only excellent acting, but quality writing. I would highly recommend that potential viewers first watch the series, then complete their experience with the film. The blu-ray has excellent video and audio and the supplemental package is also worthwhile. As a stand-alone film, Serenity is very enjoyable and itself deserves a high recommendation.	5.0	Sci-fi at its best...	2013-09-24	2	2	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1H8A76J2BHTOD	Privateer	"Darn fine movie.  Well conceived and well wrought.  I didn't expect much going in, since I knew the project had a following and a modest budget - neither bodes particularly well.I like that the show addressed itself to the question of whether any entity ought to be ""improving"" people, will-they nill-they.  Drugging them up with new Ritalins and smothering them in false nicey-niceness, against their wills, under the pretense of ""helping"" them.  So the spine upon which the plot was grafted was strong.The plot was good, the characters and era were colorful and textured, some of that coming from the modified lingo being used - what one apparently challenged reviewer called ""pseudo-southern.""  Would it be more believable or fun if the brigands of the distant future employed perfect Connecticut english?  Don't think so.  There was a good and believable tension among the players, as though they had their individual agendas.  The special effects gave no indication that the production was not based on a huge budget.  (Maybe that means that all you really get with a BIG budget is a BIG-named star - I'd rather not have that.  Personally, I'm looking forward to the day when they're all computer-generated, players can go back to the small stage where they belong, and we'll no longer have to tolerate so many pompous, self-inflated celebrities.  That's just my view.  Where was I?)  The action was good action.My only criticism would be the success of the too-subtle mind, the preternatural anticipation Mal had for the next Alliance move.  If you guess that the Alliance has captured Mr. U's planet and so you bring the Reavers with you, you had better be right.In all though, the movie was pretty great.  I never saw Firefly, but am thinking about checking it out now."	5.0	Shiny	2006-06-11	7	5	2

The movie had too many changes to be similar enough to the series and it felt like they had to make it more mainstream to appeal to more audience, although I feel it wasn't good enough for people that didn't watch the series and it was too far off the series for people that did watch the series.Still, it's more of Firefly where it was shut down and I still love this show.The box was damaged when I received it unfortunately. The plastic thing in the middle that is supposed to hold the disc in place was broken off which caused the dvd to move inside the box while it was being shipped and this damaged the dvd to the point that it's not fluent anymore on my dvd player.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A16BZH9IALK4ZR	R A	This review is gonna get lost in the shuffle. Oh, well.This movie lived up to the hype. I got to see one of the early cuts in the theater before it was released. It had no music or credits. One of the special features on the DVD is Joss Weedon's preamble before those screenings. It's ridiculously funny. But then it's Joss; he's ridiculously funny.If you're a Firefly fan, you should love this. Even with what he does to the characters, the writing was superb and made the movie that much more dramatic.I've also got to say that if you're not a fan, you can still enjoy the movie and never see the series. I have friends who were introduced to Firefly through Serenity and have since bought their own copies. Everyone who has borrowed it from me has gotten their own.Weedon's ability to mix humor into very serious material is remarkable. He'll make you laugh, cry and clench  your fist in almost the same breath. It's a gift.The only real complaint I have about the film is that the FX in the chase scene with the hover craft and the Reaver ship, didn't look real. It was surprising for otherwise fantastic FX sequences.This is rambling, I know. Suffice it to say that you'll thoroughly enjoy this as a Sci-Fi movie. It's got all the classic parts. It rivals even Star Wars (OT) in my heart.	5.0	one of the best	2008-10-01	3	2	1

But a friend urged me to watch it by saying that it was an eerie prefiguration of the entire Edward Snowden/NSA situation. He was right. Like the X-FILES, this film does not paint a very flattering picture of a Military Industrial Complex run amuck. Although the humor and the PG-nature of the film suggests that its target audience is probably teenagers, its message is a pertinent one. Unfortunately, like most dystopian stories, its outlook is fairly bleak.

Any excuse to see the movie again is perfect with me, but seriously, the extras on the second disc made this a ""must have"" for my collection. If you, as I, feel that 13 episodes were simply not enough and you yearn for more information than those simple few can give you, than this is the perfect addition. The ""never before seen footage"" was a thrill; I truly enjoyed every overblown, choreographed, gaffed, giggled, serious and heartstrung moment. Also, a cute little flyer came in the box with mine for ""Ships Papers"", ""Alliance Money"" and a few other collector items for sale, for those who are truly dedicated to keeping the Firefly mystique alive. The box itself is quite a bit more hardy, and beautiful in a way, and its outer raised embossing is pleasing to the touch.

It contains graphic violence, but the darkest scenes are softened with well-placed, incredibly funny wry humor. The characters interact incredibly well, and even the bad guy is made to be understood by the viewer. My greatest disappointment with the DVD was the outake section of the menu.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1LRAVDYYM03WO	"Raymond Mccall ""film freak"""	I went with my two grown-up kids (18 and 21) to see this movie. None of us had seen the Firefly TV series, so we did not know what to expect. Within a few minutes of the start of the movie we were laughing harder than we had all year. We were delighted with the originality and humor of the film. It has the funniest dialogue I have heard in a long time. Kind of reminds me of Episodes IV and V of Star Wars in that respect. Very appealing collection of diverse characters. Very sad to see two of the most interesting characters killed off. But on the whole, this is very well-put-together film.After seeing the movie, we went out and rented, watched and then immediately bought the DVDs of the original series. The stories and special effects are not up to the level of quality of the film, but they are still excellent. Most importantly, we found ourselves becoming hard-core fans, and developing a real loyalty to the characters. Again, sad that two of the best characters were killed off in the movie; but that did not stop me from buying it and watching it repeatedly. Maybe the next movie can be a prequel, so the killed of characters would still be alive.I was staggered to see that such an excellent film did so badly at the box office -- especially when so many lame movies have done well. But I am very happy to see that the DVDs of Serenity and Firefly are doing really well in sales and rentals. Right now I and my kids are fervently hoping that sales are good enough for long enough to get a sequel made to this excellent movie -- or to bring the series back to TV.Check this movie out! And spread the word! It is up to us to make sure that originality and quality don't just get swept into the trash bin.	5.0	Funny, well-done movie	2006-01-08	16	14	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2XOV3ZKGDK55G	"RBSProds ""rbsprods"""	"Five Big Stars!!! Riffing off of the disastrous TV show ""Firefly"", Joss Whedon and the most unusual and persistent Cult in SciFi history ('the Browncoats') have kept the flame lit with superlative results: ""Serenity"". When Fox refused to let the TV show run it's episodes in sequence and terminated the show early in season one ""with extreme prejudice"", Joss stubbornly kept writing and kept the ensemble cast on call. The result is this beautiful piece of a SciFi movie that doesn't have one alien and no major star anywhere in it's universe.Ron ""Barney Miller"" Glass, Adam Baldwin, and David ""Numbers"" Krumholtz are the big names in this movie and they get less screen time than the others. As far as aliens are concerned, trust me, the Reavers, a carryover of really depraved nasty human guys from the TV show that strike fear in the hearts of anyone who hear their name, are enough evil badness for any Sci Fi Franchise. The Borg would flee from these guys! LOL. But Captain Mal and crew are also always fearful of the Alliance, the 'so-called' civilized central government. Packed with action, loaded with suspense, and with enough new characters to satisfy those of us who watched the TV show and bought the complete ""FireFly"" DVD set, this movie is a winner on many levels: originality, storyline, acting, cinematography, sound effects, and music. Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Strait, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, Ron Glass, Morena Baccarin, and Chiwetel Ejiofor scorch the screen as the principles in this 'cat and mouse' game with the surprise ending. Five HUGE Stars!!(Note: My original thought after the first weekend was that the FOX TV executives were laughing their heads off at the meek $15M boxoffice debut of ""Serenity"",  but Joss had already gotten over on them. They gave him all rights to the show and the ""Firefly"" DVD release soared to 500,000 sales. The movie kept going, thanks to the Browncoats and the new fans, until it 'broke even' at $39M. Joss then released the DVD of ""Serenity"" in time for Christmas sales, which will probably yield another 500,000 sales at least. Then there is the eventual release to HBO/Starz/etc, Network TV, and finally to TNT/ Sci Fi channel who will run it ""forever"". I can hear Joss modestly chuckling all the way out here in Texas.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1N0W0P2W56P19	"R. Chang ""mr_coldcutts"""	I'll preface by saying that I became a huge fan of the TV series Firefly and anxiously awaited the arrival of Serenity.  Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) created an amazing cinematic vision with Serenity.  Probably one of the most endearing things about the Firefly/Serenity story is that it is a science fiction story that does not rely on the typical sci-fi gimmicks.  The main emphasis of the story is on the relationship of the characters and not alien races, technological gadgets, or flashy special effects.The story follows Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) on a quest of his convictions.  Meanwhile his crew consists of a wonderfully talented and colorful group of actors and characters.  Among these is River Tam (Summer Glau), a refugee of the Big Brother-ish Alliance.  Due to various experiments by the Alliance, River is left rather mentally unstable and is trying to sort out the origins of her cryptic and confusing visions and voices while trying to keep her fellow crew safe from her psychosis.  In the meantime, an Alliance Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) seeks to capture River dead or alive.Watching the television series beforehand is not vital to understanding the story, but it will give the viewer added insight, understanding, and appreciation for several details of the movie.  The very human characters and actors create an intense and amazing chemistry, and the energy is definitely bouncing between them.  My only complaint about the movie is that due to its time restrictions, and a full exploration of the different characters is not afforded.  Having said that, my only complaint of the DVD is that a cast commentary as a bonus feature would have been absolutely wonderful, especially considering the chemistry between actors.  Oh well, perhaps on a future edition of the DVD.	5.0	sci-fi without the sci-fi cliches	2005-12-24	6	6	0

However, I had heard of it, and I WAS aware that the movie was set in the ""Firefly"" universe and featured the same characters.  Knowing that, many things could have complicated this movie for me, but not a single thing did.The trailers are what actually enticed me to see the movie.  While watching them, I didn't get the notion that Serenity was your average ""sci-fi"" movie, and it isn't.  Unlike many other sci-fi movies, it never goes out of it's way to say, ""Hey!  I'm a sci-fi movie!""  There are no aliens.  What it does have, that many other sci-fi movies lack, is heart -- humour, great dialogue, engauging characters -- which drives a great story.  And it's a story worth watching.  It's a fantastic film that features great action sequences, intriguing characters, air-tight pacing, and a gripping plot.  I still do not refer to it as ""sci-fi"", because ""sci-fi"" is rarely so fantastic.Also prior to seeing Serenity, I promised myself that if I enjoyed the movie, I would purchase the Firefly DVD set.  Around the 11 or 12 minute mark of the movie, I remember thinking to myself ""I am going to love this movie"" -- a reaction that was elicited by the introduction to the movie's central characters.  The next morning I found myself talking to the cashier at the local HMV.  As I handed him the Firefly DVD set, he asked me if I had seen Serenity yet.

The message regarding the dangers of an oppressive government and the power of freely available information was interesting as well.  After receiving the DVD off our Amazon Wish List and checking out the bonus material, I wasn't at all surprised to see that Joss Whedon was the mind behind the project and we were thrilled to learn that there was a related tv series called Firefly for which we have purchased the DVDs.

I was reading the various reviews but when I clicked on ""Read all reviews"", all I got was a white screen and the movie poster! What gives?  I wanted to see if anyone else caught the ""Forbidden Planet"" tribute. I had to explain it to my friends because I chuckled at a tense moment and they couldn't understand why. If you missed it, when the crew is on planet Miranda they enter the laboratory where they discover the terrible secret being hid by the Alliance. On the outside and on the walls of the lab (I'm uncertain if this was a building or a vessle) it is marked ""C57D"". This is the registration number of the star ship from ""Forbidden Planet"", which also is a double entendre (sorry if I misspelled it, I haven't studied French since 1970) for Miranda being a 'forbidden planet'. Well, I got a kick out of it just the same. If you liked the film, go see it again and again; take friends to see it. Let them view the series so they can fully enjoy the experience.

Is it as good as the TV show?Trick question. TV allows for the episodic evolution of characters, and when you have nine so expertly sketched and acted as the cast of Firefly, that space is really key to the series. In a movie, you have 2 hrs -- give or more usually take -- which means hyper-compression, and a necessity to focus on only a very few arcs. But it also allows for some incredibly big thrills, chills, and explosions along the way.River and Mal are given center stage, along with the Reavers story, and creative mastermind Joss Whedon uses his trademark brilliant dialog, brutalizing emotional content, and jaw-dropping set pieces to full effect, every bit as funny, terrifying, and surprising as I've come to (happily) expect.The only caveat I would give is that people unfamiliar with the Firefly TV show should watch it. They don't have to do it first, but it will certainly magnify the weight of the movie if they do so at some point. Whether Serenity introduces them to Firefly or vice versa, its definitely a journey worth taking and characters worth experiencing.	5.0	Serene Excellence	2006-01-05	10	10	0

The characters are well drawn, the situations have a believability about them in personal and universal terms and you wind up actually caring about what happens to these people in this universe. You want to see them succeed and continue on. Joss Whedon does a great job. He says more in one sentence with his well chosen cast than most sci fi writers say in a trilogy.

Now--to the package itself: nice clamshell box holds two disks, one with the film and the original bonus features, and the other with what appear to be all the bonus features from the original TV series DVD release, plus a rah-rah piece celebrating the film. Overall quality of the package is high, and frankly, is probably what we should've gotten to begin with. Interesting to ponder what Universal'll dig out for the show's 20th anniversary...A worthy addition, especially if you didn't get the original release of Serenity; otherwise, if you have the TV series boxed set and the film (and if you didn't, what's wrong with you?), you've already got it all.	5.0	Well, it was inevitable...	2013-02-05	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A29YM3RGBSSBVT	Reuben Thaker	No, I did not watch Firefly, but I love scifi.  I rented this on word of mouth, and did not know it was linked to a TV series.  This fact is very obvious though, as the movie looks like an installment of a series.  I was surprised it was ever released in theatres, as it feels straight to dvd (lost $15 million in release).In the future, 2 factions govern man's fate, including a totalitarian regime, that seeks to alter human behavior chemically.  The flashbacks of a conditioned/programmed teen girl 'Firefly' are very interesting, as the mystery of a secret society is revealed.  Social engineering gone awry is not a new theme to scifi, but this movie stays interesting even with mediocre effects and poor acting.	3.0	looks like a tv pilot and guess what...	2006-01-03	52	4	48
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1O7HSK24F11AT	"ReverendAngus ""gamer"""	I don't understand why throwing in a code for a digital copy is supposed to be so desirable. This has been a $7.99 bluray for years. Packing in the DVDs they can't sell doesn't add value either. The only reason we didn't get VHS tapes with DVDs during the format change is because they weren't as easy to repackage.I do highly recommend this movie but only if you watch the series first. I watched this before watching Firefly and didn't really enjoy it as much. This movie is really a series finale. After watching the series first it makes much more sense and the characters have much more depth. You can watch it first but you'll be seeing the ending first.Watch Firefly and then come back to this. There's only like 14 episodes in the series and they have a near movie like production quality. Absolutely worth the time of any SciFi fan.My rating is of the movie not the packaging.Edit: looks like Amazon has divulged more information.  Even more value.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1W8DBKWYVG803	"Rev. Pee Kitty ""PK"""	Serenity is, quite simply, one of the best sci-fi movies I've had the pleasure of seeing. The characters and their interactions are somehow witty and realistic at the same time, and the writing and directing is top-notch. I therefore purchased the (original edition) DVD the week it came out. If you don't own this movie, I recommend it highly, and would suggest getting this edition; it costs less (as of now) and has more special features.If you already own that DVD, however, this new 'collector's edition' isn't really worth upgrading to. The additional features are nice, but nothing mindblowing. If you're a die-hard fan who insists on having both copies, try to find this one at a decent price.	4.0	Great movie, average upgrade	2008-01-12	2	2	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2WL02ENWFU9PM	Rex Macaroe	"Serenity is the sci fi epic based on the show Firefly, a show which (in the words of its director) was ""immediately hailed as one of the most cancelled shows of the year."" But in its short run, it gained an incredibly strong cult following, and pressure from the show's fans and creators led to the creation of the film. In Joss Wheton's introduction to the film, he gives the fans equal credit with the film's creation, ""so if it sucks, it's your fault."" It didn't.Serenity is every sci fi fan's dream. Its special effects aren't really that special, but they're handled well enough that we believe them. Moreover, they're shown with style. Our first look at the ship Serenity isn't accompanied by a great ochestral score or the whir of a theremin, but by a banjo/violin duet which sings gently as the camera whooshes around the hull. Once inside, the captain calmly announces that the ship ""may experience some slight turbulence, then explode."" Earlier this year I praised Revenge of the Sith for its opening shot being a single long take, but Serenity does it one better with its Russian-Ark-esque steadicam shot of the crew planning a robbery after crash-landing.This all happens shortly after one of the most brilliant opening sequences I've ever seen. We're given a little background on how Earth colonized another solar system. As it turns out, it's a woman teaching a history class. As that turns out, the history class is the dream of a brainwash victim before her daring escape. As it turns out, the footage her daring escape was from a security feed being reviewed by the guy sent to catch her. It has more or less the same effect of someone dreaming about someone dreaming about someone dreaming and so on. I wondered if the whole film would continue in that sense. It didn't but I'm not complaining.Serenity might be a sci fi film, but it felt to me more like a western. That's not anything particularly original (Cowboy Bebop and Star Wars are notorious for drawing influence from western style), but Serenity almost seems doesn't know it's referencing the style. It never exploits it more than necessary. Come to think of it, there are also some samurai references, but likewise, the film only employs that style to drive its already intriguing story.I'm not sure it will work for everyone, but if you've ever watched a film on the Sci Fi Channel at one in the morning, or if you've ever attended Chillercon or similar conventions, or if you just like sci fi in general, Serenity is an experience that you will likely enjoy."	4.0	The ultimate sci-fi western samurai action comedy	2006-01-01	8	6	2

Luckily, it was easy to follow the story.  The writer does a wonderful job of making the story accessable to newbies like me, yet I could also sense there was a lot of old plots and loose ends being tied up.

One of the best parts is the very beginning when you first see the ship and Mal Reynolds makes some snide remarks about the ship falling apart. I actually own two copies of the DVD. One is the original, the other is this collectors edition. Both are basically the same, but the collector's version has a nice box and a few extra features.If you enjoy sci-fi or western films or maybe just mystery/adventure films, buy Serenity, you won't regret it!

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3N7HHBZNUJ6D6	R. Hedges	I haven't seen Firefly...yet, but you can watch this movie without it and still enjoy it.  Serenity has some really strong, and well developed characters.  It's great when you can see a film with actors and actresses who aren't well known, but can pull the job off as well as any big name hollywood cast member could.  It would be great to see a second Serenity film, but even if a follow up is never made, it's still a great film that stands on it's own merits and then some.The humor and weird slang are simply outstanding subtleties that really make this film special.I'll likely view the Firefly show in the near future as a result of how great this film was-which a very, very pleasant surprise for a change.	5.0	A great psuedo-western, science fiction film	2006-05-20	5	5	0

In my opinion, this movie is the best one released this year.  Period. In any category, class, genre, you name it.  Whatever the second best movie might be, is simply canine excrement to be scraped from the bottom of my shoe, in comparison (yes, I am pointing my finger at you, Mr. Lucas).Is the Serenity movie better than the Firefly series?  Well, it is simply not possible to exceed that benchmark.  But I will say that this movie is equal to the same high standards that Joss has established.  The story, plot, writing, and acting are superb.  The result is an experience that tickles all the emotions, so expect to laugh, cheer, and yes, bring some tissues too.	5.0	A good movie?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3FG45HL2Z4952	Richard Campbell	"This is an update to the original posting. Amazon won't let me review this edition, since I did a review for the original, which I gave a 5 star. So, with this ediiton I give a 1 star. Please read below.I absolutely LOVED the series and LOVED this movie. This review is ONLY on this recycled version of Serenity and NOTHING else.I bought this version, to go along with the original version, hoping it would contain all the ""extra cool"" features, such as the story of River's background, as well as all the ""extra footage"" that was claimed to be on this version. After all, it had TWO discs. All I can say is; save your money. If you have the original version, you don't need this. All the bonus material, for the most part, is already on the original cut. I was expecting a longer version of the movie, you know, like a director edition that contained all the ""bonus material"" and edited scenes, much like they advertised on this version. Nope. It's the same movie, same version, same everything. To charge full price for this was ridiculous. I don't if Joss is just trying to squeeze a little more juice/money, out of this series or what. But it's a really sad attempt at repacking. Oh, and as for the back-story to River...what a joke.A little more on the bonus material; I try and catch anything I can about Firefly. As I said, I LOVED this show, but how much do we have to hear Joss talk about himself and continually be the focal point of every bonus featurette? Yes, Roddenberry was very much like that with Star Trek, but at least he knew when to stop talking at let the actors do the bonus stuff. Plus, Star Trek is a phenomenon, Firefly, unfortunately, is not.If you don't have the original edition of Firefly, most defiantly, get this version, it does have cooler packaging. Otherwise, don't waste your money. You'll be very upset if you do.Although knowing the series before seeing the movie is really the best way to go, this movie does stand on it's own.  It's a bit fast paced to keep up with if you don't know the details of the characters, plots, and flow of the series, but it is a wonderfully filmed and played out movie.  I was vary happy with the storyline of the reavers and what ""made"" them.  Perfectly laid out to mankinds tinkering.Thank you Josh for giving us your imagination and this ""baby"" that you created called ""Firefly,"" and to the extension of that series.

Sadly the network that asked him to goto them didn't suppoert the project with constant pre-empting, order rearranging, and schedule shifting made for low ratings. The network gave the best show of the year the axe without even giving it a chance to let it grow. Both us the fans and Joss crusaded and fought. We eventually got the series on DVD.

The cast's close ties with each other comes through on the screen. Watching some of the cast in their roles on TV is fascination. I enjoy actors who can take on a role with carrying baggage or trait from a former character. Nathan Fillion (Castle) as Richard Castle is a far cry from the fatalist bad boy Mal. Summer Glu  (Arrow) has grown in a talented actress. And watching Gina Torres (Suits) reminds me she is  one of the more elegant actress to grace the screen.I rated this as 5 stars because of the smart script, great direction, and a solid cast	5.0	A great move to add to anyone's collection	2014-02-25	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AXOS8IWBXNZGT	"Richard W Little ""I am a maple leaf on the wi..."	"I saw the film Serenity a couple of weeks ago. Based upon the short-lived TV series Firefly, the film is a science fiction actioner...fast-paced, with twists, and with a sense of humour.The cast of the TV show re-united for the film. It's a likeable, solid cast--all no-name character actors, which emphasizes the ensemble feel.While the film spends a few minutes introducing the ""Firefly universe"" at the start, for the most part the characters are introduced on the fly. The setting: some 500 years from now, Earth has been abandoned, with humanity setting out into the universe to re-settle, and a military conflict has recently concluded with the outcome of uniting all the settled worlds under a rather intrusive central government. The intro allows folks not familiar with the series to come up to speed pretty quickly.As for the story, it would appear to be the intended end of the series' first season. For those not in the know, the ""Serenity"" is the ship populated by most of the main characters, who are a band of smugglers and thieves who descended into this lifestyle following being on the losing side in the aforementioned military conflict, with a few stragglers (read: fugitives) picked up along the way. One of these fugitives is a character by the name of River, a psychic who has learned some nasty truths about the central government's actions in the past few years, and the government would rather she were dead, than walking about with those secrets. It is the discovery and unfurling of those secrets that is at the heart of the plot.It's an entertaining story. The characters, despite being on the bad side of the law, are flawed but good at heart, and they care for each other like family.All in all, it makes for an enjoyable film.It is a film with violence, and death, but older kids should be able to handle this quite well."	4.0	a shiny film	2005-10-16	8	6	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2HZM2D62AH57K	Rich The Reviewer	Serenity picks up six months after the cancellation of the TV series Firefly and we see what has become of the crew of the spaceship Serenity. Serenity does in about two hours what the series should have/would have done over the life of the show had it been allowed to continue. In a way this is a bad thing for fans of the show because had the series went on the events of the movie would have played out over a much longer time building the tension further and giving the viewers more insight to the characters. Fortunatly, there came the movie to tie up the loose ends as to all the why's that fans did not know.Serenity delivers on all fronts. It gives the viewer action and adventure and allows the charactors to give out a little revenge of their own on the 'evil' forces out there looking to stop them. All the original charactors are back, though not all have as much time as they would have during the series. Even though the loose ends are tied up (at least with River) the ending leaves open the possiblity of another follow up movie. Best case scenario for fans of Firefly would be a new movie and an even better case scenario would be a series of TV movies on a cable channel.If you have never seen the series Firefly, rent or buy it on DVD to catch up before watching Serentiy (though the opening scenes do bring the viewer up to partial speed as to why the crew does what it does.Either way, Serenity is a good piece of old fashioned Sci-Fi action.	4.0	Reviewing the movie not the DVD	2006-06-22	8	6	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A10SEP2OOYCFNQ	Rion Wetzel	I only fell in love with the tv series, Firefly, about a month before Serenity was released in theatres.  Once I started watching I couldn't stop and my excitement for the film went through the roof.  I was not disappointed at all.  This film is the best adaptation for the big screen that could have been done for this show.  Yes, there are story elements that had to be let go, simply because they don't fit in a 90 minute film.  As much as I wanted this show to continue on tv for season after season, the film had the look and feel of the show.  The characters translated well to the big screen and the action was amped up to fill the giant shoes of a sci-fi action flick.  One of the big mysteries of the show is answered and in spectacular fashion, and we get to spend another hour and a half with our favorite characters.  I can only hope that the series finds new life on film or on tv or even on direct to dvd.  Any sci-fi fan cannot go wrong with Firefly and Serenity.	5.0	Everything I loved about Firefly taken to the silver screen!	2007-04-26	7	5	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A323FDM5TLPJ2Q	RJBrian	In my opinion (for what it's worth) Serenity is one of the best movies out there, Joss Whedon (the creator of Buffy The Vampire Slayer) at his finest.  It has everything, Action, Drama, Horror, Suspense and Comedy.  What more could you want from a movie?  The only bad thing about it was that it had to end.  I just hope that they are planning on making sequels.For those of you that don't know Serenity is a movie spin off of the short lived Fox TV series Firefly.  It was canceled by the evil Fox network after only a few episodes.  But thanks to the loyal fans of the series (like myself) Firefly has been raised from the dead and been reborn as Serenity.  Never before has a TV show been canceled within it's first season been made into a movie, and not to mention a successfully one.So what are you waiting for?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AI06QZOVBHIES	RJ	For the past ten days I've been living in Joss Whedon's universe. It all started with a copy of the series Firefly.  Wow, what a great show! I'd never seen it before and can only add my vote to those who morn its demise. I was expecting the movie Serenity to be just as amazing, but unfortunately I was disappointed. Serenity lacked the warmth and humor of Firefly, and I couldn't feel the bond between the characters so evident in the series. Sorry, but for me Serenity is a cold, overly violent and forgettable B movie. After Firefly I was ready to join the Browncoats. Now I feel more like an Alliance mole.	2.0	Sorry	2011-02-21	16	7	9

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3MU5O1170B3LB	R. L. Frank	Let me first say the blu ray audio and video quality is very good, which increases ones enjoyment of the movie.The movie is not simply a long episode of Firefly.  It is darker, more focused with a lot of serious action.  To accomplish this, it has to give up some of the whimsy of the series.  You may miss this in the beginning of the movie, but as the story line draws you in and you begin to realize what is at stake for the characters, you become less concerned with comic relief and more concerned with what lies ahead.  As the movie nears its conclusion, the intense action and gut-wrenching occurrences, grab you and hold you there.  It is an emotional experience.This movie is different than the series it is based on, but has the same excellence.	5.0	Different, but Equal	2011-05-28	0	0	0

How horrible that a movie exists that actually believes each of us owns our own lives! Wow. That each of us should decide for ourselves how those lives should be lived. Gee. That rejects the social-engineering that is the hallmark of today's world.I suspect that the vast majority of those who reject this movie are those who support collectivism and statism, who think they have the right to force others to live as _they_ want them to live, who run in terror from anything that smacks of real freedom, real rights, real morality, real heroes.Such people deserve each other.Go see this movie.	5.0	Your life belongs to you	2005-10-03	14	10	4

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1PRPEVCL9BK47	R. Medcalf	First of all, don't watch this movie if you haven't seen Firefly. I had recently emptied my Netflix que and I needed to get a few more rentals in before I cancelled my account. I came to Amazon seeing which DVDs were best sellers. Sereneity was there which led me to Firefly. So I watched all the Firefly shows and then rented Serenity.You can watch this movie without having seen Firefly and you'll probably still enjoy it, but knowing each of the characters beforehand, makes this movie a lot better.It's a great movie and Firefly fans were lucky to get a movie based off of a cancelled TV show.At first you may find it a little different than the TV series. For instance, in the series not a whole lot of attention was given to River, she was kept a mystery for the most part. In the movie though, they focus alot more on Rivers abilities while leaving out of the stuff I enjoyed most such as Jaynes friendship with Book, Inara and Malcom, etc. The movie suffered most in that  it's believed to be the last of Firefly/Serenity on the screen so Joss Whedon had to cram as much as he could in two hours, still some questions are left unanswered. Maybe a SciFi TV movie can answer more?	4.0	Great Movie from an even better TV Show	2006-01-26	5	4	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"Serenity(released Aug/05)is a quite decent Sci-Fi flick that is descended from the TV series Firefly.I have never seen Firefly the TV series,but am aware of the serie's premature cancellation and the following it has developed.As a Star Trek original series fan I know all about such things.So this review is really kind of reverse engineering in a literary sense and a look at this film in situ.The movie begins aboard the spaceship Serenity captained by the less than loquacious Capt.Reynolds(Nathan Fillion).He was on the losing side of the Unification War against the Alliance(similarities abound in likening him to a soldier from the South during the Civil War)and during a maintenance stop at a space station the captain takes aboard two strangers,a brother and sister.The sister(River Tam) has obvious strong mental abilities and her brother is the only one that can keep her in check.She periodically refers to ""Miranda"" but no one including herself can understand what it means. They risk being tossed off the ship many times but the captain sees past the risk.However,not only does the government have a special agent following Tam,the Alliance is sending out special triggering signals to set her off,whenever possible.The captain contacts a friend called Mr Universe who discovers that these ""triggers""are for a special purpose.They also eventually learn that Miranda is an uninhabited planet that was devastated,supposedly,due to a terraforming accident years before.They decide to head for Miranda and  along the way they stop in at a familiar outpost and safe haven only to find all have been slaughtered,thanks to an Alliance agent who wants Tam back.After a running battle they escape the planet and head for their ultimate destination.However the way is blocked by Reavers,a savage half human race whose thirst for blood is only surpassed by their thirst for killing.Disguising themselves they get their ship past the blockade.On Miranda there is no one there alive,it is just full of corpses.They also discover what really happened on Miranda was not a simple terraforming accident.There was an agent put into the chemical used,to suppress aggression which killed most of the populace while turning the rest into Reavers.This disturbing information is sent to Mr Universe who is killed before he can transmit it broad band throughout the Alliance territories.Reynolds and crew head back to see Mr Universe but are followed by the Reavers.They discover a dead Mr Universe and have to hold off the Reavers until they can transmit a back up copy.Some of Reynolds crew dies but the attacking Reavers are repelled and the message is sent out.The Alliance operative after Tam finally realizes the extent of the Alliances crimes and backs off the hunt,but it doesn't mean more agents won't follow him and Tam,who now becomes one of Reynolds crew.It is an exciting plot throughout and holds ones interest all the way.I was pleasantly surprised to see some fine actors like Gina Torres,who goes by Gin Torres in the credits,better known for her roles in Hercules and Cleopatra 2020 among others,Adam Baldwin who I recall from X Files and old Ron Glass from Barney Miller.The entire cast gels beautifully and the glue is Fillion himself who does a wonderful job as the persnickety captain of the Serenity,who likes to run his ship HIS way.As I said this review is coming from someone who has never seen the show,so if I am suitably impressed by the movie and its world and what its creator Joss Whedon is presenting,then I think that is really saying something.It stands alone as just plain good Science Fiction.Technically speaking this DVD comes in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1,is clear and crisp,and includes extras like a Whedon intro,commentary,a featurette on the Firefly phenom and 20 minutes of extra deleted scenes and outtakes.All in all Serenity is a wonderful stand alone film.For the fans of Firefly it's just a natural to get,but anyone interested in good Sci-Fi should be picking this up too.If you're like me it will probably lead you to pursue the short lived TV series to see just what the fuss is all about and maybe become a ""brown shirt"" along the way.Hmmm, a brown shirt Trekker...it could work!Highly recommended."	4.0	4-4 1/2 stars-Nice Sci Fi flick!	2012-06-25	1	0	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	I enjoyed this as action sci-fi, with an ambitious concept and pretty good actors, but I didn't quite suspend my disbelief for a lot of it.  In the beginning, I got into it as it was full of intriguing notions:  a mutant beauty with extraordinary powers in thrall to a techno-totalitarian regime.  Escapes and takes refuge on a ship with a quirky crew.  None of the actors that well known, with  few exceptions.  Then, as the plot thickened, it kind of lost me - they are running, re-discover their ideals, fight a bunch of monsters, then make a difference with a discovery they must share.  That is a lot to accomplish in 2 hours, and I didn't feel that they quite did.While the actors are not big stars, their performances are at least better than average and often excellent.  It is good, hard sci-fi.  REcommended with these caveats.	3.0	Intriguing, even without blue chip actors, but lacking magic	2010-05-07	2	0	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"WARNING:  Multiple spoilers!I first discovered the world of FIREFLY upon the release of the DVD set and had been anxiously awaiting the release of the feature film since I first learned two years ago that it was going to be made, even suffering this past spring when they moved the release date from April to September.  I am ecstatic to report that it was worth the wait and I can't imagine even the most tepid fan of the series being at all disappointed with the filmAt the end of the series, which was cancelled without the initial story arcs being resolved, and which in most probability show up in the feature film, I was left with three main questions:  1) what would have happened with Mal and Inara, 2) just precisely what was the deal with River, and 3) what was the secret of Shepherd Book's background.  The film only deals with the second of the three questions in full and merely hints at the first.  As the series ended, Inara, after she and Mal had pretty much confessed that they had strong feelings for one another, indicated that she was going to leave Serenity.  The movie starts back up with her gone, but not back to the life of a companion, but to what Mal would call the Whore Academy, presumably as an instructress.  In watching the show, most of the romantic interest of the series focused on whether the two would hook up, and the film ends with Inara back on Serenity, obviously loathe to leave, though with her and Mal's status not at all defined.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any answers will ever be forthcoming about Book for reasons that are made obvious to anyone seeing the movie.The structure for FIREFLY was given, however, not by romance, but by the question of precisely who River Tam was, what the Alliance had done to her, and why they were so intent on recapturing her.  At the end of the series we knew only a little about her, that she possessed some kind of psychic ability, that she was physically agile, that she was a genius, and that she had been shattered by her experiences.  We had gotten glimpses of what she was capable of, such as memorably shooting three soldiers at a distance with a handgun with her eyes closed, or dispatching of a bounty hunter who had overcome all the other crew members in a way that suggested she found it a mildly diverting game.  Here we get the complete version, seeing everything she is capable of, going into a bar and battering everyone in it in a few seconds, including Jayne, who proved to be no match for the tiny girl.  But it leaves Mal and the others with the question of whether she was only a weapon or also a human being.  Summer Glau, whose first acting job came on ANGEL when Joss Whedon needed a professional ballerina for an episode, does a good job as River.  The role is more about movement and posture than anything and choosing a dancer for the part was a great decision.  Her ability to move is key to her success in the role and is crucial to her fight scenes being so believable.The film is much, much darker than the series, darker even than the way Mal was portrayed in the series premiere (not as broadcast but as it appears on the DVD set).  Jayne says before they hold up a bank, ""Let's go be bad guys,"" and in a way they do.  Of course, by the end of the film Mal's suppressed idealism comes back and the crew ends doing something rather heroic in the name of the truth.  The movie is also dark because of all the reavers.  Not only there lots of reavers, we learn the secret of their origin and how this is entangled with precisely why the Alliance is so desperate to find River.As fans of Joss Whedon know, he loves a good body count (I once counted a total of seventeen significant deaths on BUFFY and ANGEL) and SERENITY is not exception.  Not all the crew survives and indeed at one point it wasn't obvious that any would.All in all, this is the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long, long time.  I honestly can compare the fun to other experiences such as seeing STAR WARS for the first time or THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The plot was rich and fun and the action sequences were plentiful and delightful.  Chiwetel Ejiofor was absolutely splendid as The Agent, the man without a name or security number who sought the capture of River in order to create, as he imagines it, a better world.  Whedon loves to play with viewer's expectations in his various projects, and the way he handles The Agent is no exception.  The sets were marvelous throughout and frankly I liked the way the film made outer space look much better than George Lucas did in THE PHANTOM MENACE.  In the latter special effects were employed with something approaching baroque excess while in SERENITY they are used only so far as they are necessary to tell the story.  Also, the film was filled with the marvelous one-liners that seem to permeate the script.So what's next?  A renewal of the TV series is banned because of the 12-year TV ban that was part of the deal they struck with Universal in getting the film made.  The word is that the studio hoped to make a trilogy of films depending on how well the film does at the box office.  The first weekend the film has done well though not spectacularly.  Luckily, Whedon brought the film in under budget and under time, two considerations that are of major significance.  My own guess is that the film is going to do well enough for Universal to pick up the option for another film.  Just have DVD sales for the series has been astonishingly high, so I would expect the DVD sales to be superb.  With Whedon's productions far more popular in Europe and the UK than in the US, the film should do exceptionally well on the international box office.  I expect that in the end it will turn enough of a profit to demand a second film.  Besides, we need to see how things turn out between Mal and Inara."	5.0	Everything you want to know about River and Reavers	2005-10-02	22	21	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AK95AUC8SRHMP	Robert Patton	I had not seen Firefly before watching this movie, so I was unprepared for the crazy setting - an outlaw western version of space.  I say crazy because before seeing the movie I would not have believed it possible to pull of such a scenario, but it worked very well.  The plot itself was very good, and overall the movie was very entertaining but the most impressive aspect to me was simply the new and different take on space.  Not having seen the TV shows, the characters did not mean much to me and I did not follow all of the  subtleties of their interactions.  I did later watch the Firefly series and then rewatch Serenity, that time around it was far more dramatic.

I am a Sci-Fi Fan (Star Wars, Star Trek, Etc.) but this one was not enjoyable. It had a few laughs, but there was always an ""evil"" undertone to the entire film, I watched the behind the scenes and the interviews, and for some reason all the people used a lot of profanity, not sure why?I think if the storyline was tweaked a bit, and better actors were used (the main character showed no expression in his face, he would say one line in anger and the other in happiness, all with the same expression), with a slightly larger budget, the movie would have been good.I'm going to be selling this one!Don't Waste your Money."	2.0	Bad Acting.	2007-02-22	1	0	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A306Z6Q4YV0DDC	"Robert Torres ""Bobby Shaddoe"""	Although I became a fan of the series Firefly long after it had been unceremoniously cancelled on 'Fox', I decided to take a chance and bought the DVD boxset for the series in order to prepare myself for the movie 'Serenity'.  I fell in love with these characters and the universe they inhabit, and watching each episode seeing how awesome the show was made me even more upset that Fox had treated the show and Joss Whedon so terribly, and it also made me more than happy as I eagerly anticipated the release of 'Serenity', in the hopes that the story would continue as a franchise of films much better than the Star Trek films or even the recent batch of Star Wars films.My fiancee and I went to see the film and we spent two glorious hours watching our favorite ensemble cast continuing their adventures, showing absolutely no signs that any time had passed, even though technically for them only a few months had passed, and for my fiancee and I only a day had passed since we had watched the entire series over the course of a few weeks leading up to the premiere of this movie.  and for many fans maybe a year or two had gone by, but anyway, seeing the film was a definite vindication for science fiction in general, because its not often that a series that barely lasted a full season gets turned into a major motion picture, but we can all be greatful that Universal has a much better appreciation for this show, these characters and the universe they inhabit than Fox did.The movie itself is fantastic, and I know it may be a bit biased since I'm already a fan, but even if I weren't a fan of the show I'd still think it's a brillaint movie, and if I wasn't already a fan of the series, this movie would prompt me to become a fan, that's how good it is.I can only hope that this movie will spark sequels or even a renewed television series, I don't know, stranger things have happened, but the one thing that's abundantly clear, the story of the crew of Serenity is far from over. In fact, it's just beginning.	5.0	The future IS worth fighting for!	2005-10-18	9	8	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2I2FMZ48EUAXM	robtmorg	"This is a 3.5 star B-movie.  To claim it's more than that is to over-rate the production values.  The story is recycled, its vision is narrow and simplistic, the actors shift into and out of their accents from scene to scene, the special effects are TV-movie quality, and the imagery is out of context (spaceships emerging from an ""ion cloud"" in space as if they were Lord Nelson's fleet emerging from a fog bank?  Please.)  So why 3.5 stars?  Star Wars (at least the last 3 installments) had much better special effects, a grander vision, and attempted an epic scope, but failed for the same reasons that this movie succeeds.  Star Wars was pompous and tedious, this movie is fun.  The characters are multi-dimensional (if also anachronistic -- if that's not a non sequitor, given the context), and the actors (forget the bad accents) actually try to inhabit their characters instead of mailing in their performances.  And they have imaginative dialog to work with.  Note to George Lucas: next time, skimp on a few of the droid effects so that you can pay an actual screenwriter.  The look River gives Simon when he asks, ""am I talking to Miranda now?"" is better than anything in the last three Star Wars installments.  And if the story is recycled, what story isn't these days?  All in all, a keeper."	3.0	worth a look	2006-02-06	15	4	11

The picture quality is sharper (not edgy) and the sound more dynamic compared to the regular dvd.  Not night and day difference.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"**1/2""Serenity"" is writer/director Joss Whedon's theatrical film follow-up to his defunct TV series, ""Firefly.""  I have never seen the original show so I have no idea how a fan would be likely to react to this film.  As a newbie, however, I can only report that ""Serenity"" might have been a bit more fun if it didn't look and feel quite so much like a ""Star Wars"" wannabe.  Instead of the ""Empire,"" here we have the ""Alliance"" as the mega-force against which the rebel forces are fighting.  The twist in this case is that the rebels have been forced to give up their more noble aspirations of overthrowing a repressive regime and have turned to what amounts to inter-galactic bank robbery and payroll heists to put food on the table after suffering a defeat in the war with the Alliance.  Malcolm Reynolds' transport ship, Serenity, is the equivalent of Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, with its rogue passengers doing battle with the evil forces of not only the Alliance but some carnivorous creatures known as Reavers.The story begins with a 17-year old girl named River, who possesses psychic powers, being brainwashed at the hands of ruthless scientists working for the Alliance.  After her brother, Doc, rescues her from the laboratory, the two of them seek refuge on the Serenity, a ship whose crew is unaware of River's troublesome background.  Soon, the captain, Mal, and his cohorts are plunged into a battle with the Alliance forces who are attempting to destroy River at any and all costs.  Again, as in ""Star Wars,"" the ship and its crew engage in an intergalactic chase with a force much bigger and more powerful that they somehow must find a way to defeat.  There's even a scene so reminiscent of the Luke-I-Am-Your-Father encounter in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that I half expected the combatants to whip out their light sabers at any moment.Despite the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that permeates the work, ""Serenity"" has a few fun moments involving the characters' interactions with one another.  The rebels aboard the Serenity are not always prime candidates for heroism, often acting as much out of fear and self-interest as righteousness and courage.  The acting is generally wooden, but the plotting is intriguing enough to sustain our interest through most of the movie.  The special effects are a mite below par for what one would expect to find in a sci-fi film today, but Whedon pushes the action along fast enough to keep us distracted from some of the weaknesses in the visuals.This is definitely a mixed bag when it comes to science fiction entertainment.  The dialogue ranges from the sharp to the cheesy, as does virtually everything else in the movie.  It makes for OK viewing, but, in all honesty, you'd be better off popping ""Star Wars"" into the DVD player and watching the real thing instead."	2.0	oK at times but too indebted to Star Wars	2006-08-27	44	6	38
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2A3G4RPP0ML0A	"Roland Gonzales ""DesignRol"""	Serenity is the final episode, as it were, of the Firefly sci-fi series. Since the show was cancelled after one season, over-whelming response from loyal fans of the show inundated the powers at be responsible for this Awesome show. Director, Joss Whedon, decided to make a theatrical version of the show that would make a final statement of a wonderfully written and original idea for a space opera that never had the chance to let the characters and the storyline mature to it's fullest. The CGI-special effects are excellent and and believable. The sets are well designed and the costumes are well suited for the atmosphere of the show. Not, distracting or taking away from the importance of the characters.If you are a fan or just like the Firefly series, I highly recommend this DVD. If you haven't seen the series and have seen this DVD or motion picture, I highly suggest you rent or buy the series Firefly.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A16FL425UB2847	"Ronald L. Jones ""Arjayuniverse"""	I will make this short and sweet because I hated this movie with every fiber of my being. But, before I actually sat through the movie at the theater, I considered myself to be a major believer in the pre-release hype. I love the television series because of it's sence of pure adventure. I, a black man, am not too fond of country music, but the theme song of this series was a catchy tune that I have never tried to forget. I was so looking foreword to this movie.The first slap to my face when the movie started was the absance of the theme music. UNFORGIVABLE! Second, the lack of the humor in the television show was jarring to me. Third, and most important,- Josh Wedon kills off the two characters that I identify with. That fact was a dagger through my goddamn heart. There is more but I will stop with these facts.The movie pulled in about 25 million at the box office. In order for Josh Whedon to have delivered a blockbuster he would have had to have  given movie goers a reason to attend the movie two or three times. He did not deliver. He turned what should have been an uplifting romp that forced viewers to repeated viewings into a depressing, letdown that forced viewers to ponder what they had just seen. The proof of this assertion is in the box office receipts.Josh Wedon has made his living producing quirky, screw-with-your-head product. SERENITY should have demanded more respect than Mr. Whedon held back.I mean, come on Josh Whedon, you kill off two main characters - characters who's back-stories had not even been remotely tapped into. But, and I do not understand this piece of bullcrap - YOU ALLOW THE BAD GUY, A SELF-PROFESSED MURDERER OF CHILDREN AND WOMEN, TO NOT ONLY LIVE BUT RUN OFF INTO THE SUNSET WITH A GODDAMN SMILE AND SMIRK ON HIS FACE. And I am suppose to want to see this mess again? And pay money for admittance? NO!Actually, I should have started this review with the question, 'What in the hell is wrong with Josh Whedon?'The DVD itself is a must have if you are a crazed fan of the director. It is full of the extras stuff you desire. Just remember, as you plunk down your hard earned money for this DVD, you were screwed this Summer by Josh Whedon. You don't know it because you were asleep. I am here to tell you what actually happened to you!	5.0	Great DVD from and overated Mr. Whedon	2005-12-25	45	4	41

I havnt seen it since the last time i saw it, but I remember it being a fantastic movie. Joss Whedon had a great idea with Firefly/Serenity and too bad it all ended too soon. But sometimes that isnt always a bad thing. Because the series and the movie is short enough before it started to have flaws makes it an instant classic for me.

When people would try to describe it to me to get me to watch it, they would always call it a sci-fi western or a comedy sci-fi western. That just didn't sound like anything worth watching. It took them a long time to get me to watch the show, but when I did I couldn't believe how much fun it was. I have since got my parents and my siblings hooked on this show, it just appeals to everyone. The movie, while very very fun and well worth watching, doesn't answer all the questions you'd expect it to, so don't expect complete closure.Serenity (Widescreen Edition),Serenity (Collector's Edition)And it will help a lot to those new to Firefly to go back and watch the series before the film,Firefly - The Complete Series. But being able to watch this awesome cast for 2 more hours of fun was wonderful. The biggest letdown was undeniably the completely unresolved issue of Book's storyline. The fact that they didn't even attempt to explain his past upset us all. But all in all, this is a must own as a fair ending to a great series, and not very many shows can say they at least got a chance to give any sort of ending or resolve to it.	4.0	Not enough closure	2007-08-15	11	9	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2RVOYWAS4U0HR	Ronny Max	Five hundred years into the future, the human race moved to a new solar system with many planets. When the central planets created the Alliance government, a group of Browncoats fought and lost the war for self-rule. Among the renegades are Mal Reynolds and his crew, flying in a Firefly class spaceship called Serenity, searching for petty theft jobs, trying to stay alive. Along the way, they picked up two runaways, a doctor and his psychic but mentally unstable sister. And River Tam carries a secret, which the Alliance's Assassin will stop at nothing to prevent exposure.Whedon brought back the same stellar cast from the cancelled television series Firefly. The movie has western motifs (Browncoats, frontier settings, a draw duel), and plenty of fantastic frames starting from the logo flashing to the future, to the classroom, to the lab, to the Assassin. When we see River's elegant dancer feet, we know danger is coming.The script is quirky, rhythmic (with Chinese curses), and the dialogs superbly blend humor with terror. And Whedon makes his point. The Assassin is a believer. He covets utopia, which the Alliance promises, to justify the violence and destruction he creates. He comforts his victims with `this is a good death' and `there is no shame'. He is composed, pleasant, and honorable. `What I do is evil. I have no illusions. But it must be done.' When he confronts Mal, he asks `Do you know what is your sin, Mal?' To which the stubborn and grumpy rebel who finally found a cause, replies `Hell, I'm a fan of all seven.'Joss Whedon created a sci-fi masterpiece that reminds us the road to hell is paved with good intentions. We have the right to be wrong. Now, can we get Firefly back?	5.0	sci-fi masterpiece that reminds us the road to hell is paved with good intentions	2005-12-26	7	7	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"""Serenity"" refers to one of two things - it's the name of a run-down space-going freighter captained by Mal. Reynolds.  It was also the name of a valley where was fought the final battle against The Alliance for control of space.  In the distant future, with Earth being a vague memory, The Alliance is dominant.  Control of planets and interstellar travel is almost entirely within the Alliance's domain.  Serenity and her tight-knit crew spend much of their time in that realm of ""almost"".  The only other possible contender for domination of the stars is the ""Reavers"" - a mysterious group of monstrously violent humans who treat their victims with unspeakable brutality, sort of like a cross between Klingons and the Evil Dead.  outwardly, Reynolds seems dispassionate about interstellar freedom - with his crew, he takes on ""jobs"" that straddle (at best) the law, and he's not up to fighting another losing battle with the now all-powerful Alliance.  In this feature film, Reynolds must now take on The Alliance, forced to protect his passenger - River Tam - from them.  Augmented by Alliance technology, River is something of a super-being intended as some kind of weapon.  Rescued by her brother from an Alliance lab before the original series began, River is now the subject of this flick.  Pursued across by the Alliance, Reynolds's only hope is a mysterious world that the Alliance does not control - one deep inside Reaver territory.I really wanted to like this flick, which displays some pretty crisp dialog for a sci-fi flick, but never really comes together.  Gina Torres and Adam Baldwin rock the action better than they did in ""Alias"" and ""Chuck"" respectively, but ""Serenity"" doesn't suffer from a lack of ""rock"" - rather it's one of those flicks that people want to make, but never actually put together.  The story gives us a disarmingly sinister character called ""The Operative"" who's assigned to recover River Tam for The Alliance.  The problem is, we never get a sense (in the movie anyway) as to what The Alliance really stands for - we just sort of assume that they're some authoritarian outfit, the type seen in countless TV shows, films and video games.  Mal & the Operative share some interesting banter when they first meet, but the Operative is smart enough to recognize stalling-for-time when he hears it, and tactless enough to clue us in.  Their next face-to-face meeting is a fight, which debases the film into a kind of video game, an RPG where meetings result in either conversation or combat.The story's biggest weakness is that it seldom feels like it's going anywhere - a plot-thread about River becomes a thread about the Reavers, glued together by the angst of the crew and (ineffectually) by a shared fear or hatred of the Alliance.  These threads would have been best served by arcing plots on a running TV show (yeah, we know it WAS a show, and that it was cancelled while inferior and over-hyped shows and reality TV survived, but don't blame us - it's not our fault!!).  These same plot threads feel awkwardly compressed in a feature film, like an overstuffed suitcase.  Worst of all, the script bathes itself and its characters in a form of sentimentality that deservedly rewards fans of the show, but just confuses those like us who were hoping to discover it with this flick.  Most of the time, the characters have this fun and easygoing rappaport, (the best lines go to, are aimed at or are about Torres and Baldwin, natch), but then get serious and heroic, even though the script doesn't really establish why these guys care about anything or how they can embody such a range of morals and emotion.  In short, the flick appeaars to pick up where the series left off.  I'm going to give the franchise the benefit of the doubt and just guess that what's missing in this movie is simply included in the episodes of the show - so if you are going to get into ""Serenity"", it probably helps to have watched at least most of the show that it's based on.  I'll leave it to the bloggers to decide whether a stand-alone movie is too much to ask, but in this case, it's more than you can expect."	3.0	Probably helps to have watched (at least most of) the original series first	2008-01-03	6	2	4

The second commentary is the major difference between the Standard and Collector's Addition.  It's very much dominated by Joss Whedon (writer & producer) and Nathan Fallion (Mal) (no surprise there) and is an utterly missed opportunity to explore characters and provide back story.  But in fairness to Nathan Fallion, he does ask others to comment.Ron Glass's (Book's) question about his character's background is not answered by Whedon.  Here's my take - Book was an officer (probably upper level) in an elite anti-crime or CIA like unit, something happened he didn't like, so he left to become a preacher; this was hypothesized from the TV series, which was the basis for the movie.  At one point Whedon describes Simon's devotion to his sister (River) as a fantasy, that this level of devotion couldn't exist.  Well I hope Josh gets to know more of Life; it does exist; and it's not even that uncommon among some groups.Also, if you were hoping to get to know Summer Glau (River) better, except for some stuff in the expanded production section, you may be disappointed.  She says very little throughout the 2 hour commentary.  Nevertheless, Serenity's premise makes for excellent SiFi, and it is a  fun movie.  The question that can't help but surface is, if Joss had such tremendous success with the series DVD sales, why did he abandon plot depth for flash?  The series really sold on substance, not flash.Again, Serenity is good SiFi and a fun ride.  If you can't get enough, then the Collector's Addition is a good idea; on the other hand, if you're not a die-hard fan with a ""regular"" TV,  I'd recommend getting the standard full-screen version.  The Collector's Addition is worth every penny of the $18; and, overall, I was glad to contribute to the effort."	4.0	"Very good movie but you won't learrn much new in ""Collector's Edition"""	2007-08-25	7	6	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3U9E7K65AYZ61	R. Pandolfo	For Firefly fans, this movie is a must watch. I thought the Blu Ray picture and sound was very good. The movie is action packed and has the edge-of-the-seat suspense that keeps it moving along, as the TV show did. However, right from the beginning it doesn't have the same light-hearted feel of the TV show, which I missed. This movie, perhaps the final chapter in the story of the brave Firefly captain and his gallant crew, is more violent, serious, and humorless. I wouldn't watch it again, but I will watch the original TV series again.	4.0	Good action sci-fi, but I liked the TV show better	2011-01-21	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3PM1QNZ1O8EXF	"..R.. ""..R.."""	I fell in love with the Firefly series from the very first episode. But the FOX network being the pathetic clowns they are went and canceled a series that had already been building up a huge fallowing. I was crushed when they canceled Firefly but not surprised. The FOX network's landscape is full of creations canceled due to lower then wanted ratings. FOX has this thing, they will cancel a show even if millions are watching, just because they find joy in crushing people's sand Castles. Sometime later when the series DVD came out. The shows popularity went up even higher then before! I was lucky enough to buy the set the day of it's release, while others had to find stores with a current supply of the DVD's. I remember the set moving up into the fifth all around rating on Amazon.FOX, like others, now sees that rating are only a small part of the overall viewing audience. DVD's are literary Gold! Films like the very first (Blade) movie which did not do all that well in the threaters, made Gold on DVD sales.That being said, this movie is so much better then I was hoping it to be. I was hooked into the plot right from the opening scene. Seeing the FireFly transport ship called the Serenity flying towards a planet with the epic Modern/Western music playing in the background. It was like I found home again. I remember waiting for months and months for the show to hopefully come back. Then waiting more and more months for the DVD set. So seeing a full-pledged movie on the Firefly and her crew was so perfect for me.Now I am not going to post a review telling you anything about the plot, because I always hated those people that went way too far into the plot before you have even had a chance to see the movie. All I will say, is I cried at the end of this movie.I hope so mega much that there will be sequels to this movie. I will watch them until I die,  that is how much I love this story. If you loved the show, you will feel right at home. If you are new to the whole story, then you will find your way to being a fan.Please buy as many DVD's as you can! So all of us fans will have more chapters in the story to look froward to.The production studies make most of their profit on DVD sales, so it is never too late to support this series.Just give Serenity a chance. It is well worth your time and money.	5.0	The FOX network had no idea what they had!	2005-12-21	15	14	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AS6SH2JM2YY3H	R S Cobblestone	"I was introduced to Serenity.  Afterwards, I was told that it was the conclusion to something calledFirefly.  So after Serenity, then Firefly, I came back to Serenity.And it was better the second time.Serenity, the movie, is an entertaining sci-fi adventure.  The crew of the Firefly-class ship Serenity, captained by Captain Mal Reynolds, define themselves and their role in society when they rob an outer world bank.  But the Reavers, mad, cannibalistic space ""pirates"" (for lack of a better term), interrupt the robbery, and the crew continues to interact with them through the remainder of this tale.  Meanwhile, River Tam's (a girl made into an Alliance bioweapon) secrets continue to leak out.  She is a warrior, after all, and she has absorbed the memories of senior Alliance officials that give her insight into the mysterious planet, Miranda.But the search for River by the Alliance has gone into high gear.  An Operative sent after her is relentless, and merciless, as he tracks her down.Reavers, the Operative, River, and Serenity's crew come to meet at the nexus of Mr. Universe's... universe.  You can't stop the wave.Confused?  Firefly, the series, will show you the way.  But Serenity, the movie, is entertaining regardless.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1HDAP6T69MIRS	Ruth	Firefly was the best Sci Fi I have ever seen. I appreciated Serenity as a filler to give closure but didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the series. Considering the amount of info they had to pack into that movie to make it work for people who hadn't seen the series it was very well done, but I'm not much much of an &#34;action&#34; fan. I liked the humanity of Firefly and that was missing in the movie. The characters had so much depth to them and were so real. *Firefly Spoilers* In Firefly Mal has his harsh moments but you also see his tender side. In Serenity all you see is his harsh side. Book and Inara are practically slashed, and you don't get to see any of that hostility to friendship Firefly developed between them. Simon is practically a Rambo in the movie instead of his nurturing sensitive inhibited self that contrasts so much with Kaylees outgoing personality but very very slowly brought them together. If I had seen Serenity on its own I would not have enjoyed it. The movie also missed a lot of the culture that was woven into the series. If you love action packed movies you'll like this whether you've seen Firefly or not but I really think that in order to enjoy the movie to its fullest you have to see Firefly first.	4.0	Serenity vs. Firefly	2013-11-14	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1Y7JKCYPRXPNW	"R. Whitelaw ""Rebel Broker"""	"What can I say? I am one of THEM.That makes me one of the masses of folks who have gotten a great deal of pleasure out of the Firefly series and the motion picture Serenity.It's all very hard to explain to someone who has not seen any of the shows or the movie. While the movie and series takes place in space, it is not about space. There are no aliens, and in fact you could take the space out of the show and still have the dedication you see from its proponents.It's really about independence and being a small fish in a large pond being overseen by some much larger fish who just want to ""Make things better"" for you - regardless of whether your idea of better and theirs are similar at all.It's about going against the grain and bristling at the influence of a huge bureaucracy that is too mesmerized by its own vision of the common good to critically examine what it has become.None of this requires that you must be a geek to enjoy these stories. You don't have to be able to recite all the episodes of Star Trek or have an opinion on whether the old or new Battlestar Galactica is better (all true geeks know the new BG is WAY better). If you have just been the poor schmuck standing on line at the DMV, you ""get"" the premise of a system that seems to work for and against you all at the same time. Crank that feeling you get up a couple 100 percent and your getting what firefly and serenity have to offer.In short, it is all worth your time. Every non-geek I have um... well... encouraged (Like locking them in a room with the DVD playing)... has been surprised by what they saw and thanked me for making them watch it.Take a chance to make the time for this movie.

This movie was a world wide victory for Firefly fans around the globe, who unfortunately abandoned the concept of going to the theater to see it in lieu of crappy video downloads on P2P and Bit Torrent sites.  Shame on you all, you should have gone to the movies to see this movie instead of sitting at your computer watching it like hermits. Nevertheless, despite the fans abandonment of the movie version at the movies, we now have it on DVD and those sales have prompted the studio to produce a Special Edition.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1D60G5IR9U5Z0	Ryan Wilkes	"Serenity is a film that will entrance any film buff--whether you're a fan of science fiction or not.  The stellar acting, skilled directing, and the riveting, mysterious plot grab the viewer in the first scene and nevet let you go until the finale.I first heard of the film last summer but the marketing was focused on fans of Firely--a show I had never heard of--so it really didn't register with me.  I was browsing online and saw some amazing reviews and my interest was piqued.At the heart of this film, are a crew of characters who are both full of bravery and pragmatism and an intriguing blend of idealism and cynicism.  The movie finds them after they have fought--and lost--a war for independence from a vast, intergalactic empire, which they rejected as tyrannical.  Their suspicions about the motivations and intentions of the ruling elite are borne out by the discovery of a terrible atrocity committed by the imperial government against its own citizens.  It was a crime borne out of a desire for harmony, but its results were ghastly and evil.The director of the film said about its characters, ""They are the people the Enterprise would have just flown by.""  It's an apt description of the type of people they are.  The fringes of the galaxy are their abode, and the ways of brigands and pirates are their methods.  In their souls, there lives a yearning for liberty tempered by the cruelty of war and a sense of justice they resist but in the end cannot ignore.Serenity is the best science-fiction film I've ever seen and will long be viewed by critics as one of the best action films of the decade."	5.0	"""She's tore, but she'll fly true . . ."""	2006-10-10	18	16	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1WMXIKVYBSCB1	samuraix98	After finishing the series I was eager to get more and more of the shows elegance and fun loving crew onto my TV. After the first watch through I'd say I was surprisingly unimpressed. Not with the quality of the movie and the amazingly spiced up special effects that such a Hollywood budget was given to Joss Whedon for his finale romp through the black. I was more unimpressed with the whole ending of it all. I'm still unclear as how this movie holds out alone and thats probably why it didn't get the numbers the execs wanted, but the movie with the show is an exceptional piece of sci fi all worth the small amount it's been on our radar.***SPOILER*** It truly does have a finally and an ending, especially when some key characters are no longer with us. That's the part that really irked me. As if and yes we all knew, Joss including more than anyone that there'll be no more Firefly, hence Serenity was the truthful end. That was the part that just made me unsettled. The movie it self has a well thought out premise and defiantly leads you in with learning more about the Firefly history. The last tid bit of the film does feel rushed, like I stated people just start falling down left an right. I am understanding the reasoning behind it, the peril that they where against is truly imminent and the notion that the crew was getting picked off like fleas made the action and the situation that much more real. I'd love to see a continuation of the Firefly series, perhaps with a different crew or a new method, but then again a new crew probably would grasp me into this universe as much as the true crew has done. That's what made me love this series, the people and their interactions. How everyone does play a role, whether small like a machinist or large like a captain. All pieces of the story are fun and awesome to watch. I do love that this was a show and a movie combined that I was able to experience. It's a great show and a great story.	4.0	Hard to be happy about the end of Firefly	2013-07-29	1	1	0

It's not just sci-fi; it's not just a western; it's not JUST anything.  Except a really good movie.  Although devoted fans of the TV show ""Firefly"" already know and love the characters in this film, it is not necessary to have advance knowledge to enjoy the story, to understand what is happening in the plot, and to fall in love with the characters.  ALL of the characters.  Joss Whedon writes characters who are multi-layered...no-one is just a bad guy or a good guy.  Every character can be appreciated on many levels, as can the story.  No, there aren't any aliens...although there are some scary characters who live on the outer edge of nowhere...but there are real people, living in a real world, having an adventure that will leave you breathless and wanting more!"	5.0	"""Serenity"" is the best movie I've seen this year!"	2005-10-02	17	15	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2PH6QJJCTUPF9	"Sandra J. Kozloff ""Firstkoz"""	I stumbled onto Firefly in a meander on the edge of the black looking for interesting Sci-Fi entertainment awhile ago.  Needless to say, the series was captivating and satisfying on every level.  I was sad to realize there would be no more episodic contributions, but had hopes for a feature film.  When Serenity was finally made and released in theaters, I was there on opening day.  I just fell back into the Whedon-Reality, without missing a beat in the action, humour, and heart of the characters and their story.  This movie brings on the action six-shooter style and never lets up. The quick wit and unique dialogue with the multi-cultural mix is there blazoning your brain with its cleverness - making you wish you could work words with such saucy deliveries.  The movie is the perfect accompaniment to the series.  Hopefully, there will be enough interest in the DVD and increased interest in Firefly that Whedon's (and our dream) will come true and allow more adventures of Mal and crew!

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1K94LXX833JTT	Sanpete	The setting, the plot, the look and effects, along with some of the characters, owe a lot to Star Wars.  The feel of the acting and the sense of humor, along with some of the characters, are very like writer/director Whedon's other work, including his best known, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  And, as in that series, there is a 17-year-old girl with superhuman gifts kicking human and monster butt with martial arts (though no vampires, per se).It works well, on the whole.  There's plenty of action, enough character development to be interesting, romance, pop philosophy of the kind you get in Star Wars and Star Trek, and a mix of moral ambiguities among strong moral values that's distinctively Whedon.  Some of the sentimentality stuck out enough to make me squirm a couple times, but it's handled with a leavening humor.  No need to say a lot more.  If you enjoyed Star Wars or Whedon's other work, you're likely to enjoy this.	5.0	Star Wars meets Buffy	2006-09-27	6	4	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A13WA3SCM778LO	SanteeFats	This is a movie that comes from the Firefly series. I think this is a very fine movie and that the series was way to good to have been cancelled. The casting is really good, the acting is also good, the writing is excellent, and while there is a lot of serious scenes there are also a lot of funny ones. Serenity survives on the outskirts of a society ruled by winners of a brutal war which most of the crew fought against. Nathan Fillon plays the captain, Gina Torres his number two. A Baldwin is in this but guess what? he is not related to those Baldwin's. His character is pretty mercenary and is usually only interested in money, sex and booze. Summer Glau is brain manipulated schizoid who can go from a rabbit to a wolverine in an instant. No one wants to mess with her in case she goes off!!	5.0	Great stuff	2013-07-19	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2IHPZIA4G4JWQ	santiago2274	The passion Joss Whedon, the film crew, and actors had for this movie, is the same thing Malcolm Reynolds has for his ship, Serenity.  You really follow this crew and see them as a family. You feel their joys, their fear, their sadness and their passions.The prologue in this movie is interesting for both the Firefly fan and the folk who never heard of it.  You don't have to see the Firefly DVD series to enjoy the movie.  From the prelude, the rest of the movie is a journey into this family's toughest trial yet.Check it out. It should be lesson to networks and movie studios alike. Make great characters, and a great story and people will watch it. But what does it take to make great characters and stories?  An excellent writer and time, time being the key.I used to be a really into sci-fi, and TV shows in general and after Firefly, nothing really seemed worth watching.Serenity doesn't have a feel of `just another episode.'  It stands alone and strong.This movie is the diamond in the rough. It blew my expectations out.	5.0	Serenity has plot?  Pretty definitely!!!	2005-10-04	7	6	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A7C6D03VK92F4	Sarah Kelley	this movie is about what happened in the firefly series after the show got cancelled. it had a big fan base, being a show created by joss whedon the buffy and angel creator, but had an unfortunate time slot, so it didnt have a chance to build a bigger fan base.its a sci-fi drama with comic elements and western and asian themes. i know that sounds strange but joss really pulled it off. its an awesome series that gets you hooked in the first episode.the basic premise for the show(firefly, where the whole thing started)is that earth was too small for all the people so they left and traveled until they found  more planets that they could colonize. there are two big central planets that are highly advanced and civilized and then a big bunch of other planets and the farther out you go the less civilized it gets.the major influences are asian and american because joss figured we two were the biggest cultures on earth and if we ever migrated off planet there are more of us than anyone else. you do see others from time to time,the russian mafia,british etc. anyway ,there was a big battle comparable to the big north/south gettysburg thing where they were trying to decide whether to have individual governments to run all the planets or just one big one for everyone located on the central planets.the main characters in this series were on the losing side ,the side of individual governments.they were a little bitter about it and the unified government kind of doesnt care about whats happening  on the outer planets and the main characters become smugglers.they pick up some passengers in the first episode, a priest, a doctor and a few others and the story begins. the doctor is smuggling his sister away from the alliance(main government people)because they were doing experiments on her in the genius school she was going to and then the rest of the crew gets involved when they find out.the movie serenity happens when the series ended, with them finding out why the government wants her back so badly.its really cool, a little scary, and pretty funny. i highly reccomend it and its better if you see the firefly episodes first, because in the movie they dont have alot of time for character development, and all the really funny stuff is in the episodes.also, the movie was intended to be the first of a trilogy, but they wont make the next one unless it makes a certain amount of money, but it ends in a way that if you never see another one the story is semi-satisfactorily ended.	5.0	gotta see!	2006-02-27	4	4	0

Joss Whedon can truly be happy about this movie. The movie had me laughing one minute, tense with anticipation the next, and then crying. Even through my tears this movie made me laugh constantly, Joss is a comic genius. He managed to get the feel of the show, put a darker twist on it, and then give it back to us for Christmas.

Can't bear to give it less than 4 stars, even though there were a few things that I didn't like - like the deaths of certain people, one especially . . . . it just wasn't right.  But then, Joss Whedon has a dirty habit of killing off beloved people in the last ""episodes"" of his serieses. And the contention at the beginning between Mal and Simon.  I mean, it was just like, boom, all of the sudden River saving the ship and expressing how she feels about the crew in the last Firefly episode is all but forgotten.  Alas.  But it worked.  Mal finding the thing that could help bring down the Alliance for good was a nice touch - though it would have worked better in a season two ;).

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3RUQO10JKY9NT	Scott Cameron	Firefly was a show that was broadcasted on the FOX Network in the fall of 2002 that sadly was canceled after only airing 11 of 14 episodes. I, sadly, missed the magic that was Firefly at the time as I was involved in the conflict in Afghanistan at the time.In 2005 I went to the dollar movie theater with a date to see a movie titled Serenity. I had not seen the television show and did not realize this movie was based on that show.When the movie began, I realized I was jumping into an already established story line yet never felt lost for one moment. I was instantly drawn into this strange new world of characters and their side stories. I have to say I tremendously enjoyed the interactions between all the main characters and their conflicting personalities. The story line was rich and detailed and kept my attention the entire length of the movie.The CGI was not what is expected of a big budget film but were passable and got the job done.The movie motivated me to see the entire run of FireFly. I realized that, going back to the movie, there were many jokes or references I had missed the first time due to not seeing the series prior yet,  it did not detract from my film watching experience. I was saddened watching the movie then the television series. This is a rich world Joss Whedon, the creator of Angel, Buffy, & director of the new upcoming Avengers movie, Introduced us to.I wish that the storyline would continue. I wish that there would be a sequel but there will be no more adventures of Serenity. The movie was not successful enough to warrant a sequel and the cast of the show have gone on to other projects since then.If you have not seen the  movie or the television series, I highly recommend you order both the movie and television series, pull up a blanket and bowl of popcorn and make a weekend of it.I received the blu ray/dvd/digital combo pack. It was filled with extras and features that comforted me once the end credits came onto the screen.	5.0	Must See & Buy Movie for Sci-Fi Fans	2012-02-07	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"If you are already a fan of Joss Whedon's tragically-cancelled sci-fi TV series, ""Firefly,"" you don't need to read my review - you're probably already a devoted fan and know the movie and all TV episodes by heart.If you're not already a fan of the aforementioned works and are considering whether to check them out, a few words of caution.  Diving into the TV series ""Firefly"" and this motion picture ""continuation"" ""Serenity,"" presents some risks.  Frustrated significant others will complain that you aren't paying attention to them anymore.  Friends will gripe that you didn't show up at the bar on Friday night.  You will have some sleepy days in the office because you stayed up to watch ""just one more episode"" the night before.  You may even find yourself cursing in Chinese when frustrated.But these risks are worth the rewards of diving into Joss Whedon's futuristic universe.  ""Serenity"" builds on the foundation laid by the TV series, and while it's better if you've seen the series, it's by no means essential to understand ""Serenity.""River Tam is a young girl who is recognized as a prodigy at an early age.  So the sinister ""Alliance,"" who rules over the federation of planets that arose out of the world wars that wracked Earth, took her for nefariouis purposes.  Let's take one of God's great creations and make a weapon out of her!  Her brother, Simon, is destined to be a successful, brilliant wealthy surgeon, but he throws it all away to break River out of her government lab/prison.This has consequences, not least being that the Alliance has more than a few nasty assassins at its beck and call.  Why kill River?  Because she knows Secrets that can harm the Alliance if the truth gets out (the Alliance likes to keep its People docile, ignorant, and tranquil).Unfortunately for the Alliance, Simon and River are in need of transport, and the ship they find (a ""Firefly""-class ship called ""Serenity"" - get it?) is crewed by folks who cannot under any circumstances be described as docile, ignorant, or tranquil.Led by Capt. Mal Reynolds, the crew of ""Serenity"" is classic-Whedon:  lovable, sarcastic, witty, dangerous, and just-a-mite scruffy.  Reynolds is a survivor of the last band of rebels who took on the Alliance and lost, and let's just say he carries a grudge and a few chips on his shoulder.  The rest of the cast has its own sets of idiosyncrasies and lovable traits . . . this is a cast of fully-realized, three-dimensional characters.One of the disadvantages you have when a TV series is adapted to the Big Screen is scope.  While the budget is bigger, the special effects better, and the writing often amazing, you still just don't have the luxury of time that you do in a series.  You have to make hard choices -- what story are you going to tell, and which characters do and do not fit into that primary story?  As a result, some beloved characters from the series are relegated to more supporting roles -- they get their moments, to be sure, but little more.For a well-written story, this is not a bad thing, just unfortunate.  Fortunately, Whedon and his team are great writers, so even the little moments for the ""supporting"" characters are a riot.  But the story does focus primarily on two characters -- Mal and River.  In ""Serenity,"" Mal is a bit darker, a bit more scarred than he was in ""Firefly.""  Sure, he's got his trademark wit, but we explore his pain (and his unending capacity for it) a bit deeper here.  And that's wonderful, because Mal is a great character.We also see a lot more of River in the movie.  In the series, River's story was always hinted at, but you could see that her story was something the writers wanted to weave gradually throughout the series as it evolved.  So there were many episodes where we only got hints and snippets of River and her potential.  ""Serenity"" dives into her story with a belly flop, and believe me, it's one dark tale.Grittier, edgier, and more violent than the TV series, ""Serenity"" is an excellent adaptation to the big screen of one of the little screen's greatest triumphs and tragedies.  Check it out, but don't say I didn't warn you."	5.0	"""Serenity"" keeps the signal alive -- story focuses on Mal and River"	2006-03-20	13	12	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3PIOZGOTK49FR	"Scott Valentine ""Adobe Community Professional..."	I already have two copies of this on DVD, including the Special Edition release. So, I'll write this for folks in a similar situation who know the material and story, and are just interested in the BR transfer.The visuals are gorgeous! While not as gritty througout as the series, the feel is still there. Some sections look a little sterile on my smaller Samsung HDTV, but on the larger Panasonic plasma, everything looks very consistent. There was no discernible jitter, and no oversharpened effect as with some other titles.I'm not sure the audio got anything dramatic done to it. It seemed exactly the same as on the standard-def DVDs, but that was great by itself.Unfortunately, I haven't gone through the extras yet, so I don't know if there is anything different there. I suspect this is exactly the same as the standard release.This disc started up and played wonderfully on my Samsung 5500, though there is a quirk where the opening Universal titles are repeated because Joss used it to fade into the actual print.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A26V7D68M30DPN	SDAJumpmaster	Serenity, the name of both the first and final installments of the Firefly series, is a fantastic movie.  If you're into films that appeal to most men: war movies, action, westerns, sci-fi, comedies, then you'll like this show and I recommend it without reservation, but I also recommend watching the entire series (14 episodes)first; I saw the movie before I had ever heard of the TV Show, and it was entertaining, but I felt as though I was outside of an inside joke.  After watching the rest of the story, the movie is the appropriate capstone.	5.0	I wanna be like Mal	2007-01-04	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3FNMXUTYOJEHX	Sean Foushee	When Joss Whedon's Firefly aired on Fox in 2002 it was at a time in my life where work dominated everything and TV was a distant thought.  It wasn't until Christmas 2005 that a friend of mine told me about the series when I mentioned that I was interested in buying the DVD of the movie Serenity, that unfortunately had a theatrical run in the last month of my wife's pregnancy and 2 hours at the theatre was not the best use of my time.  At the time of Serenity's release I had no idea the series and movie were connected, and had it not been for my friend's suggestion I would have bought the DVD of Serenity and been left completely confused.Anyone considering watching Serenity should take the time and buy Firefly: The Complete Series here on Amazon (best $40 you'll spend on entertainment).  Think of the series DVDs as a 14 part prequel to Serenity, a chance to dip your toe in the vast 'verse Joss Whedon created and the backstory of some of the complex characters that call Serenity home.  Serenity begins shortly after the end of the series and while at first the interaction between some of the crew, Mel in particular, seem harsh and uncharacteristic (especially after watching the series) you begin to understand that the untold story between the series and the movie took a terrible toll on the crew of Serenity.  This story is told without any regard to someone who's never seen the original TV series so I again highly recommend buying the Firefly series before embarking on Serenity's feature voyage.As a newcomer to this 'verse I feel sad to know that the 14 episodes+1 movie that were some of the best storytelling and cinematography to ever grace the small or big screen might never have another chance on either venues.  The camera work in Firefly/Serenity remind me of the revisioned Battlestar Galactica series on the Sci-Fi network (the series is most likely where Ronald Moore and Co. got their 'documentary' ideas from) and really help put you into the story.  The movie is shot in such a way that you're drawn in, instead of the cold staged shots typical of big productions, Serenity is more organic which brings a sense of realism to the characters and their plight.Everyone who is a fan of sci-fi will love this movie and the Firefly series, but the real gem in Joss' storytelling is anyone, no matter what genre appeals to them, can find themselves at home aboard Serenity.	5.0	Best Show I Never Saw	2006-02-03	10	8	2

The best escapist good time movie science fiction isn't that deep, it's just the Western set in the future.  This highly underrated television series (you'll like the movie better if you buy the Firefly television series DVD collection first, you only have a season to see, it didn't last long), included a marginally plausible future universe that allowed for a Western, post-Civil War look and feel, and once you surrender to the logic and physics problems, it's a totally internally consistent fictional setting.  The characters are interesting, pretty well developed, creating very entertaining teamwork challenges.  Like a lot of science fiction, we get a subtle anti-racist, pro-feminist set of sub-themes, which isn't at all preachy.

Of particular interest to fans of the show, it nonetheless stands well on its own as a fast-paced sci-fi drama with a droll touch of humor. The heroes are a compelling mix of misfits--some stoic; some ironic; some brilliant and talented; some less so--and all share a bond forged from living together in a dangerous and unsettled world aboard a rather decrepit spaceship, Serenity.  These are characters you can care about and root for (played deftly by interesting, appealing actors), and the special effects and action in the film keep it visually interesting.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A13UAIE3K517CQ	sft	Joss Whedon's space adventure ticks pretty much all the right boxes: it's sharp, funny, thrilling, and intelligent. He sets out to entertain and does so from start to finish, never allowing himself to take things too seriously, and never patronising his audience.To be honest, there's nothing new here, but it's done with such esprit and flair that its derivative nature is forgivable: This is homage rather than lack of imagination. If, however, Whedon had managed to come up with a more original story this would have been a 5-star movie.BTW, look out for references to other blockbusters including Blade Runner, the Indiana Jones and Star Wars series, along with many others. Even Kill Bill gets a nod.	4.0	I could stand to hear a little more too! (Watch closely and you'll get it.)	2009-12-18	2	1	1

It's blend of SciFi action, oddball humor, and quirky yet warm characters makes it a great show and film for any SciFi\Fantasy fan. I would recommend watching the full TV show series before watching Serenity.The movie was made to tie up the plot of the now cancelled show as best as possible, and without having watched the show, the movie will not be as easy to follow.In regards to the distributor, I purchased this BluRay used, and it came well packaged and in mint condition.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A149PLF9RX9DMX	Shanna R. Mullen	"A couple of months ago, I TiVoed Firefly when it came on the SciFi channel because I'd heard it was interesting.  After getting around to watching the series, I couldn't see what all the hoopla was about--the premise was interesting but it was ""okay"" at best.  To me, the metaphor is way too literal--sure, the concept that 500 years in the future if people from Earth are on other planets not everything will be all bright and ""shiny"" (heh) is great, but the phony ""western"" accents and dusty towns where people wore cowboy hats and frilly dresses just grated on my nerves.  (Also, I had to watch the first half of the first episode I had TiVoed twice, finding that I had missed almost all of it because it didn't hold my attention.)  So on to the movie--I'd heard it was ""so"" funny and great, so I wanted to see it, thinking since it was released to the general public it would be more polished.  But while watching it, I began to realize it was just like watching a long episode of the televison show--it didn't really have a ""movie""-like plot at all.  To tell the truth, there were two episodes of the TV show that I enjoyed more than the movie--episode 12, ""Heart of Gold,"" and episode 10 (but the last episode filmed, as they were aired out of order), ""Objects in Space""--especially the latter.  ""Objects in Space,"" I presume, was made when they knew the show was being cancelled and therefore should be the jumping off point for the movie, yet River, more or less the focal point of the show and movie, I found much more impressive in ""Objects in Space"" than Serenity.  To me, Serenity seemed like it was a TV movie appeasing fans who wanted to see more of the show, rather than a big-screen movie released to the general public.  It's great for the fans who wanted to see more, but to me, it seems it would have been better for those who hadn't seen the show especially had they kept what fans saw as the charm of the show but given it a more cohesive plot too.  To conclude, my advice?  If you've seen Firefly and haven't seen Serenity, see it.  If you haven't seen either but want to see Serenity, well, see it.  If you've seen Serenity and now want to see Firefly, again, see it.  If you haven't seen either, but just want to see what I, personally, recommend, maybe catch episodes 10 and 12 when they play a Firefly marathon on SciFi.  Not the greatest things ever but interesting."	3.0	This was released in theaters?	2006-03-23	20	6	14

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	Little surprise to see all the wheedling five-star votes for this gritty sci-fi thriller. This is no breezy glide through the outer world. In its unusual blend of sharp-shooting space cowboys and oriental mythology, it yokes together something proprietary to its fantastic world, something that has the electricity to make it all seem worthwhile.The scene is 500 years from now. A bunch of renegades fly around in space, spewing witty banter more than anything more productive -- but really, the dialogue is sharp throughout. Abroad this ship is a psychic girl, who for her dazzling powers had been apparently captured and trained by the 'Alliance' (those big bad unseen powers in charge of the universe, as usual) in a top secret program to manufacture human weapons, but has since been rescued by her brother and brought back to the ship.As you can probably tell, the Alliance must now spread its whiz-bang tentacles and repossess her. Which in turn sets us up for a lickety-split chase-athon of a flick, with all its twists and turns and bone-crunching bursts of martial art. Surprisingly, the actors are pretty confident in their parts, which is impressive considering that I had never seen any of them before. Particular praise for the captain of the ship, the psychic girl, and the lead operative of the Alliance who sports a British accent, but that's eminently forgivable.Strongly recommended if you are looking to snazz up a slow weekend and have had patience for Starwars type fare.	4.0	TOTAL RECALL MEETS STARWARS: EXPLOSIVE COWBOY RIDE THRU SPACE	2006-02-19	9	7	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2KZRP3JFD91OF	Sheldon Ellman	Serenity concludes and wraps up of most of the story lines from the show Firefly.  It also explains some of the premises the show was based on.  If you are a fan of the show, as I am, you will like this, but it could have been a little more inclusive, as Ron Glass's Preacher is never completely explained.  There is a hook at the end for a sequel.  It has the same feel and action in a longer format, so more development of plot and characters are possible.  The added discs provide even more insight and behind-the-scenes looks. This is a must have, if you have the Firefly series.

I myself had never seen nor heard about the story of Serenity before watching the film in theaters, but it caught my interest so much that I purchased the series Firefly that very night.  Now that I have seen the series and the movie once again, I have to admit my understanding of the film has skyrocketed.For the avid fans, this is a solid representation of Firefly and it appears it was an easy transition.  Every element that is loved by the fans - the wit, the relationships, the smart action - is embedded in Serenity.  Then again, if you are an avid fan, you already know this.For those, like me, who have no idea what all this jargin means I think you will still enjoy the film.  Granted, you may be 'ignorant' of the significance of many of the events that occur, but that shouldn't prevent you from being entertained.  You may even end up like me - leaving a positive review after committing hours of watching Firefly the series and Serenity multiple times.	5.0	Browncoats and pre-browncoats friendly film...	2005-12-26	16	16	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2V5HMKYATEC9R	"Shodanjon ""shodanjon"""	First, let me say that I missed Firefly when it first showed up on Fox. I found the dvd set and I absolute loved the story line, characters and universe. It's a kind of western in space, focusing on the bad guys. Except that the bad guys lost a war, fly in a space ship, shoot six-guns and are on the outer fringe of a great society. It doesn't take long to get into this and Whedon (Buffy and Angel television shows) does a great job with the characters and the stories. The characters are unique and very human. Each has their own backstory and motivations yet they seem very much like ordinary people. This is due to their individual talents as actors and Whedon's own skill in using his actors.It's not at all necessary to watch the dvds to love the movie. There is just enough back story in the movie so that one can get caught up quickly and understand what drives the story. The movie still moves very fast and is a bit more complicated than all of the other big screen sci-fi movies that came out this year.If you're a fan of Firefly then this review won't be much more than a chorus of the praises you're already heard or sung yourself. If you haven't seen it, please do so. You'll see a greatly entertaining movie with a lot of action and humor and some sad bits, too. This movie just rocks and it shows exactly how every big budget action movie should contect with it's audience. It took a gang of misfits rescued from a cancelled television show to get it right.	5.0	Terrific movie - lots of fun and a great story	2005-10-14	9	6	3

Proof of my conviction: If you want any of my Firefly/Serenity DVD's - and I have them ALL - you will have to tear them from my cold dead hands OR show me a signed contract proving COMPLETE financial backing to Joss's next episode(s)!	5.0	Serenity NOW!!!	2008-01-07	2	1	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3HI5LDLOS2A8A	SicVic	"This was my first introduction to the Firefly universe created by Joss Whedon. I recall seeing commercials for the series when it first came out and thinking, ""Oh boy, another Farscape clone/ripoff. PASS"". Forward to three months ago when I decided to rent the DVD, thinking how bad it was going to be. I was utterly shocked. I know that I am hooked on a movie when I go through all the DVD selections (Special Features, Making of..., Gag Reels, etc.) after watching it for the first time. Now, this movie seems like a love it or hate it movie. For the Firefly familiars they loved it. For the uninitiated they either loved it, were confused, or hated it. This movie appealed to me because I am, by and far, a huge Science Fiction fan. I loved it, I guess, for its originality and unique vision. Also for its characters. I plan on buying this DVD and the first season of Firefly, as recently Universal HD (channel) has started running Firefly eps in the order they were intended. I saw the pilot for the first time Sunday, and all I can say is that I hope a sequel to Serenity is made, bar some revival of the series. This series is too good to have received such poor treatment from Fox. I feel terrible for not giving it the chance it deserved back when the series started. Here's hoping it recovers."	5.0	Great movie, even for a newcomer.	2006-09-27	4	3	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1T3BTOG2FSUJB	SimonB	Right off the bat, let me make myself clear - I'm a huge Firefly fan, so I guess this won't be the most objective review in the 'verse, but it's from the heart.I was deeply saddened when the superb FIREFLY series was cancelled and was keen for the new Serenity film as a chance to enjoy another adventure with the crew and ship I'd come to love.I wasn't disappointed. It's a great film - Sci-fi that's cleverly written, has a real heart to it, a great cast of characters with real chemistry between them, and a wonderful story (works better if you've seen Firefly in my mind, but not essential).Sure, this won't be everyone's cup of tea - if we all liked the same stuff this would be a boring world - but I'd urge people to try it - more people seem to like Serenity than don't, and you could be missing out on something you really enjoy. See it for yourself and make your own minds up.As a FIREFLY fan however - I really enjoyed the film and it was great that (should it be the last) it does serve well as a valedictory piece whilst still leaving ample room for more. And though there were moments I disliked (no spoilers here though) on the whole I came out feeling a buzz and excitement I've not felt from a film in a long time. And sure, the movie didn't do that well in the cinemas, but I think poor marketing is to blame, and it now appears to be enjoying the success it deserves on DVD.Here's hoping we'll get SERENITY II someday soon!	5.0	SIMPLY SHINY!	2006-09-01	0	0	0

It's a fun, exciting sci-fi spectacular that's a must watch for any Firefly fan yet still accessible to those that have never seen the TV show.  The distinct western feel, interesting dialect, and the quirks of the characters sets this apart from many other contemporary sci-fi movies.If you already own the original Serenity DVD there isn't much point in getting this Collector's Edition DVD.  The packaging is nice and there are some extras, but the extras aren't momentous enough to justify purchasing the movie again if you already own it.  On the other hand if you don't already own Serenity then you might as well dish out the couple bucks extra and get this over the original DVD.	5.0	Great Movie, Decent Collector's Edition	2011-03-08	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AI0KXH1O95X0H	"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles"""	"Simply put, Serenity is the movie version of the TV series ""Firefly."" It puts together all the loose ends that the series left dangling after only 14 episodes and nary a season (only 11 of these episodes were aired before being cut off.) In Serenity, we can see the arc of what ""Firefly"" could have been, and in my opinion, much more.Since Serenity is the movie and the culmination (?), it is only proper that it be given the cinematic touch. And yet, even on the big screen, its TV origin is still very apparent. The Firefly cargo ship Serenity is still as clunky as it was as shown in the tube. There's not much change in the costume, and even most of the sets still look like they've been picked up from the scrapyard. I am not saying this in disgust, but with affection because it is the characters that I have come to love after all. Come to think of it, there is something in Serenity that makes me think more of home than I would the Starship Enterprise. Perhaps this is one of the formulas that make the movie work. Like what I said in my review of ""Firefly,"" great science fiction doesn't have to be high-budgeted with wall to wall CGI (although it does help tremendously.)Most sci-fi films tend to take the genre into some mythical dimension. ""Battlestar Galactica"" is one such example of sci-fi that mixes myth and science in that it purports the human origin as having come from another planet (which is probably true.) ""Star Wars"" is another classic example in that it believes in a universal Force that is in all things, and that the right WILL triumph over the wrong. The Star Trek series, while primarily adventure-oriented, also sometimes have this tendency for the ethereal: note Spock's resurrection in the Star Trek film ""The Search for Spock,"" or even the Voyager satellite that achieved massive knowledge and became more than just a machine in Star Trek-The Motion Picture.""Firefly"" and ""Serenity,"" on the other hand, beg to be different. In the Whedon `verse, aliens are conspicuously absent, there are no blackholes that threaten ships, no exploding stars, no technobabble to make things more ""authentic,"" no warping here and there, and no extinct alien civilization that leaves us mystified as to what might have caused their demise (Babylon 5.) Instead of all the above, we are given the gritty Frontier life in the outer edges of known space where the long arm of the Central law is not yet fully established. Sounds familiar? Fans of ""Firefly"" know that this has strong parallels with the American Western frontiers from two centuries ago. The Frontier overtones are so strong that even our heroes still carry guns, instead of the usual lasers. The captain himself wears pants that look like they came from the old American Civil War days of the 1860s.Enough said. The plot: Simon and River Tam, brother and sister, are on the run from the Alliance, the central government of the planets five hundred years from now. River was part of a mad experiment by the higher echelons of power that turned her (and maybe even others) into a kickboxing and mind-reading assasin. The siblings are hiding under the wings of the titular ship Serenity. Their destination: as far out as they can go. The ship is captained by Malcom Reynolds (the good-looking and therefore popular-among-women Mr. Nathan Fillion,) an embittered sergeant from the Independent Faction that once fought the Alliance for, well, Independence. On their tail is a nameless Operative, a superior speciman of an assasin, out to take River back at all costs. Of course, there's much more than what I had just said. Into the storyline are thrown a mixture of interesting characters such as a Companion (a certified pleasure-giver in the sexual way,) a Christian priest, a universal hacker and the loyal Serenity crew. Plus, who can forget the Reavers, for what would the fringes of space be like without them?Perhaps the thing that makes ""Serenity"" exciting is the way Captain Reynolds outwitted the frighteningly cool but ultimately disgusting Operative (played to perfection by Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor) not only once, but thrice. As a personal opinion, I like the fight scenes between these two the best. If romance can have electricity between two characters, so can a brawl between two fighters.As I have mentioned in my review of ""Firefly,"" the story of the Whedon `verse has much potential. I believe that many of you think that ""Serenity"" is a wrap-up of ""Firefly."" Excuse me for saying that I just don't think this is so. For starters, I find it very hard to believe that Mal's broadcast of the SIGNAL can even slightly affect the tight grip of the Alliance government. But the underground movement is bound to be moved for sure, and therein lies another branch of story in the Whedon `verse. And what of the Reavers? They deserve better spotlight for what they really are. If Reavers get killed all the time, why does it seem like they're not diminishing? As for River, what is the real purpose of the Alliance for her? Why the ghastly experiments to create more dangerous assasins when Operatives could have done very well? Questions, questions, and further questions......., that is the potential of the Whedon `verse that I am talking about.Overall, ""Serenity"" is the worthy movie of ""Firefly."" It should be for it is what Browncoats fans expect. For the Firefly-uninitiated, it will still pass as a very entertaining movie. Script is crisp and no nonsense. Jokes sometimes fall lame, but otherwise good-natured. Good story pacing and always commanding attention. Mr. Whedon's efforts to avoid plot cliches are very evident. Good CGI concept especially the scene where the Alliance and the Reavers spaceships come face to face beneath the ion cloud. The ""Leaf on the Wind"" sequence is also nicely done, and is one of the scenes that lift ""Serenity"" to a grander scale. But the Chinese they blurt out!! If Shakespeare were Chinese, he'd be turning in his grave right now!!Anyway, just sit back and enjoy this sci-fi flick. Sure, some people may not like it (a friend of mine didn't like ""Firefly"" but liked ""Serenity"",) because it really looks like a very B film. Plus, it doesn't have that mythical quality that most people yearn from the mysteries of space. But just for the film's adventure story and the love that Mr. Joss Whedon has put into it, makes the film highly watchable."	5.0	Highly Likeable Sci-Fi Flick That Is Highly Original In Its Own Sense	2007-01-05	6	6	0

This movie has a great deal of feedback from people on Amazon, who love it too...but why? I thought this movie sucked.I like Science Fiction and grew up reading Larry Niven, watching the original Star Wars trilogy, loving Aliens (perhaps best sci-fi movie ever), and playing a lot of ""Star Frontiers,"" which is D&D; in space (I played A LOT of normal AD&D; too).Now I have never seen Firefly, but this is a movie that should be at least good on it's own merits somewhat right? But it's not, it's really really bad. My gut even wants to give it one star, but that should be saved for really really bad movies, I could at least sit through this.First, it's a diluted, dilapidated version of Star Wars. I won't accuse it of being a rip-off or a copy (and I don't think it was intentionally-although others may know better) However, the captain was so much a crappy copy of Han Solo, even the clothes and the pistol belt and well, just about everything, it was painful to watch. Of course that role of the rouge (hidden idealist) captain is almost an archetype now, which makes it even more silly and what's even worse is the archetype big strong loud guy on the ship (name is not worth remembering) and the token black girl (wait, no, they're not worse, the captain is the worst offender). More than that, What's with the contemporary clothes, ESPECIALLY the Hawaiian shirt worn by the pilot, how silly is that? Reminds me of Dex's silly dinner in ""Attack of the Clones,"" and the stupid cigarettes and other references to current popular culture.Next, The acting was poor, and so where the props.The technology was silly and there are more efficient ways to do certain things with current technology today. I am talking here about certain vehicles and weapons and communication, etc.And finally, the thing I think that might have been the dumbest were the ""Reavers."" There is no explanaition given (I doubt there is a good one anywhere) about how people that have gone so mad that the cut their faces, use projectile weapons that fire blades and spiked balls (in an age of inter-planetary space flight)and fight and act like Neanderthals can operate, pilot, or even maintain, space ships...yet they're some terrible force.The rest of the movie was more passable...I am welcome to comments to open my eyes to the light...but I can't imagine what they could be, and I know I am not alone because I read a few other reviewers that had similar complaints as mine coming in."	2.0	Reality Check for me/them?.... a horrid movie	2010-11-28	38	3	35

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	Creator Joss Whedon's science-fiction Firefly (Whedon's third series after Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) was cancelled after only 11 of the 14 episodes had aired on the Fox network back in 2002. However, if you want to see a movie about this cancelled TV series you've come to the right place. That is what Serenity is. It is not a stand-alone film that's easy or desirable for the general public to watch whether rented or purchased.I sure didn't enjoy it. It was all over the place jumping around, difficult to follow, with a kind of Han Solo/Indiana Jones space-cowboy lead character. Fans of the show clearly are not finding it hard to follow and are enjoying Serenity thoroughly. Fans are rejoicing to get the loose ends of the cancelled series tied up in this movie. But I picked up this movie thinking that the movie was a new sci-fi theatrical release with no prior TV history. My bad.Serenity is a movie for the disappointed fans (and apparently there are a lot of them) of what was perhaps a decent TV series. I wouldn't really know about that though because I never watched Firefly. There is a big diversion between fans and critics. Fans say it was unjustly and prematurely cancelled. But the other side of the coin is that the quality of the show was conspicuous by its cancellation.So fans, please don't be mad at me for this negative review...rather appreciate the warning for naive, impulse movie purchasers like myself: Viewers that were not Firefly fans should proceed with caution.	2.0	Looks Like Bad TV.

The plot revolves around the search for River by a smooth, evil operative of the Alliance and the flight of Captain Malcolm Reynolds, River, and the Serenity's rollicking crew of misfits.  It's a dark melancholy movie in many ways, but with lots of good dialogue and gritty, blood-soaked action. I was reminded a bit of ""Batman Begins"" because of its dark side. The characters are well drawn and distinctive -- or at least well drawn for those of us familiar with the TV series.""Serenity"" is a low budget movie compared to other space operas like ""Star Wars"" but the special effects were impressive nevertheless and the story was a lot better than the simplistic comic-book plots of other space operas.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ACVQ6OMN2T773	S. Mayo	Not bad, not fantastic. Flaws: the plot hook on which the entire story ultimately depends, is a clumsy, entirely unbelievable macguffin (which I won't explain, as it's a spoiler. Hint: that's not how experimental research is ever done, in anyone's universe.) The scripting and camera work is occasionally over the top - I'm sorry, you can't make something dramatic by focusing in on bare feet, walking on a floor. But the acting was ok and if you ignore the over the top premise, the movie moves along well. It looked to me like the central actress did her own fight scenes and pulled them off pretty well, and she did a decently disturbing psycho.I never saw Firefly, so I probably missed some of the emotional impact. There were some very funny lines. Decent late night popcorn-muncher.Addendum: Having now seen all of Firefly (GREAT series!), this movie looks better than it did. It was clearly an attempt to finish telling the story the Firefly series was setting up to tell, and it does it nicely. An absolute must-have for the Firefly fans.	3.0	Not bad	2006-05-30	19	5	14
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AR1NP84PU84D4	S. Melvin	...falling to the eventual demise of poor decision making by large movie houses that fail to see a good thing when they have one.That, however, was to the benefit of all Firefly followers around the world, as it allowed Mr Joss Whedon to create and produce this very entertaining movie as a means of bringing the short lived series to a close.  The series, as many know, was cancelled by a particular production house, because viewership wasn't what they expected.  Really?  The tons of fans would beg to differ.  They allowed some fairly aweful stuff to stay on television during the same period and yet this series was canned.  Makes no sense......but alas, this is about the movie Serenity, not the overall issues with the franchise that singlehandedly killed it.  Serenity picks up where Firefly left off - sort of.  We finally learn about River's amazing skill set.  We see the &#34;man&#34; moving in to catch, return or kill her to prevent the secret from getting out - and we see human perseverance at its finest...or as it is well put in the film - &#34;can't stop the signal.&#34;That was the true beauty of this series/movie.  Not the sci-fi/western mix (which was an awesome concept btw), but the fact that this crew of &#34;outlaws&#34; did whatever it took to survive and did it without hurting innocent people.  Sure a few laws were broken, but when the laws are designed to make anything and everything you want to do illegal, then the people will revolt.  Besides, the characters, even the Companion, were all written and designed to be good people with morals, integrity, and conviction.  From all walks of life - preacher, companion, doctor, veteren, and gun nut - this movie had it all.And then, there is River - the main purpose behind this ragtag band of merry spacefarers travels through the universe (she's the girl on the cover art).  She is a young, gifted girl who was taken from her home by the corporation to exploit her mental capacity and refine her into a weapon - well, like all good weapons, sometimes they backfire, especially when mishandled.  And River puts that premise forward in some of the best possible ways during this movie.  Without spoiling anything - just wait for the final fight scene that she is in.Overall, this movie was a great conclusion to an excellent series that ended far, far too early.  The likelihood of this series coming back, especially with Joss Whedon's schedule (not to mention all the actors) is infinitesimally small, but that's all that most Browncoats (true fans of this series - and also the name of the resistance forces during the &#34;Great War&#34;) need to carry on...a little hope can go a long way.  Watch the movie - stream the movie - borrow the movie...or simply buy it from here.  If you like sci-fi or even westerns...you'll enjoy this one!	5.0	I am a leaf...	2013-10-08	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A36NJ2TVRG44PC	S. Mertink	"When I found out that the TV show ""Firefly"" was cancelled I was very disappointed, so was my husband. We really liked the show. So we were VERY excited and happy to hear about the new movie (with the original cast from the TV show) ""SERENITY"".I am not a huge science fiction fan, nor do Westerns in particular grab my attention (except a few great ones) - but you don't have to be a fan of either to enjoy this movie.It is a fun, witty, well-written and acted and fast-paced movie that I would rate as one of the top 5 movies of 2005 (for me, it was number 1). I really enjoyed it.What I liked so much about ""Serenity"" is the blend of wild west atmosphere and space adventures- it's totally unexpected but actually works well; the blend of witty dialogue and action -packed scenes. This movie has a message, a good one at that, but it does not hit you over the head with - unlike so many other movies these days.You do not have to see the TV series ""Firefly"" to like the movie- but I would recommend it, because it adds a lot of depth and understanding to this movie.All in all, wonderful movie - give it a try!"	5.0	Great movie- not just for Scifi fans	2006-02-23	7	6	1

When I first got my HD Player 11/07, this was the first movie I purchased (and watched) and was blown away by the new depths of detail and color.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3HPMIQL7VKDP1	Socrets	What can I say? Serenity is not your average Science Fiction movie. For starters, it's a movie spawned from a huge fan movement (Browncoats) of a (undeservedly)cancelled television show by Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel). In my opnion, it's a movie made specifically for the fans because of all the different references to past episodes but that doesn't mean some guy who's bored on a Friday night won't enjoy it. While the graphics aren't the same as LotR or Star Wars (New Trilogy) but the story is still compelling and even though the dialogue sounds a bit awkward at times (it's still better than the new Star Wars trilogy at any right), it stays true to the universe. The acting is good, you can get a sense of the characters and their developement over the course of the movie.	5.0	Perfectly Serene	2006-06-28	8	6	2

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2UNYLCWQRCEG2	Soloufein	Serenity has a grittiness about it that is absent in many science fiction movies. The realm of science fiction being concerned with the future and improved technology normally carries a progressive message and constructs utopian societies in which people are 'better' than real-life people are today. In serenity there does exist such a society but it is counterbalanced with the relative anarchy and savagery of the outer worlds, this is a refreshingly realistic viewpoint in my opinion. The crew of the film come across as real people, not at all like the crew of a Star Trek vessel anyway, the captain is abrasive, ruthless and capable of immoral actions yet is also heroic.The film itself is concerned with this question of the scientific enhancement of our quality of life, the dangers of what might happen when authorities try to re-make humanity into a less violent form. The question of individual freedom versus Authoritarian benevolence. The film does a splendid job of bringing together many interesting characters (none more interesting than The Operative played brilliantly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and locations and breathing life into this interesting world. The effects may look a little amateurish at times though the interplanatary scenes are beautifully rendered. The story is a real gripper, at the part were the Reaver fleet emerges from the nebula i found myself cheering out loud. Packed with suspense, mystery, camraderie and even quieter moments of mystical awe (during the awesomely understated scenes on the surface of Miranda where they discover the bizarre and horrifying secret) this movie excels in every area and i was really surprised at how good it was.	5.0	Serenity is a hugely enjoyable film	2006-04-29	8	7	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2FPD5N9PM5I6X	Sonja Foust	Because I've seen the Firefly series, I really enjoyed this movie. It tied up a lot of things that were never really explored in the series and also brought out some great universal truths. I appreciated the balance between dark and light. A witty line makes all the difference in a story about destroyed races and death. Firefly and Serenity never take themselves to seriously, but still get their messages across.All that said, not sure I'd be a fan if I hadn't seen the series. Some of the characters could have used some more development, but there just wasn't time to develop such a huge cast in such a short span of time.	5.0	Great conclusion	2006-09-21	4	3	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A23VZYB672MB8Q	"Spider and I ""single individual"""	I have to qualify this review with the caveat that I spent a lot of time with the Firefly TV series DVDs before ever viewing this feature. So if you're new to the Firefly universe, I'm not sure how useful my perspective on this film will be to you. From that backdrop, having listened to all the comments from Joss Whedon about what he wanted the show to be, how he adapted it to make it palatable for the network execs, etc., I was not that surprised at the difference in tone from the TV show to the movie. Still, it was a bit jarring at first. The main characters are all a bit darker, a bit colder and harder, than in the TV series. There is an element of warm whimsy in the TV show that is lacking here; or at least it's buried deeper. Of course, it could all be explained by the passage of time and the fact that they've all been cooped up on the ship together for that much longer, and have been having a tough time finding work, etc. At any rate, I felt like I had to make a sort of shift in my perspective, view these characters from a slightly different place, before I could relate to them as the same people I'd grown attached to in the TV show. Once I made that adjustment -- and I really didn't pull it off until the second time viewing the movie -- I found myself in more or less familiar territory. The clever, witty dialog, fine acting with great chemistry between characters, live-action feel with ambient lighting and hand-held camera shots, extending even into the excellent but unobtrusive special effects. One thing I found puzzling was the absence of the western element; as far as I can remember, there was not a single horse in this movie. Puzzling because that was Joss Whedon's original idea for the show -- a Sci-Fi Western. But anyhow, it's a really great story, very well told. I don't think I'll be spoiling anything for anybody if I say that some of the ongoing threads from the TV series will be tied up here. I think the tying-up of the old threads is very artfully and seamlessly integrated with the present very compelling story, but my perspective may be skewed on that since I'm so steeped in the old threads. Anyhow, not all the old threads are tied up, and that's good news for fans because it means more is coming; let's hope JW finds a way to make it happen.	4.0	Different but Still Good	2006-03-13	3	3	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A256TQWCTDLK5Y	Sportyyyy	As I rarely write reviews, I felt compelled to add my two cents for this movie; which I saw after viewing the dvd series.  I'm not into Buffy/Angel/other Joss Wheddon shows, so I was a bit of a skeptic while watching the series.  The humor was biting, the action plausible, the characters developed and the plot was ORIGINAL.  God it was great seeing a sci-fi flim that didn't rely on crappy dialogue (Star Wars II), a boring storyline (Star Wars I), and overly dramatic theme music (Star Wars III).Without taking anything away from Wheddon's stand-alone movie, you will appreciate it more after seeing the series and that is most definitely not a chore.I really can't pick a favorite character because they interact so well together- each one has humorous/kick-ass moments.  Obviously, I'm eagerly awaiting word of the sequel/continuation of the series and anyone who enjoys this movie will be too.	5.0	More original, more character driven, and more plot then any other sci-fi film	2005-12-31	11	10	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	If you love Firefly then it's a given you will love Serenity. It's an extension of the series and has all the same feel and pacing that you would expect from the series. If you aren't familiar with Firefly it's is a space opera kind of science fiction (high adventure in space) that combines the classic cowboy show type elements into a really neat package. It may seem like a weird combination, but it works in a really nice way. It's best for you new folk to check out Firefly first, then come back to me about Serenity.Now Serenity, like I said before, is very much an extension of Firefly. You get a good mix of plot twists, comical moments, and drama peppered throughout a story. This particular chapter starts off simple then opens up pretty big. One thing I notice though was it felt like an extended and well produced television show instead of a movie. The pacing and how the plot opens up has an episodic feel to it. But don't let that keep you from seeing Serenity. If it's like a TV show, it's like the best TV show you will ever see on the big screen.While this movie only had a budget about $40 million you wouldn't know by looking at it. They put that money on some fantastic special effects. The scenes in space are beautiful to behold, both the calm ones and the massively large ship battles. I'm talking about ship battles with more intensity than Star Wars Episode III. Even if the movie feel likes a TV show the audio is a major boost up and the added effects do stand out in a very good way. The acting is so solid you will find yourself liking more than one character in the movie. The music is also a nice blend of that space opera soundtrack and old west.This release is essentially a re-release of the Blu-Ray and DVD in one package with one extra never before offered: A digital copy disk. Finally you now can upload a legit copy of Serenity to your portable device, which a lot of people have been looking for. Here is a list of all of the features:Alliance Database - Includes dossiers on all of the Firefly crew, profiles on planets, various historical entries, vehicle references and details on the reavers.U Control - This is broken down into four sections: Mr. Universe Compendium, Digital Tour of Serenity, Picture in Picture and Visual Commentary. It appears these are all interactive features instead of simple menu items.BD Live: My Scenes Sharing - Additional content can be offered if you have an internet enabled BD player (and storage space).Feature Commentery with Writer and Director Joss Whedon - A lot of director-type information like lighting and what camera lenses they used, but mentions nothing in lines of background info on the story. Joss also self-depreciates himself a lot on the commentary. First it's entertaining that he can crack wise on himself, but it eventually gets old.Feature Commentary with Joss Whedon & Cast Members Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau and Ron Glass. They did a lot of cutting up in that one. Fun to listen to for a while.Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Director Joss Whedon - Nine total. Some of these scenes are nice and some are so-so. Would be nice if Joss made a director's cut and put some of these scenes back in.Future History: The Story of Earth That Was - Interview with Joss Whedon on how he got Firefly off the ground and so forth.What's In A Firefly - Essentially a featurette on the special effects of the movie.Re-Lighting The Firefly - Little documentary on the canceling of Firefly and how it came back to life in the form of this movie. Almost a tear-jerker for fans who experienced it firsthand.A Filmmaker's Journey - A more in-depth documentary on the creating the movie. Includes some nice details on the actor's and how well they work together.We'll Have A Fruity Oaty Good Time! - Mini-doc on the creation of the crazy commercial that River went nuts after watching. Comes with the complete commercial.Extended Scenes - Four scenes in the movie in their extended glory. don't expect anything massive. These extended scenes aren't longer by much. I have no idea why Joss doesn't just put these in the disk and call the movie the extended edition. Oh well...Take A Walk On Serenity - A snarky tour of the set with the director and actors.The Green Clan - Documentary on Jeff Green the cinematographer.Session 416 - All five web videos on River's final sessions at the academy they released prior to the movie.On top of all that you get 2.35:1 1080p video and lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. If you are a fan of Firefly and haven't gotten Serenity yet... well shame on you. If you have the DVD and are ready to make the jump to Blu-Ray... well the previous disk is a bit cheaper now. So this is for those fans who want the digital copy. If you don't know anything about Firefly I suggest seeing the show first. Netflix has it and the series is on DVD and Blu-Ray everywhere. It's best to experience the series and move to this movie as everything comes together much better.	5.0	Finally a Digital copy w/ Blu-Ray!!!	2011-06-16	20	20	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3BJUP5ST81AU7	S. Rhea	Ok, let me start off by saying that Firefly, like all of Joss Whedon's shows, is quirky. Think of a marriage of concepts that is one part Star Wars, one part spaghetti western and one part seven samauri and you'd come close. Take that and add Whedon's incredible knack for having characters say and do all those little things you always wished TV/movie characters would say or do. In Firefly the magic worked and it worked well. Unfortunately, the very quirkiness that made the show click also made some people slow to give it a try, which is what (I think) lead to its early demise. Had it been given the same chance its sister show Buffy the Vampire Slayer had for the buzz to get out, I think it would have enjoyed similar success.Alas.Serenity is a true successor to the TV show without FEELING like a TV show transferred to the big screen. It clicks on so many levels. It'll make you laugh out loud, cry, and rage. It's action-packed but also very dramtically compelling, building on character relationships as well as tackling questions we were teased with in the series. However, whether you have seen the series or not, there's something in here for any fan of science fiction.There's a reason this show has such a cult following. Trust me, if you get a chance, see the show, follow it up with the movie. It's a ride you won't forget.	5.0	One of the best shows to ever hit TV	2005-12-21	11	10	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3L3PJ9RB815JB	"S. Smith ""Flokk"""	"A friend recommended the show ""Firefly"" to me a few months back. Per his advice, I picked it up. I skipped through a few episodes, didn't really watch much, and pronounced it ""stupid."" Just before this movie hit theaters (I had no idea it was even in theaters until I saw the review section!), I sat down and seriously watched it - and I was hooked. It's science fiction in some of the best traditions of science fiction: witty, well-written, self-deprecating, individualistic, and with plenty of almost palatable comraderie to flesh out every scene.And this movie? It's even better. It has all thrill and geniune fun (and much more serious elements, ultimately) that each of the new Star Wars movies lacked in some department, and more interestingly, none of the clear good-and-evil themes - and that after the ""Firefly"" rebels already lost badly. Most of all, the universe is utterly believable. This Joss Whedon cat plainly gleaned much from his science fiction forerunners, but he integrated it as a part of something distinctly his own creation. With genuinely good science fiction in such an awful back-burner rut (unless you count billions of dollars in ubiquitous Star Wars merchandise; thank God that's over), I'm simply happy that somebody stepped up to the task, boldly going where...well, where nobody has seriously gone in some time.So yes, buy this movie, rent this movie, stick it in your kids' stockings. Just turn that God-awful cover towards the wall so they don't pitch it, thinking you got them a crappy B movie as a joke. Seriously though, it's probably the one Hollywood movie released this year that's utterly enjoyable and completely rewatchable.On a side note, I'm 95% sure I saw Nathan Fillion (""Cap'n"") in ""Saving Private Ryan"" - he had a bit role as the first, mistakenly identified Private Ryan. On another side note, I've never watched Angel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They looked remarkably stupid."	5.0	Great sci-fi in the classic tradtion.	2005-12-06	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3CYS74ICMQGF7	S. Smith	"I did not watch Firefly when it was on TV.  I was not a fan of anything Joss Whedon did before (e.g. Buffy the Vampire Slayer).  I point this out because gushing fans can muddy the waters when trying to figure out if something new you haven't heard of is really ""good"" or not.Serenity is a fantastic sci-fi movie.  In fact, it is fantastic entertainment, period.  And I don't say that lightly.  I mean, let's be honest with ourselves, most sci-fi movies are either utter garbage, or nerd fodder with a very narrow appeal.This is not the case with Serenity.  It is, quite simply, a great adventure movie, that just happens to be in a futuristic setting.  There is NOT alot of dorky techo-babble being thrown around, you aren't subjected to mock-philosophical babbling, there isn't any magical bullcrap, and there are no goofy aliens geeking things up.  It has good actors portraying fun characters in exciting situations.  There is humor, action, horror, and just a little bit of romance.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AATKF0HDBQL86	"S. Smith ""ltcolkiranerys"""	I've had the privilege of seeing Serenity with my husband not just once, but TWICE -- once at a sneak preview several weeks ago, and again at a special midnight showing for the Browncoats in the Denver area prior to the movie's premiere here.Having said that, I can't begin to tell everyone how highly I recommend this movie.  Set in the future, Serenity picks up about where its predecessor (the short-lived, but much-loved, sci-fi/Western series Firefly) left off, weaving a tale that is rich and complex, bound to snare both fans and non-fans alike.  Written and directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel series creator Joss Whedon, Serenity brings back the entire cast of regulars from Firefly: Nathan Fillion as Capt. Mal Reynolds; Gina Torres as Zoe; Alan Tudyk as Zoe's husband, Wash; Morena Baccarin as Inara; Jewel Staite as ship's mechanic Kaylee; Sean Maher as doctor-turned-fugitive Simon Tam; Summer Glau as Simon's sister, River; Adam Baldwin as Jayne; and Barney Miller's Ron Glass as Shepherd Book.  I am pleased to know that all of the Firefly regulars chose to come back for Serenity; had they declined, the film would have been nowhere as good as the series, and I would have been even less inclined to watch it.All in all, I have to say that Joss did a wonderful job with Serenity.  It's one of the best genre films I've seen since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it's going to be one of those that anyone will want to see again and again.	5.0	Breakin' Atmo With A BANG!	2005-09-30	18	17	1

It's all about personal taste, and this one suited mine (and many others as well).  It became the movie that I would fall asleep to on several nights. Soothing, I guess you could say.Once I realized that there was a whole season of Serentity out there in a boxed set called Firefly, I bought it right away.  Loved that too.  Probably even more than the movie.Anyways. Buy the movie. Buy the Series. Buy everything, and then buy it again for your best friend.

Granted I'm totally biased since I am an absolute fan of the ""Firefly"" tv series. All in all though, this movie puts the ""Star Wars"" prequels to shame. Lots of action, snarky dialogue, suspense and heart. One of my cousins liked this movie without knowing any of the backstory, i.e. without having to watch the series.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AGMW3I34INNYG	Stephen Cannon	"Serenity, based on the short lived TV series ""Firefly,"" is essentially a space western, or a cowboy sci-fi story, depending on your vantage point.  Although ""Firefly"" lived a shourt television life, it was released on DVD and found a new audience there.  Now, armed with the original cast, a bigger budget, and a good script, Joss Whedon, the mind behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" brings his trademark imagination and wit to his feature directing debut.In a future where space is still being discovered and colonized by humanity, Malcolm Reynolds and his ragtag crew aboard the Serenity are getting by as a crew of smugglers and thieves, doing odd jobs wherever they can.  When an assassin tracks them down, looking for the young girl River, questions arise as to River's shady past.  Is she a killing machine?  What does she know?  Colflicts arise among the crew; some of them want her to be gone, sparing them extra trouble, while her brother, the ship's doctor, insists that she can be saved and will not kill the ship's crew.The story takes many turns but stays interesting throughout.  The cast, all pretty much unknown, perform as a solid ensemble.  The effects are beautiful and virtually seamless.  This is a breath of fresh air.  Final grade: A"	5.0	Solid fun, original premise make for great viewing	2006-01-30	6	5	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1QB0OWE8IW54E	Stephen C. Wylder	"I had seen Joss Whedon's TV show Firefly on TV, and liked it enough to by it on DVD. When I heard they were making a movie of it, I was ecstatic.Usually a movie to which one has built up such excitement for disapoints, you exit the theatere becouse the movie did not meet your expectation.Serenity took my expectations, and did things I could ahve never wished for. Instead of merely answering questions raised by the show, the movie twisted and turned any ""facts"" it told the audiance until no one in the theatere could say with a straight face they werent shocked. I was bowled over.I shant give away anything, that would ruin the film, but JOss whedon came up with an incredibly creepy, myterious, and downright facinating place for the heros to go to that weve never seen before.Also, dont worry about if you havent seen the show this is based on, my mother hadnt and she enjoyed the film just as much as me. Make sure to look for David Krumholtz (from ""Numb3rs"" and ""Ray"") as Mr.Universe... A very funny man... and on that note, I will finish off by saying, its really incredible that this movie is both Scary, Funny, Noir, and action packed, with out ever getting silly, stupid, loosing its characters, or having a boring scene.Make sure you use the bathroom before this one, you wont want to get up."	5.0	Like nothing other	2005-12-10	14	13	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A35H2EI8SFHKBM	Stephen Jacob	"Joss Whedon's masterpiece television series, Firefly, came to the big screen in 2005 with Serenity. This movie really does live up to the series. It is of course different in that the sort of things you can do in a movie are different from the sort of things that you can do in a series, however Joss Whedon was allowed to make the movie he wanted to make, and the result is stunning. I have seen ""Serenity"" roughly 20 times, and, to quote from a line from one of the characters, ""that's never getting old."""	5.0	Amazing TV show brought successfully to the silver screen.	2008-02-05	2	1	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	"Not having seen the television show it's based on -- but well aware of its grand reputation among many sci-fi fans -- I watched ""Serenity"" with great expectations.  Perhaps too great.  The film is reasonably crafted but nothing groundbreaking, as pretty much all of the contemporary cliches are there: wisecracking crew, ramshackle spaceship, snarky interpersonal relationships, an oppressive galactic empire, rather slow and clumsy martial arts, and so on.  The film offers a few surprises, but even they seem borrowed from other projects.  Shades of the famous scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" the put-upon, Han Solo-esque captain, for instance, shoots his apparently unarmed adversary rather than get into a prolonged fight . . . the difference here is that it leads to a prolonged fight anyway.  The production is an ADHD combination of elements, something of a pastiche of ""Star Wars"" tossed with ""Blade Runner"" and an odd American western sensibility mixed with some troublng eastern subtexts.  (I asked someone about this and, apparently, Asians are the primary architects of this dypstopian future, which at least partially explains yet another nearly all Anglo spaceship crew.)Now, the more important issue:  Does it all work?  For the most part and taken for what it is, which is to say shoot-'em-up sci-fi, yes.  Though ""Serenity"" feels like a TV show, except for some requisite scenes of exposition in the middle, it moves at a fast enough pace for viewers to overlook its shortcomings.  The cast is competent if relatively unknown (I did recognize Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass), even if they look a bit like second-tier soap opera types or porn stars.  A standout is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who makes for a particularly icy villain.  The plot moves toward an intense climax that is satisfying if open-ended, again not surprising for a production based on a television show . . . perhaps one in hopes of being resurrected, a la ""Star Trek.""  In many ways, I wouldn't mind that happening."	4.0	Old TV Shows Don't Die . . . They Don't Even Fade Away Anymore	2007-04-05	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A171FU7AC9YYMS	"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe"""	"By now you've no doubt read the full range of reviews from those who think Joss Whedon is God, to those who think this movie is the scum of existence.  (I'm puzzled how a simple movie can create such emotional responses, but I digress.I'll tell you this, I went into this movie having never seen any of the original FireFly TV series.  I went in expecting big Sci-Fi action - I came out thinking, ""That was not a Sci-Fi movie"" - and it's not.  It's a western - in space!  Yes, these people are in spaceships - and yes, they are on different planets - and yes, it is in the future.  But at this point, the Sci-Fi aspect has reached its zenith.  Every planet they land on could be earth, there are no ""strange alien worlds"" - in fact, there are no aliens at all!  And their guns do not fire lasers, they fire regular bullets.  And they don't beam down to the service, they fly down.  Basically, aside from the spaceships moving them from planet to planet, there is little Sci-Fi to this at all - well, the whole ""government turned my sister into a psychic super-weapon"" thing is Sci-Fi, but that's about it.  As for action - again, not a big budget blow-'em-up action type of movie.  There is a ""hovercraft to ship"" chase near the beginning, and a brief but major space battle near the end - but in between, it's mostly fisticuffs for the action.  So, in short, if you are looking for a STAR WARS style big-action movie, or a STAR TREK themed science fiction alien-fest, you will likely hate this movie!BUT - if you like your movies deep and intelligent, then buy this movie.  If you like your cast to have such a strong repore that you'd swear they've known each other from the cradle, buy this movie.  If you like witty dialogue that isn't purile and obscene, nor written on a 6th grade level, BUY THIS MOVIE!  If you like a movie that leaves you begging for just another half-hour to spend with the characters, BUY THIS MOVIE!!Yes, it wasn't what I expected - but it was so much more!  It was a movie with a purpose, a movie with a background, and a movie with a purpose beyond the titilation of violence, sex, explosions, and eye candy.  Joss Whedon, like George Lucas or J.R.R. Tolkein, has not only created a great cast and storyline, but has set them in a world that is so backed-up with sub-story, so possible as our future, and so realistically conveyed, that you end the movie just wanting to explore every aspect of this future world, yet only having just scratched the surface!  Like the best of stories, you leave with the sense that, though what you saw was good, what you didn't see was so much more interesting - and you hope to get a sequel just to delve deeper into that world!  That's why this film drew such comparisons to STAR WARS - not for it's budget, nor for it's mystical force-centric storyline - but for its ability to sell you on the Universe it has created.And let's not forget the actors - this was probably one of the best casts ever assembled (for both the TV series, and the movie).  Through great writing and skilled acting, you get a real sense that these are not actors spouting lines, but real characters who have been working on this ship for over a year now, and have developed a true bond.  Each actor convincingly fills their space with talent and believability.  None of the lines ever feel inserted for the sake of becoming a new catch-phrase - every line is believable and serves a purpose!  This is what TRULY makes this film (and the TV series it came from) so unique and worthy of another fully-budgeted shot at the big time!Unfortunately, everything this film has going for it is exactly what curses it to failure.  The mass audiences of today do not want a deep and well thought out storyline.  They want explosions, boobies, and potty-humor, or else they call it stupid.  Or, if it's set in space, it HAS TO follow the STAR TREK mold, or else it cannot possibly be any good.But, if nothing else, Joss Wheson did his fan base a HUGE favor by bringing the Firefly story arch to a satisfying closure, while still leaving an open door for future stories.  With this movie, one can enjoy the original 13 episodes, and then cap it off with this movie, and feel like they have a complete piece of work, should a sequel or revised TV series never take place.So, if you are tired of the insulting fare Hollywood has spewed onto us over the last few years, SERENITY may be for you.  If the new STAR WARS trilogy left you cold, this might be the movie for you.  If you can appreciate the poetic beauty of a true western set in space, this movie will appeal to you.But if you are simply going in for the misleading DVD cover and the promise of a big action spectacle, you may want to think again!  Even so, give this movie a chance to work it's magic!FINAL NOTE - to all you ""ONE STAR"" reviewers out there, I challenge you to provide an actual REASON why this movie sucks - merely saying, ""IT SUCKS - I'M GIVING IT ONE STAR.  EVERYONE WHO LIKE IT IS STOOPID."" does not convince anyone."	5.0	THIS IS NOT A SCI-FI MOVIE!! But it is one of the best adventures I've ever seen!	2005-11-14	36	34	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1Z4HI0OUWRIS4	Steve Kanayama	There are so many TV shows getting canceled regardless how good those shows are.....Firefly on FOX network was one of them.  Instead of just terminate the production, they made a future film called Serenity......This movie futures none A-list movie actors what so ever.  I recognized Adam Baldwin, Nathan Fillion from 90's sitcom Two guys, a girl and Pizza Place!? but it didn't stop to make a great film here.  All characters were well developed and all actors contributed their A games to this film.  The film has little bit of everything such as Western, kung Fu, Japanese Anime, we recognized from 70's and 80's throw back space battle scenes from Star wars.  The script is very serious and intense, and yet Fillion and Baldwin delivered some what goofiness and humors.  Yes, this movie barrowed so many aspects from other type of films and yet turned into something very original.	5.0	Guilty Pleasure???	2006-02-04	8	7	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AE03XDXCJCG53	"Steven Gibson ""Action and SF critic"""	The movie Serenity is one of the best movies in the last 10-20 years. It is a movie that spans action and human relations. From the opening dialogue to the titles to space action scenes to fight scenes to character revealing conversations this is a movie that stands out above the crowd. I have seen the movie 8 times in theatres and keep finding new gems to admire and appreciate.It is a story about 9 individuals that find themselves in a dangerous time with dangerous people after them. How they survive and make the hard decisions is a edge of the seat story. I am a movie watching fan. I enjoy Sci-fi, action and especially if they are funny. This was the perfect movie for me. It has well portrayed suspense, action and humor.Even the villain was outstanding. Every action movie fan has sat through totally unreal villains that are laughable. The Operative is not laughable. He is a villain we call can be afraid of, without despising or hating.The special effects where incredible, especially considering the budget they had to work with. Some extensive fight scenes included unarmed combat, guns, cannons, swords and long bows. The stand out special effect was the space battle scene. I love a pod race as much as the next person, but here we are talking about a space battle involving 80 craft from the perspective of one ship traveling through the battle.In spite of all the action, the human relations are the reason to see this movie. The movie is about love, loss, fear and impossible decisions. In this movie you again learn that some decisions are so difficult that no choice is the right choice. You learn that loss can hurt no matter how good the cause. And you learn to love 9 characters and their lives. I want to visit this world again and spend more time with these characters.	5.0	One of the best movies of any genre	2005-11-03	27	26	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AM71STVDHO48S	Stoddard76	"If you liked the TV series ""Firefly"" that this movie was based upon, you are in for a real surprise with ""Serenity"". This film is not just as good as the wrongly cancelled TV show, but even better. I loved ""Firefly"" and have no doubt it would have been an excellent show given the time to mature. But I'm obsessed with ""Serenity"". This movie is excellent from beginning to end. Even if you haven't seen the series, you will be able to follow ""Serenity"" (although I do recommend that you do watch the show before the movie to get the full effect). Joss Whedon makes you love his characters. And the situations he places them into in this movie makes them shine in ways they didn't in the show. The story is marvelous and the various themes Whedon explores are brilliant (themes also seen in Buffy and Angel). This is not just some cheap space sci-fi flick, this movie is EPIC! My wife, who ordinarily does not like these types of films, also loved the show-and was astounded by the movie.I just can't stop saying how good this movie really is; you must see it for yourself. There are not enough stars to give it-no exaggeration. You will love this movie! Buy it, rent it or borrow it-do anything to see it. Kudos to Joss Whedon on this monumental and unprecedented achievement!

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2HMZNZFOZ4EL1	Stresspuppy	I disagree with some of the viewers who claim this is better than the series; I think it does an extremely good job tying the series together in a way that the network did not allow. I think the impact of Serenity, while it can be watched on its own, is diminished without the backstories from the Firefly series.It seems clear that Mr. Wheddon and his cast are all comfortable with the roles of the characters which makes the story so credible. At heart it is a western with frontier justice and 'regular' people forming a small community/family in order to survive adversity.I haven't gone much in the story because it is already well reviewed previously; it deals basically with a small band of space frontiersmen trying to elude pursuit by the military because they are harboring/protecting a young fugitive, who was the subject of military experiments. The greater arc soon unfolds, encompassesing the origins of the cannibalistic reavers... a more dangerous form of a highwayman.To get the most out of this movie -- which is still recommended regardless given the good writing, great casting, and strong acting -- I would strongly urge you to see the series first because the motives driving the various characters are clearer and the story because so much more compelling when you are already invested in the characters.Stay Shiny.	4.0	Shiny!	2006-05-12	7	6	1

All the characters worked well and it wasn't dumbed down or slowed down for a mass-audience. It was pretty amazing that he was able to jam so much plot and quirky personality into just two hours.Whedon wrote this as fun, light sci-fi entertainment and it was a great success, far better than the dreck usually found on the sci-fi network.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1QVARU29455D0	Stuart W. Liming	Serenity is the film sequel to the single season of the television series Firefly.  While knowledge of Firefly is not required, it's not a bad idea, as you gain a deeper appreciation for the characters.  It is a unique vision of the future, and just enough grounded dialogue to keep the audience watching.This is, however, the final part of the saga.  The story hints that there is a little hope for future tales, but (SPOILERS) several crew members are dead. (END SPOILERS)  That shouldn't get your hopes up, though.  On the business end, it was amazing that Serenity was even made, much less a sequel after its lackluster theatrical showing.  Do not despair too much, though.  It's a good ending, and a lot of closure is there.Overall, I think you'll like the film, and you'll probably enjoy the TV show.  But let's not go nuts.  The signal has stopped after this.	4.0	A fitting end...if only the fans would accept it.	2006-02-10	3	1	2
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A42OSZCYJ8IKM	sunderi	What can I say?  Cancelled TV shows aren't supposed to become major motion pictures.  But this one did, and it's fantastic.You don't have to have seenFirefly - The Complete Seriesto appreciate this movie, but if you like Serenity (and you will) you'll want to see Firefly, and then you'll have seen it all out of order, so just go ahead and see Firefly first.That being said, the movie is fantastic.  Aside from a couple of plot points that I could have done without (*ahem*) it's masterful.  It's wonderful storytelling about captivating characters on a marvelous adventure.

The DVD iteself is full of everything I want as a film / TV fan, and I've used it to turn people onto this amazing world.  Not to push sales onto folks, but it's totally worth it to get both the film and TV show, you'll be looking for the other if you get one anyway.It's simply that good.	5.0	How do folks not know about Firefly / Serenity ?	2006-02-16	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2DJ0H86YM7G0K	SuperScuba	Whether you have seen Firefly or not, I think there is something anyone can enjoy about Serenity.  I actually saw this movie before watching the Firefly series.  I was so intrigued by the story I wanted to see more and believe me, I was not disappointed.  Firefly is now one of my favorite TV shows of all time with Serenity being on of my favorite movies.If you have seen Firefly, there probably won't be any need to tell you how good this movie is.  I'm sure you will buy it anyway.  But if you are a hardcore fan, there are more extras in this collector's edition that I'm sure you won't want to miss.For those of you who are just looking for a decent science-fiction film, look no further.

Within 24 hours of seeing this film, however, I bought the Firefly series on DVD.Anyone will tell you that Nathan Fillion as Captain Reynolds is the heart and soul of this film.  Reynolds is built in the Han Solo archetype, only grittier, funnier, more violent and just as charismatic.  Fillion and Ejiofor (as the cooly evil Operative) steal every scene in this film.  In fact, the film peaks whenever these two are sharing screentime.The other actors are not in the same class, but the script and direction are so good that it is difficult to fault any aspect of the film.This is one of those rare films that makes you want to buy another ticket right after seeing it.NOTE: Some reviewers have said that it is easy to get lost if you haven't seen ""Firefly.""

This story was even richer and funnier than Firefly, which I didn't think possible.  By the end of Firefly, the actors had formed a chemistry, which I'm happy to say was still there for Serenity.  The characters played off each other in wonderous ways, and I was so so sad when the story ended.  I wanted more.We got some answers to the questions proposed in Firefly, but not all.  Joss Whedon did a marvelous job telling his story in this medium, and hats off to him for working so hard to bring us, the fans, at least this much.  He's become one of my favorite writers for TV or big screen.	5.0	great sequel to Firefly	2007-07-16	3	3	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1BNDT8YYAOK4H	Take a Louie at Texas	Ok, so I remember watching one episode on TV of Firefly.  I remember liking it, but as things go, I lost track of it.Well, I tacked on a used Serenity DVD to one of my orders, just as a 'take a chance' type choice.  And I finally got around to watching it recently.Why did I wait so long!!  This is a 2 hour thrill ride that you will not notice is 2 hours in the least!!!  The chemistry between the actors is always noticable, and the humor shared is subtle, but still hits you, and does not lay flat at all!  The contrast between the villian and the anti-hero was also welcome, even if it was a bit western in feel.The story is a little conventional 'chase the truth' type movie.  Where the clues lead to somewhere they know is suicide to venture, but they do it anyway (don't want to give anything else away).  Most of it ties in well though, and only feels contrived at a couple points in the movie.  The dialogue is written oddly, again playing the to the western themes, but you get used to it within the first 30 minutes.The one complaint I have are the very darkly lit shots on the Firefly itself.  I figure this was intentional as there are starkly contrasting shots in other scenes for different 'feels' in the movie.  And a couple of shots were dark to leave you with that 'what just happened!?' feel... to good effect.  However, there were some shots on the Firefly that were just dialogue, and were dark for no good reason.  This group of actors seemed to work well together, so it was a shame to not clearly see all their nuances when interacting.Once you get past that, Serenity is a great movie, well worthy of multiple viewings.  I hope to put it back in the player and watch it with the commentary on... something I rarely do with a DVD.	4.0	Review from someone not infatuated with the TV series	2008-05-02	1	0	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AZS4F219O9KLA	"Tammy ""Tammy"""	I saw 'Serenity' first. I'd never seen the series 'Firefly' and neither had the friend who had gotten a bootleg copy of the Serenity dvd. We sat down and watched it and were immediately sucked in. We didn't know the characters, we didn't identify with them as deeply as those who had seen the series first. But it didn't matter. The action, the well-written quips, the fear that after that first death no one was safe, kept our attention for a solid 2 hours.As soon as it ended, we both immediately went out and bought a copy. Then we looked everywhere for the box set - it was sold out. Everywhere. It was maddening to try and get a copy of it. In Los Angeles of all places. That shows just how popular this series was/has become.The series is FAR better than the movie in that it had a 14 hour span to tell a story. Each character has their time in the spotlight and in each episode we learn more about them. They're flawed, they're not perfect, but that's what makes them 'real'.The movie was an excellent continuation of a story that was prematurely cut by executives that just didn't undestand Joss Whedon's vision - or didn't feel it was profitable enough.Of course, in a film, there isn't as much time for character moments, but they're there. And if enough people purhase this special edition, Joss said at a recent interview at Comic Con 2007, that the possibility for a sequel rests on sales of this dvd.If you liked it the first time, you'll like it again with all the nifty new additions.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2KNR5UD60YKNJ	"Tamra Sibsted ""1centwiz"""	Interesting way to merge a western with Sci-fi! This movie really pulls all of the Firefly episodes into focus and allows the audience to experience closure of a TV episode that was canceled way to early. I suppose if the Fox network would have shown the original series in order, it might have helped the audience go with the flow instead of trying to guess how or what or why things happened in a more chronological order. I suggest those that love this movie to get the series set and watch them in order. I know there are a lot of people out there that are not just fans, but are part of the Firefly Cult Group. It's also nice to see the actors that were in the movie and the series getting some action in Hollywood. The Captain is one of the newest additions to Desperate Housewifes and more of the original crew have been seen in other popular shows.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AFCVIC17HNV0G	Tara	"I'll start off by saying that, as a general rule, I really, REALLY hate science fiction. I enjoy fantasy, but the big, overblown, impersonal government-based plot lines that tend to bog down science fiction bores the crap out of me.The great thing about rules is that they were made to be broken, and the Firefly franchise is one of the few exceptions I make in my ""Sci-Fi is Booooring"" rule, mostly because of the absurdly well-developed characterizations. Rarely are relationships so defined and multi-layered in BOOKS, let alone in TV and movies.The movie doesn't disappoint with the characterizations, either. Although we get a very condensed version of what makes these people tick, Joss Whedon does a superb job of making both the fan and the casual viewer care about what happens to the crew of Serenity, and the actors are excellent at making those characters believable.Just to focus on the antagonist for a moment, I can't remember the last time I've seen a bad guy so wonderfully written (or acted) in an action movie. Instead of creating a character who is flat-out evil, Whedon gives us a very human character who is eerily similar to the hero, Mal Reynolds in how he chooses to let his convictions and needs drive him, even when they make him do things that are evil. He's a monster, and he knows it, but he continues to be one because he truly believes the things he does will benefit mankind in the longrun. As a matter of fact, the BIGGEST difference between Mal and The Operative is that The Operative fits the profile of the stereotypical hero far better than Mal does. As far as I'm concerned, it's the best twist in the whole movie, but I'm weird about stuff like that.Enough with the over-analysis! Summing up: The writing is fun, the characters are fabulous, the plot brings the action and also makes you think without shoving political statements down your throat, and the movie boasts some of the best underrated actors in the business (Adam Baldwin, Alan Tudyk, Gina Torres, etc.). Watch this movie."	5.0	Amazing Movie	2005-10-26	5	4	1

I picked up Serenity on HD-DVD after Blu-ray won the war, along with a number of other movies I had never heard of, but all going real cheap on HD-DVD. I was immediately hooked! I found out about Firefly, and had to pick up the series as well. I watched the whole series, one after another. I can't believe Fox cut it, but I'm guessing it's like Amiga computers. Great for their time, but never promoted enough to take off here (unlike in Europe).I ran into audio / video sync issues on Windows, but my HTPC's LG BR / HD-DVD player has no sync issues using Ubuntu.If you haven't seen the series, or the movie, definately worth the time!

(Theory has it that they'll get a sequel that way.)Anyways, I love Firefly and Serenity myself -- but I'm (gasp!) a *regular* person who simply likes good sci-fi when he sees it.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1E7QUM8DG0D16	Teresa Medeiros	"As some of you probably already know, Joss Whedon, the genius behind BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, did a short-lived TV ""space western"" called FIREFLY on Fox in 2002. The network pulled the show after only 11 episodes (obviously taking a cue from the Mensa candidates over at the SciFi network who cancelled FARSCAPE). But the show had already spawned a loyal fan base who called themselves ""Browncoats."" They recruited more devotees when the entire series was recently released on DVD and it was their passionate campaigning that helped get Joss Whedon a greenlight to bring his ragtag crew of space explorers to the big screen in SERENITY.I havn't yet seen a single episode of FIREFLY (although I have the DVD's sitting on my bookshelf) but I have to confess that I liked SERENITY better than all 3 of the most recent STAR WARS movies combined. Captain Mal Reynolds seems to be a combination of Captain Kirk, Han Solo, and that wisecracking pilot from your last Southwest flight. (Ya gotta love a captain who picks up the mic and announces, ""We may experience some slight turbulence...and explode"" and a crew member that whines back at him, ""But I don't WANT to explode!"")His crew members all had distinct personalities and you truly believed that they were as devoted to each other as they were to their battle-scarred ship. The movie had the best futuristic dialogue I've heard since MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME. The music worked for me, the visuals worked, and all of those thrilling episodes of derring do were deftly mixed with the wonderful touches of humor and humanity that are Joss Whedon's trademark as a writer.If you enjoy space opera, if you enjoy a good western, if you simply enjoy interesting characters doing interesting things while tossing off genuinely amusing wisecracks, then you should probably find some SERENITY now!(Orginally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at [...]"	5.0	SERENITY Now!	2008-07-15	6	6	0

It had never really been on my radar.It wasn't until I discovered it on Amazon Prime that I understood what so many passionate followers were talking about.  It was an excellent series, blending my favorite subject: science fiction with something I had never thought much of, the classic Western.  The blend is pure genius and I savored every episode of the series, just so that I could make it last.The culmination of all of this, ""Serenity"", took the original premise and brought layers of complexity to the story and to the whole ambience of the film, which benefitted greatly from the heightened level of special effects.It was hard to say goodbye to the crew of Serenity, but if I miss them, all I have to do is watch the series all over again.

River's dialogue consisting of double meanings and answers that portent the future revelation of Miranda, is ever intriguing.The commentary by Joss Whedon makes the Collector's Edition worth purchasing.  His insights into the relation between Mal and River put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.  Particularly, it wasn't clear to me why the Captain saved River by bringing her back aboad the ship after the fight in the bar.  It didn't register with me, until Whedon pointed it out, that River and the Captain were the most alike of all the characters.I, like many others, hope this is not the last flight of Serenity.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A19SLGYKHLTEV9	"texastoone ""author, Mama's Country Cooking"""	I have a new hero.  Captain Mal of star clunker Serenity.  This movie caught me by surprise.  My ex told me he'd heard of a great sci-fi movie and took me too it. We were still married at the time.  But since I only dream of Mal contently, he's left me to my dreams.  Just kiddin'  I dream of the whole cast of Serenity.  In my mind they are still out there getting into more mischeif with River discovering she has a love of flying and takes the wheel on more of Mal & Zooey's steal from the rich give to the poor adventures with Jayne bringing all his grenades.  Doc & kayleey staying behind to do anything but talk.  Inara staying close waiting to tell Mal how she really feels, maybe even having dinner done by the time they get back from a successful heist.  Really.  I can dream... After I saw the movie I had to rush out and buy the Firefly series.  I fell in love with this show and would even call myself a browncoat and follow these guys right back to space.  I did hate to see two of the shows supporting characters killed off in the movie.  Wash & Book were great and did the series credit!If you haven't seen the show.  YOU ARE MISSING OUT.  This is old west adventure set in the future.  Love the fact that ther is no swearing.  If you saw it and didn't like it, then you must be an extremely BORING person (yawn).  Joss I want to be there when you write the new series, hell I'll even help.  Please TV gods somewhere pick up the show and get it going again.  You did it for Star Trek.  (Speaking of the only other sci-fi you'll see real fist fighting was Captian Kirk)I hope we don't have to wait long.  Don't hesitate to buy the movie and the series.  You want be disappointed.  The writing, character buildup, creativeness, everything is great!  If I had 4 thumbs, they'd all be UP!

I had not seen the Firefly TV series, but am a fan of Buffy and Angel.  Serenity offers Joss Whedon's wit in a ""realistic"" sci-fi world.  The repartee among the ensemble cast is so enjoyable, I've watched it multiple times just for the dialogue and the laughs it brings.  Then I bought the Firefly series.  More wit; more laughs.

But if a movie ever deserved it, it would be this one.The Phantom Menance WISHES it was as cool as this movie, but then again it wishes it was as cool as the Sahara. Poor Phantom Menance, and yet it makes a great comparison to Serenity, an underrated movie with one tenth the budget that delivers 5,000% square rooted by a prime string theory.I might not know my maths, or what the capital of Uruguay is, but I do know my movies and my street address, and this is a movie not to be missed unless you've got some terminal 24 hour disease and then you should probably spend it saying goodbye to friends and family instead.Great cast, great writing, things that go boom AND boo, what more could you ask for unless you were incredibly high maintenance?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2WIZO4KS4W139	thecynicalone	"There are three things wrong with this movie:1. It was made for the fans of the Firefly show which means the rest of us are very confused2. It felt as if I was watching a very long television episode3. The endingThe rest was unbelievable.  As in good, very good.  In my entire life there has only been two movies that I really like despite not knowing why.  This is one of them.  I am not a ""Browncoat"" nor a big sci-fi fan.  However I do enjoy the genre, despite being very cliche.  Serenity manages to avoid this by eliminating a fair number of them, and attempting to use science (still riddled with techno mumbo jumbo unfortunately) to explain the rest.  The only problems left is how the ship flies (it should blow up), something no series that I've seen has managed to explain, and having it be only 500 years in the future.  I do believe the technology could exist, but a multi-generational ship whould take time, plus the terra-forming decades, plus time for settlements, plus waiting until the US and China get along, plus figuring a way to make people psycic, plus the elevation of a prostitute like class, plus a population high enough to make colonizing another solar system worthwile.  I need about 800-1000 years minimum(of course I have yet to see the series) to fit it all in.The movie manage to be realistic enough to make the viewer think it possible, but fictional enough so they realizes it wouldn't.  Also, unlike other sci-fi I've seen there is refreshing simplicity to it.  The crew isn't fighting to save the 'verse.  Rather they merely want to get on with what they do. (that sounds kinda tacky.  It isn't.)  In the three days I had it (rental) I watched the entire thing three times, and every feature including the commentary, the surprisingly entertaining commentary.  I will buy it, making it as the first movie that I buy not as a gift.And above all This movie does not live up to the hype, but to those with an inklink in sci-fi Serenity offers a change from the typical fare.  To those who think sci-fi is a waste, try to borrow it, but don't get your hopes up.  Anime fans please be quiet and whatever you're currently mad about.*A note to this whose friends recommended Serenity: There is a section where Joss literally tells the fans to recommend it like crazy.  That was the add campaign.  Go figure."	4.0	To big for T.V.  To small for the theaters.  Yet still so good	2006-01-17	8	5	3
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A4TNI303MSD2C	The Ersatz Economist	My wife hates sci-fi.  It is hard to get her to watch anything with me that involves sci-fi.  But after seeing Serenity, she wants to buy the DVD.  It is a wonderful movie that is about characters which drive the plot and not fancy computer created graphics.  The antagonist in this movie is, by far, more menacing than any dark jedi.  I recommend that everyone see the movie in the theater and not wait for the DVD since it plays so well on the big screen.	5.0	Great, even for non-sci-fi viewers.	2005-10-15	8	7	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A91RA1UN67ZC	the game horder	Being a browncoat for a long while after seeing the TV series definitely got me hyped up about this movie! I wasn't able to see it in theaters so I immediately took a chance and pre-ordered this Dvd just the same as I did with the series (see my review for Firefly)! Finally seeing this movie, I was overly impressed with Joss Whedon's storytelling ability and the homely feel I felt when I saw my firefly.First of all, for those who expected this movie to be another episode of the Tv series, it's not. What Whedon did with this movie is bring in old concepts he had for the series that FOX axed. For example, some who had seen the series complained about the darkness of Mal Reynold's attitude, as opposed to the lighter side of him on the series. Whedon always said that his initial take on him was to be a dark character, but because he was under FOX's wing, he had to lighten him up per their orders. I totally get that, and actually seeing the darker side of him in this movie made me like him even MORE than in the series. So basically, I'm saying expect the much of the oldness of the series, but don't be turned off to the newness. If you see the movie in a sort of symbiosis, you'll find the movie way more enjoyable...To the newbies reading this, if you haven't seen the series, it won't hamper you from understanding the movie. Actually, I've heard of many first seeing the movie and liking it so much that they went and bought the series afterwards. Don't be afraid to take a chance with Serenity - you'll be glad you did!All in all, a beautiful space western that deserved to have its story told. Trust me, in a sea of constant horror movies and chick flicks - not to mention all those action flicks that were all flashy lights with no substance - this one was truly a breath of fresh air.

I'm a huge FireFly fan, and I attend ""Can't Stop the Serenity"" events every time I can. This gives me a chance, at least once a year, to see this movie again in a nice theater with great sound.The DVD really did the picture quality pretty decent justice, but the SOUND in this film is a big part of the experience. The DVD just doesn't compare to the BluRay version in the sound department. I finally really hear and feel those initial explosions in the film (during the ""Earth-that-was could no longer sustain us .."" part), all that great music, the battle with the Reavers just beyond the Ion Cloud ... WOW.This movie really forced me to finally get a BluRay player. I can't watch the DVD after watching this on BluRay.

Ideally, a second season (where Wheadon will be able to flesh-out the stories as he does so well) but I will happily take a second movie.  At this point, I have no expectations from entertainment executives.ps - Nathan Fillion's portrayal of Mal ranks up there with the greatest male actors in history.  I'm not overblowing this, I promise.  He has the ""man's man"" vibe with humorist sensibilities, able to care about his crew like no other, and threaten to shoot them all for an ideal.

Joss Whedon is a genius, and the ideas were great as were the effects, the costumes, the music, the videography. But for me the most important part of drama of any sort is how the players work together, 'ensemble'. The Firefly/Serenity cast are magical, the chemistry of the troupe is just remarkable. My favorite scene is the one where River dances with the Reivers.

After all, not many TV shows can successfully make the transition to the big screen.  But my fears were all for naught as I sat in a darkened theatre and watched this group of unlikely heroes fulfill my highest hopes and expectations.  The story line is smart, sharp and doesn't pull any punches.  There were moments when I had to actually remind myself to sit back in my seat, so intense was the action.  There were moments I found tears running down my cheeks, followed immediately by laughter.  If you are not a fan of Firefly the series, you can still fully appreciate ""Serenity"".

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AVG02PKZ958SB	"Thomas A. Taylor ""Binxs"""	This movie is a follow up to the Firefly series that was canceled before its time. I would rate this movie as one of my top 10 favorites of all time. The characters are engaging and believable. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It has moments where you want to stand up and cheer, moments of laughter, and moments of sadness all mixed in a very good way.  The effects, set design, costumes, locations, and props were all extremely well done.In full disclosure though, I did see the series before the movie so the characters were known to me.  In my humble opinion, if they had continued this to more movies, it would have been better than Star Wars and Star Trek and just about anything else.  This is, I believe, is Joss Whedons greatest work.	5.0	Must see	2012-08-15	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2MXODHPV58SB1	Thomas Deishley	I can not add to what the reviews in this space have said. What I can speak to is from the point of view of an actor in this business for a long time . This is what film used to be, A great story, a director writer who knows his craft, A cast of actors who play it real and with heart. None of which are superstars ( even if they deserve it) I got turned on by the series and it transfers to the big screen perfectly. I hope to see more of this type of work in the future because unfortunatly Hollywood needs all the help it can get I gave up going to the movies because I have been disapointed so often I do not wish to spend good money on garbage.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A187O4M7CZMTDB	T. Hunter-Selbrede	"Honestly, I liked Buffy and Angel and was disappointed with Firefly when it aired, giving up after two episodes.  It wasn't until much later, when a co-worker was on a high about this movie, that I was told about the stupidity of Fox waiting to air the pilot for the series 'til the last few episodes.  Ah... now I understand why I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a war with all these people who made no sense.  So, having been given the DVD Series by my Browncoat friend for Xmas, I watched it in the order that it was meant to be seen and became a believer.The reason why I don't give this a 5 star rating is purely visceral.  Perhaps it's because I got to know the characters and story in less than a week, then ordered this DVD to find out about all the hanging issues and questions.  Not to give spoilers, let's just say that I hate it when Whedon does what he does - makes you love believable characters, then has believable things happen to them that you don't like.  I'm in mourning for a group of characters I fell in love with, then had the proverbial air kicked out of me in regards to one of my favorite married couple dynamics ever, and the great mystery behind a man that will never be known now.  I was not prepared to have these things happen to people who I'd only met in a marathon session a week earlier.I can't say how this movie will play to those who haven't watched the TV series.  The action, choreography, acting, writing, humor, horror, and so on were all there.  Whedon's slick translation of the idea of who each character is and the universe in general without making those who saw the series feel like, ""Yeah, yeah, already know that, get to the good part,"" was handled well.  Still, somebody not having seen the series probably won't feel the true depths of the pain and turmoil of the characters.  Had I not seen the series, I doubt I would have ended up as upset as I was.  What's more, those who are inspired to buy or rent the DVD series after having seen Serenity will likely have the ultimate fate of some characters hanging heavy over their heads, which would likely take away from enjoying the myriad character dynamics.  Catch-22, what can you do?"	4.0	Killin' me, Joss...	2006-01-10	11	8	3

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AQS0FWGVAQ51C	TigerNightmare	"Over the years, I've become a huge Joss Whedon fan, for his thoughtfully and intelligently written shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, each filled with gut-busting humor, smart and clever dialogue, involving character development and careful, calculated plotting.  Simply put: the man is a master storyteller.To maximize your enjoyment of Serenity, it is best that you watchFireflyfirst.  Thanks to a brilliantly written introduction, this film is accessible to everyone, but everything is enhanced if you know more about the characters' background and motivation.  Take my advice: if you're thinking about dabbling in this universe, watch the pilot episode of Firefly first.  If you watch it all in order, you will be rewarded handsomely.  With that said, if this advice applies to you and you wish to follow it, please read no further.  The less you know, the better.Serenity takes place about three months after the final episode of Firefly.  Mal is still taking odd jobs, honest or not, in order to keep his crew fed and flying.  The Alliance Parliament desperately wishes to retrieve River once and for all, and so they send an Operative--a cold, intelligent and fearsome warrior, devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do.So many story elements meant to give us more time with each character and to flesh out the story more were cut out for the purpose of making a better movie that flowed more naturally.  This movie would've been far more entertaining had it been played out longer the way it was meant to: on TV.  But all that means is that the most entertaining movie of the year could've been better if it was 18 hours long.  A lot of scenes that were cut, you can watch on this edition as well as the previous single-disc DVD.This movie has something for everyone.  It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's unpredictable, it even has a little romance.  What I really love in a story is the ability to surprise me, catching me completely off guard; this movie has that too.  When I first saw it, this major reveal had my jaw on the theater floor when I realized what had happened.Universal should've released this 2-disc set originally instead of what was released before.  While the original DVD was fine and had plenty of extras and very insightful commentary by Joss Whedon, there was still a sense that there could've been more extras.  There isn't a lot of additional features in this set, so I would have to say this set isn't really warranted.  They should've packed on a little more and it gives me pause before giving the set the 5 stars it deserves.  Alone, it deserves it, but as a second set, it should lose one or two.The original features are entertaining to watch again.  The Fruity Oaty Bars bit has been upgraded from easter egg to regular extra.  I get the sense that not a lot of time was spent on producing this set.  They even reuse the same music and graphics for the menus.  The box is nice and shiny, though.  It looks more like it could hold four discs inside.  That would be very, very nice.  It's still a nice set at a reasonable price that fans will buy no matter what and is a good stocking stuffer for someoene who's been wanting to own Serenity.Someone else mentioned that the new features are also found on an Australian 2-disc edition.  What I know is not on that version is the new commentary recorded March 2007 featuring Joss, Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Ron Glass and Summer Glau.  Normally, a cast commentary leaves you with little other than a feeling that your friends are talking over a movie you like, but Joss keeps most of them grounded and there's plenty of laughs and interesting info.  Ron is mostly quiet and Summer is adorably shy, but put on the spot by Joss often enough to get her out of her shell.Here's a quick synopsis of the other new features:A Filmmaker's Journey - Lots of behind the scenes bits.The Green Clan - A short shout out to Jack Green, the brilliant cinematographer of the film, and the involvement of his sons and daughter with shooting and assisting.Extended Scenes - You get the feeling that, if you had the previous disc, you've seen these before.  When you watch them, though, you realize that they're all new.  They aren't stuffed back into the movie, but are a separate feature, as they should be.Take A Walk on Serenity - A cool short with Joss and the cast talking about the new Serenity set and the little differences between the film and the show.Sci-Fi Inside: Serenity - This is just a special that aired on Sci-Fi Channel to promote Serenity before its release in theaters.  The clip of the film at the end has the sound out of sync for some reason.Session 416 - Amazon says these were ""internet pieces"", but I've never seen them before.  They're pieced together and feel like a short film featuring Summer Glau.  Probably the best feature, showing River's sudden transformation from a bright young girl to what we know her as now."	5.0	Universal should have released only this DVD of the next chapter of Firefly	2007-08-24	11	11	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3D6KZT0QG6UKB	"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press"""	"No. You don't have to see the show to love the movie. No. You won't be bogged down with details. Yes. Joss Whedon does some lovely thing with the camerawork and filming to distinguish this from the television medium that he's been working in forever. Of course this movie is better than Star Wars (pick an episode any episode - yeah that's right, this is better than The Empire Strikes Back) if only on dialogue alone (ok, cheap shot, since really Joss Whedon's dialogue can go toe-to-toe with Oscar Wilde and Quentin Tarantino any day. George Lucas isn't even very good by Hollywood action movie standards.) and Yes, you need to see it immediately.Every year there are movies that fly under the radar, either because of poor distribution or audience expectations, yet they are wonderful and worth seeing. In 2003, the movies were 24 Hour Party People and The Believer. The Princess Bride, Heathers, Blade Runner, Office Space and Velvet Goldmine also needed rediscovery after shoddy box office showing. Serenity, bouyed and crippled by its relation to a failed television show, is one of the 2005 great movies that should have done better.(the other one is Mirrormask).The story is fairly simple. The Alliance is after the ship Serenity in order to retrieve River Tam, a modified psychic who knows more than she should, and sends a very sincere operative after the ship. Captain Malcolm Reynolds is torn between throwing her off the ship because of the danger she represents and discovering her secret. The complexity lies in the characters. Every character in the movie is fully realized and believable. Even the minor characters have their moments of interest.The battle sequences are exciting but they are never inserted to support a weak plot, instead they are integral to the storyline. The future world which is part American, part Chinese, mostly post-Civil War, opens up a vista of opportunities for storytelling that one movie can only hint at.Last word: The extras are mostly useless. Joss Whedon's commentary is full of ""ooh look at the pretty shot, isn't my camera guy cool"" moments. The 'making of' shorts are all about how the fans wanted the movie and how they did. However they repeat ""canceled TV show becomes movie, and that's never happened before"" so often that you want to scream ""STAR TREK"" at the screen. The deleted scenes are pretty good, but the outtakes are terrible (and really bloopers are usually only funny to the people in the show). The best extra is the Easter Egg (on the main menu screen, on the right side there's a button for it) with the Oatie Bar commercial complete with a making of and the commerical in toto - which is definitely the strangest commercial ever."	5.0	The best movie of 2005	2006-01-16	10	10	0

A friend of mine was somewhat obsessed with the series, received in on DVD for his birthday, and made me sit down and watch it. I didn't expect much, but ended up hooked and begging for more by the time the series was over.I first saw 'Serenity' at midnight on the day of its opening, and I have never had a better movie-going experience. The sense of passion, excitement and victory amongst the crowd was something that's rare to experience today. Joss Whedon wrote a film that took us on a rollercoaster ride and left us breathless.I've shown the movie to my friends, and most of them said, ""It was good,"" while a couple loved it. It's a great stand-alone film, but, in all honesty, will probably be much more poignant and meaningful if you've seen the 'Firefly' series. I hate to support Fox, but if you get a chance to watch 'Firefly' first, do it.Otherwise, prepare yourself for an amazing film that BBC voted the #1 movie of 2005.

I honestly assumed it would be on for more than one season but shame on me.  When I saw the movie was coming out I saw it for the sake of seeing something by Joss Whedon on the big screen but initially I had to agree with Frogger's review on the downsides.Then a friend recommended I actually watch the series before opening my big mouth.  Once I did a lot of pieces fell into place.  So, as not to ruin the fun, this movie is good for all Joss Whedon fans or fans of Buffy or Angel BUT you should try to track down someone with the Firefly series so that you aren't confused by seemingly random characters.  If you watch the show the only character that really is just there for the purpose of getting things going and not anywhere in the series is Mr. Universe.. blah. :) I do have to add that you can watch it and it will make sense without having seen the show but watching it does help.The movie was a nice way to answer most of the questions that the show left you wondering about when it went off the air.	5.0	Loved the Movie BUT Recommend watching the series first!	2006-03-24	6	6	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AIRLF4EALH8NQ	"T. Nakamura ""ekalamai"""	I went in seeing Serenity without even knowing it came from the short lived series Firefly. The movie was great, the acting was superb and the storyline flowed nicely. The movie has alot of heart. I saw the movie review and thought it might be an interesting movie. In fact, I had to drag my boyfriend to see this movie since he usually only wants to watch the top selling  movies and when he came out he said it was one of the best movies we've seen in awhile. Better than the Star Wars and most of the other crap movies I've seen in 2005. This movie is the top movie I have seen besides March of the Penguins for 2005.I bought the series Firefly after I saw this movie. I hope they do make a sequel. Nathan Fillion and his cast are wonderful.	5.0	Great movie! Better than Star Wars	2005-12-17	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ALG7QH2L5JL2L	"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series"""	If there's anything I'd like to add to all the good things said about this flick, it's that I wish more people would feel as strongly about the basic evil of any attempts to 'improve' human beings as Joss Whedon does. I happen to share this belief 100%, and it made, for me at least, what might just have been a big-screen 2-hour TV episode into a movie that is worthy being called 'great'.Whedon, knowingly or not, may have ingested a hefty dose of R A Heinlein, or someone like him. I say this because the Firefly characters, and especially the ladies, could have jumped straight out of the pages of a Heinlein story. The actresses cast to represent them are gems, each an every one of them, each in their own way. Kick-ass ladies, each naturally possessed of a sharply-drawn and distinct character, who combine intelligence and strength with an edgy sweetness that's never vacuous. I hope the actresses never have the misfortune to become 'stars', for I get the impression that may be the worst thing that could happen to any actress. But I also hope that they will never have to struggle to find work, preferably in roles where they can enchant their audience as much as they have done in Firefly and Serenity.If Whedon has anything else important to say to us-and I have a notion that he isn't done talking by a long way yet-I hope he does it with another visit to the 'verse and in the company of a bunch of folks I really have come to like.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELDAINNA, and a lot more, soon to be published.	5.0	Serenely superb	2006-03-26	8	7	1

What a great show.  My wife, who has a pathological aversion to all things science fiction and fantasy, actually liked both the series and the movie.  I think the thing that really sets both appart is character development.  A lot of material in this genre is focused on the fictitional ""universe"" created and character development is secondary (or tertiary or nonexistant).  The characters in Serenity and Firefly are the primary focus and they are real, interesting, and funny.  Highly recommended."	5.0	Please, please come back to TV......	2006-02-23	6	5	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"Joss Whedon is one of the most extremely talented people working in the entertainment industry today.  His work on the brilliant television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased Whedon's versatility as both a writer and a director.  That show's spin-off, ANGEL, confirmed that Whedon was anything but a one-hit wonder.  His last series, FIREFLY, proved that he was capable of making most anything excellent.  Unfortunately, that show was cancelled after a mere two months, leading to a huge revolt by angry fans who blamed FOX for the cancellation - and rightly so.  FOX had no advertising campaign for the show, aired it on Fridays (a terrible night for television shows), and showed the episodes out of order.  Now those fans can rejoice: SERENITY, the feature film adaptation of FIREFLY, has arrived.Five hundred years into the future, most planets of the known universe have been colonized and are run by the Alliance, a government which has a strict set of rules intended to make the universe a better, happier place.  Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a veteran of a harsh war against the Alliance, commandeers the spaceship ""Serenity"".  His crew consists of old war buddy Zoe (Gina Torres); her husband and the pilot of Serenity, Wash (Alan Tudyk); the ship's kind, lovable engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite); and tough guy Jayne (Adam Baldwin). The job of Serenity's crew is smuggling, or more often thievery.  The crew gets more than they bargain for when they pick up rich doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his sister, River (Summer Glau).  You see, River is a psychic, and she's being hunted by the Alliance because of something she knows.  Having little luck finding River, the Alliance sends The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a top-notch assassin, to retrieve her.Though it's not essential for one to watch FIREFLY before watching SERENITY, I highly recommend that you do.  For those who decide against it, though, Joss Whedon has done a terrific job of explaining the backstory from the show.  SERENITY opens with a brief explanation of the state of the universe in the future, which Whedon then seamlessly weaves into the storyline.  The sequence in which the characters are introduced is even more brilliant.  Mal Reynolds walks through Serenity, and as he passes each character they engage in conversations just lengthy enough to give us a sense of what each character is like.  In about five minutes, we know and understand each of these characters.  Of course, one gets to know the characters far better while watching FIREFLY.  The fact that the ""companion"" (prostitute) Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) are no longer part of Serenity's crew will mean nothing to those who have not seen the show, however it may shock those who have.While FIREFLY was as much a western as it was a science fiction show, SERENITY belongs solely to the science fiction genre.  It's an old-fashioned sci-fi film, and yet it bears little resemblance to any of the genre's previous films.  You see, SERENITY, like all of Joss Whedon's other works, is entirely original.  There is not a cliche in this movie, nor - unlike STAR WARS - is there any clunky dialogue.  On the contrary, Whedon's script is laced with his trademark wit and originality.Another Whedon trademark is realistic characters, and the characters in SERENITY are certainly realistic.  They're heroes, but certainly not in the traditional sense.  This is particularly evident during a confrontation between Mal and The Operative.  ""I want to resolve this like civilized men,"" says The Operative.  ""I'm not threatening you.  I'm unarmed.""  Mal says, ""Good,"" and without a moment's hesitation draws his gun and shoots him.  Despite this, the crew of SERENITY are most definitely heroes.  They fight for what they believe in, no matter the cost.  They are also distinctly human.  In one scene, Mal and Jayne are arguing.  ""Do you wanna run this ship?"" Mal asks.  Jayne replies angrily, ""Yes!""  Mal hestiates, unsure how to reply.  Finally he pipes up and says, ""Well ... you can't!""As far as filmmaking goes, SERENITY is a very impressive piece of work.  The lighting is as realistic as could be.  David Newman's score is good, and at times its excellent, though it's a far cry from Greg Edmonson's popular score from FIREFLY.  Each member of the cast delivers a great performance.  Particularly delightful is Summer Glau, who makes River seem extremely amusing and wildly unpredictable while also making her someone to pity.  Nathan Fillion is also terrific as Mal Reynolds.  His performance is occasionally reminescent of Harrison Ford's in the original STAR WARS.  Mal is very likable, dedicated, and sometimes clever, but he's human just like everyone else.  Chiwetel Ejiofor turns The Operative into an interesting character who never quite comes across as being dislikable; after all, he's just fighting for what he believes in.  Also of note is Adam Baldwin, who is hilarious as the brutish Jayne.  The only real downside of the film is the editing.  Although for the most part it's very good, the editing at the start of the film seems a little choppy and disjointed.There is one moment in particular that I really loved.  The crew of Serenity has stopped at a bar to get the payoff for their last job.  River looks up a television and smiles.  Suddenly, everything turns blindlingly white and there's total silence.  The camera focuses on River as she whispers one word: ""Miranda"".  The camera then follows River's robe as it slides off her body and she walks away.  Then everything returns to normal and River begins kicking butt.SERENITY is Joss Whedon's big-screen directorial debut, and what an impressive one it is.  It's clear that Whedon has a grip on all the attributes of filmmaking.  SERENITY is an original, intelligent, old-fashioned, and just plain fun sci-fi film that will knock FIREFLY fans' socks off.  Non-fans may enjoy it as well, but it's clear that this was designed for those many people who helped turn the complete series set of FIREFLY into one of the best-selling DVD sets of all time."	5.0	A brilliant, original sci-fi film that'll knock the socks off fans of the series	2006-05-07	9	8	1

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2YKADCJME4FSW	Tom Birkenstock	"I'll preface this review with the fact that I was a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan and over the summer a friend of mine introduced me to the boxed set of Firefly, so I wasn't going into this movie with a blank slate. I will also divulge that I'm a big Joss Whedon fan (except for Alien Resurrection, what the heck?). This review will of course be biased.I'll get through the problems with this film first (there aren't that many). The biggest hurdle that Whedon had in transferring his show into a movie was characterization, and he doesn't quite clear it. There are nine main characters in the show, and how are you going to juggle nine characters in a two hour span when you're used to having years of examining each of their intriguing facet? I have no clue, and apparently neither did Whedon. Whedon's able to differentiate everyone because he's a master of dialogue, but for the uninitiated I don't think the major points of drama in the film will resonate like it will with those who watched the TV show. For those who are familiar with the television show it's really a treat to find out how everything ends(?) (*dun-dunn-dunnn*).As for the rest of the film...it was great! (I was having trouble holding in the inner fanboy). Having a larger budget really allowed Whedon to show what he could do with a bigger brush. I must admit that I was worried Whedon might be too acclimated to television to handle the Big Screen. These worries were thankfully unfounded. Whedon knows how to use action without supplanting the story. There's some good choreography, and he's smart enough of a director to allow the viewers to follow the action instead of substituting quick cuts thinking he'll trick the audience into thinking they're excited. Towards the end the kind of action expands but I never felt I was lost in the spectacle of special effects.This was also a great film for Whedon to showcase his visual talents. With a relatively small budget (I think it was 40 million) he is able to immerse us into a believable and unique world. He is also smart enough to vary the landscape. The viewer is treated to a Hong Kong style city, the familiar border towns, and a place that looks like it came out of Frank Lloyd Wright's imagination.There is a very Whedon feel to this movie. As anyone who has watched Firefly or Buffy knows, when you're watching those shows you feel that not only are you getting to know the characters on screen but the creator behind those characters as well. One of Whedon's great abilities is to make sure the audience is never complacent. For example, the opening consists of a scene where River is being taught at school, but soon we find out that this is going on inside her head and we're really being treated to a scene where her brother Simon is breaking her out of a secret government facility, but wait, this turns out to be merely a surveillance video (hologram?) the villain is watching of their escape. It sounds very clumsy in print, but is used to great effect as the movie's opener. There are plenty of other surprises in the film, but I don't want to spoil anything more.In closing, Firefly fans will probably be more pleased than novices, but whoever you are I guarantee you'll be entertained. Oh, and there's an allusion to ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" and I can't tell you how long I've been waiting to hear that in a science fiction western originating on television."	5.0	For novices: good; for fans: excellent	2006-01-17	5	4	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AGF15YPQVF5V1	Tom Brinston	"Don't believe the people that are giving 5 stars to this horrible movie. This is an overrated film. If you look browse movie websites you will see that this movie has good reviews yet didn't make enough money in theaters. The reason why is because this movie is really horrible and most people decided to ignore this movie completely.I made the mistake of seeing this movie because of the constant overrated score it received in numerous websites. Don't be intrigued to see this movie.About Serenity:I don't even know where to start about how pathetic this film is! I have never even thought about walking out of cinemas due to bad quality of films until I watched this joke of a movie.It's forgettable.It's non-dramatic.It's unappealing.Predictable storyline.The movie is based about a Han Solo wannabe called Capt. Malcolm Reynolds and his crew who rescue a girl named River. This girl apparently as result of her captivity from the future government called ""Interplanetary Alliance ""developed unbelievable combat skills and telepathic abilities.  She has some secrets the government doesn't want everyone to know. But sense they rescued the girl, you know it; the crew struggles for their survival and to keep this girl from government hands. So now that you know the whole story of this movie, get ready for the bad CGI chases, lame jokes, and River using her Kung Fu fighting skills against people four times her size (the only thing missing while she was fighting was having the ""everybody's kung-fu fighting"" song and Luke Skywalker greeting Han Solo wannabe).Don't say I didn't warn you if you buy this movie.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2GY1HRW6Y7EN8	Tommie Lfgren	Lets open up the book, I was a fan of the series when I first saw the pilot and thought the movie was ok. What the movie did for me was some kind of tribute to the series, had everything I hoped for but missed the special character interaction that was in the series. The small pauses that you developed and learned more about them. But as a film, its is one of the best sci-fi movies out there, beating George Lucas recents film on his nose.Serenity (Collector's Edition)'s box is special and beutiful, I cannot say the feeling when I hold it for the first time. The picture is of River, Mal and the ship Serenity and when you open the box. But the utter layer is plastic and contains only the picture of River, and when you open the box left is Mal and Serenity. Like if little synopsis to the story, that River is one way part of the serenity but also a outsider to it. I just love the idea and love the box.So what does the Collectors edition contain you wonder? The film of course, which I describe my opinions above. But what would the collectors edition be if not all the extra content. The collectors edition is 2 disc, and one contains alot of content like documentaries (Sci-Fi Inside), walking through serenity, and interview with Joss. It also contain bloopers and the guerilla marketing campaing of Sesson 416 which is a nice bonus. And also new commentary track by some of the cast. Overall the extra content is intressting and special, and it feels right for being a collectors edition.My opinion about the box is buy it if you are a fan of either collectors editions of DVDs or of the series/movie.	5.0	Most have for collectors and fans	2007-10-04	2	2	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3AAK33K3BUUTM	trashcanman	"If you're already aquainted with the greatness of Joss Whedon's cult television series ""Firefly"" then this is a no-brainer. ""Serenity"" is the best science fiction film since ""The Matrix"" and for true fans of the series, it is a literal dream come true.  Essentially, this film is not so much a stand-alone popcorn affair so much as it is the greatest series finale in history.  It's emotional, funny, action-packed, full of quirky characters both familiar and new, and just plain cool to boot.  There is also a deep philosophical argument explored as the costs of personal freedom and government control are contrasted in a brilliant manner.  Would you choose to live the life of a criminal if it was the only way you could be free?  Does a government have the right to take any step necesssary to keep it's citizens under control and happy?""Half of writing history is covering up the truth"" is just one of the memorable observations made by our heroes over the course of this journey.  The plot centers around insane genius River and her older brother, Simon, who rescued her from a mysterious government facility where she was being experimented on.  Part of the genius of the series (and this film) are the insane rantings of River, which begin to make sense if you pay attention.  ""Old men, covered in blood.  It never touched them but they're drowning in it"" may seem nonsensical to some, but it is a rather poetic yet eerily accurate representation of both the government officials in her universe, and in ours.  The events taking place in this future are vaguely familair as plot devices, but what makes them brilliant is the way they relate to what's happening in our society.  Anyhow, back to the plot: River and Simon joined the crew of Serenity, the ship captained by Malcolm Reynolds, a true hero who isn't afraid to break the rules if it means doing the right thing.  Serenity's crew includes an endearing assortment of contrasting characters that all get their moments to shine in the film: Jayne the hardcore mercenary, Kailee the loveable mechanic, Mal's old war buddy  Zoe, and her pilot/comedian husband Wash are all well represented.  Having left Serenity since the original series, Book the minister and Inara -Malcolm's love interest who happens to be a well-respected prostitute (not to mention unbelievably gorgeous)- turn up along the way as well.The style of the universe that our heroes inhabit is still a mix of all of the cultures of ""Earth-that-was"", primarily american and asian, with cursing in chinese being an amusing device for letting characters express their disapproval realistically and emphatically without getting an ""R"" rating in the process.  If you've never seen ""Firefly"", do not hesitate; go buy it this very moment and see what you've been missing out on, then I can guarantee that this film will blow you away.If you are just looking for a spectacle like ""Star Wars"", legendary action sequences like ""The Matrix"", or just some light sci-fi fare, you will be disappointed.  This movie is both epic and personal, hilarious and heart-breaking, deeply thoughtful yet fun. It represents the fulfillment of a promise from it's creator and is a miracle unto itself that came about simply because the fans refused to let his brilliant creation die just because of a bad decision by a biased television executive.  The story behind the film is almost as uplifting as the film itself and serves to justify those of us who support the things we love, even years after they've ""died"".Not fitting into any particular established pop culture mold -not unlike the characters themselves-, ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" may have flown in under the public's radar, but for those of us who know what great entertainment is capable of, this is the stuff we live for seeing and we're happy to keep it our little secret."	5.0	A criminally underrated conclusion to a criminally underrated series	2007-06-06	378	345	33

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A6VXZ1EEPRTLV	trebe	Created by Joss Whedon (Buffy, Dollhouse), Firefly was a series on FOX that was prematurely cancelled in 2002.  Although 14 episodes of the science fiction adventure were produced, only 11 were aired.  The tale that Whedon had only begun to tell, was not only left hanging, but tossed to the curb like unwanted trash.  If not for Whedon's determination, and the support of a tremendously loyal fan base, Firefly would have gone the way of countless other cancelled shows, appreciated by a few, but soon forgotten and swept into the gutter of TV history.  Thankfully, on the road to obscurity, something truly amazing and wonderful happened, as the series gained a new audience when released on DVD.  Whedon was always determined to finish telling his story, and with the support of Universal Studios, completed a screenplay for the film that would become Serenity.Released in 2005, Serenity is a triumphant return for the crew of the Firefly, and a magnificent achievement on almost all levels.  The film reunites the entire principal cast from the series, and takes quantum leaps forward in the scope of the story, the level of action, and the quality of the special effects.  Within the limits of a feature film, Whedon addresses most of the questions that were left hanging in the TV series.  The movie retains much of the same spirit, but has a darker more deadly serious tone.  Despite budgetary and time constraints, all the critical elements are raised to completely new levels.The focus of the TV series was mostly on the day to day adventures of the crew attempting find jobs and eek out a living.  Serenity however, is mostly about the Alliance's quest to recapture the mysterious River Tam (Summer Glau).  Once a passenger on the spaceship Serenity, the waifish River's importance is tremendously elevated, and her role expanded to include some impressive fight scenes.  Her brother Simon (Sean Maher) also has a larger role, as the crew of Serenity is basically at war with the Alliance, who have sent The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), to lead the attempt to recover River.  Veterans of the Unification War, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres) return to a wartime mode, and put their fighting skills to use.  Fillion also has several extended fight sequences.  Pilot Hoban `Wash' Washburne (Alan Tudyk) shines in the battle sequences in space.  Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) remains a guy you can mostly count on in a fight, while ship's mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite) is still a wiz with gadgets and a spunky fighter.  Unfortunately many scenes between Reynolds and Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin) ended up being cut.  Shepherd Book's (Ron Glass) appearance is brief, but very touching.The backstory of the mysterious Reavers is revealed, when the Serenity arrives at the ghost planet Miranda.  The Reavers play a key role in the climactic finish that ends with a final battle at the headquarters of Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz).  After the Serenity crash lands, the crew prepares for a battle to the death with the Reavers.  The gentlemanly and overly polite Operative, has proven to be a ruthless persecutor, killing anyone that has ever been a friend to the Serenity.  The final act is a montage of mayhem that begins with a battle in space, then features the crew battling the zombie-like Reavers, and sustaining major injuries.  Down below in the generator room, Mal is tangling with The Operative, and manages to leave him speechless.  With most everyone injured, River engages the enemy alone, in a bloody ballet of death.The special effects heavy Serenity, looks absolutely fabulous on Blu-ray.  The special features are prodigious, with several exclusive to the 2008 Blu-ray.  Joss Whedon's presence is extensive, as he provides a solo commentary, and one with members of the cast recorded in 2007, that can also be viewed as inserted video onscreen.  Whedon discusses why the deleted scenes were cut, as well as many of the other decisions he made regarding the plot, and why not all the characters survive.With Whedon's focus clearly on telling a story galactic in scope, certain sacrifices had to be made, and Serenity is mostly a tale of war, with scant time for romance.  While the film may not totally satisfy the desires of all hardcore fans, it does a very good job of covering most of the high points, and winding up most of the loose ends, as Whedon was not counting on doing another sequel.  As over five years have passed, it seems that he made a wise choice.  Predictably, the cast are all fabulous, particularly Nathan Fillion (Castle) and Summer Glau (Terminator: The Sara Connor Chronicles).  Serenity is a straight ahead action/adventure where the nuances included for the fans, still allow for it to be enjoyed by those who have never seen Firefly.  It's science fiction that is done right, not dumbed down for the masses.	5.0	where are you hiding little girl?	2011-05-15	3	3	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AIX7YZJWFV3DF	Trevor F. Rawlinson	The show Firefly was really good.  After one season they cancelled the show; the movie although good really doesn't answer all the questions we have.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	Despite initially being somewhat put off seeing it by the rabid behavior of some of the more fanatical fans of the series, Serenity was easily the most enjoyable of this year's admittedly disappointing crop of Summer movies, so naturally it proved a box-office flop despite its modest budget. As if aware that this probably was a last shot deal, Joss Whedon manages to provide a genuinely satisfying finale to the dominant plot-thread of the series that leaves just enough of an opening for further adventures if the DVD sales pick up. But beyond that, he takes some surprising chances, particularly his willingness to kill off key cast members (one of the few areas where seeing the TV series actually is necessary: without their backstories it's unlikely their genuinely unexpected deaths would be quite so affecting), providing a sci-fi movie that's not just sassy and funny but also surprisingly touching as well. Certainly in the film's final moments you get a real sense that this has been made with real love for the characters and the setting rather than by focus groups and merchandizing arms, something long missing from sci-fi movies: the final lines could just as easily apply to the film's box-office rivals as they do to the Serenity.Some of the regular cast members do tend to get sidelined, it's true, but never to the extent that you feel cheated - not least because it avoids the Star Trek movies trap of adding redundant big scenes for each of the fan favorites to lure them back. And in Chiwetel  Ejiofor's Operative, very much a logical evolution of Richard Brook's calmly pathological bounty hunter in the Firefly episode Objects in Space, he creates an intriguing villain, a true believer with a coldly rational mind, regarding himself as a necessary and monstrous evil creating a world without sin in which he will have no place.The setpieces are both fun and ingenious (not least the way they manage to break through the bad guys' blockade) but not without consequences, and the big secret at the heart of the conspiracy actually makes sense. The only slight minus was the addition of sound effects to the space sequences, when their appropriately silent small screen equivalents seemed so much more novel and memorable. Eminently shiny.The extras are good, but be warned that there will apparently be even more extras on the UK and, especially, Australian DVDs.	5.0	Surprisingly entertaining and eminently shiny	2006-01-12	10	10	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3MV8FXSCDU2OY	T. S. Potter	"For Non-Fans:Though it's not essential that you see the series FIREFLY before you watch this movie, I would HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend it because it will enrich your experience of it ten-fold. These 9 crew members function in very specific ways for very specific reasons, both as individuals and as a group. Though the movie does do an admirable job of giving you the ""crash course"" in roll-call, nothing can replace the experience of getting to know and love each and every one of these characters one episode at a time. Those of us who saw this movie having already seen the TV show went in with great affection and genuine concern for the fate of its characters. Were it up to me, no one would be permitted to see this without first seeing the show. Rent it, buy it, borrow it... However you get your hands on it (notice I didn't say steal it), it's worth the time and the money. The reviews of FIREFLY on this website alone can attest to that.Those of you that have seen and enjoyed the TV show have most likely already seen this movie, so I won't take up anyone's time by comparing the two. There's no shortage of websites debating this issue already.For fans:SPECIFIC TO THIS DVDThe introduction by Joss Whedon, for those of us who couldn't make it to the pre-screenings, is particularly touching and immediately reminds the fans exactly why we love these people.The commentary... I was annoyed to the point of being nearly angry. Perhaps I just haven't learned yet what to expect from a dvd commentary. I wanted to hear why Joss made specific character choices and different plot-related explanations. The cupboard was all but bare. If you want to know what kind of light or camera lens was used, this commentary is for you. If you want to know anything about character development or to hear Joss comment on the significance of what's happening in a given scene, you will most likely be sorely disappointed. Practically none of the issues on which the fans would want to hear comments were discussed. The significance of a certain pilot was skimmed over at best. I was horribly disappointed and would have expected far more.The features are pleasant enough and the extended scenes are well worth watching. As a fan, I'm obviously happy to own this movie. My only true disappointment is the commentary."	4.0	Commentary = 2, Movie = 5	2005-12-20	0	0	0

Stewart ""moviemancritter"""	"It wasn't suppose to happen like this...Back in the summer of 2001, Fox announced that ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" mastermind Joss Whedon would be creating a new television show that was a cross between Science Fiction and the Western Genres... For months Fox spent millions of dollars promoting the one ""sure fire series of the season"" but then the problems started... the pilot was too slow, Executive Heads Clashed, and Baseball season all got mixed into the mixing pot... and in the end fans where left with an out of order, mixed up, tale of identitify (which is ironic if you think about it).But the fans of Joss Whedon and of the character he creates would not let this be the end of the ""firefly"" universe, and after much fanfare, petitions, and literal Bitching; Universal Pictures did something rather uprecidented: they green lite a ""big-screen' movie which Joss Whedon describes as ""a thank you to the fans.""And that is exactly what the film version of ""Serenity"" is.  On the exterior it is a fast-past, character driven, science fiction blast for everyone to enjoy, and the people that did see it did enjoy it alot.  It has survived over a month on IMDB's Top 250 Movies of All Tilme List, and has recieved glowing reviews from THE NEW YORK TIMES, EBERT & ROBERT, THE SAN FRANSISCO CHRONICLE, and more... I distinctly remember a quote from the New york Times saying ""George Lucas eat your heart out.""But on the interior the movie was about the salvation of people, and it was a political commentary on big brotherism, and how if things in our society today keep going down the same road are future generations won't be much different from mal and zoe.If your a fan of science-fiction or just good storytelling this is a movie for you."	5.0	You Can't Stop the Signal	2005-11-02	333	311	22

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"This is a review from a man who has not seen the original short-lived TV series `Firefly.' I am a fan of sci-fi films, however, and I happened to notice many positive reviews about `Serenity,' so I gave it a try.It is a pleasant surprise because the film is so good. Characters are lively, the dialogues are snappy and occasionally funny, and the film's story is intriguing. The special effects are very good (though some still need improvement), but what is remarkable about the film is the wits of the creator Joss Whedon who manages to keep telling this good, old Western-like adventure tale without making it too serious or self-referential.In short, this is what a good action film should be, and you can enjoy watching it without knowing anything about the history of the production. The film is about the crew of one spaceship in the future, and one ruthless `Alliance Operative' (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""Kinky Boots"") chases them, trying to retrieve a mysterious girl named River. The back story of the future world and the characters are cleverly explained in the opening, so you don't have to read long subtitles to understand them.Like many other TV series that are loved by us for generations, ""Serenity"" presents the credible relations between the flawed but likable characters through a series of slightly episodic actions, and those relations are what really matters. Unfortunately, 2 hours are not enough for full character development, and some of them need more time for that. So my only complaint about the film is, I want more."	5.0	Thrilling and Clever Sci-Fi Action with Heart: My Only Complaint is, I Want More of This	2007-02-06	3	3	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1F9Z42CFF9IAY	T. Tom	I am one who bought into all the hype that this is actually a good movie-it isn't. The acting seems robotic and I don't think the characters are supposed to be robots. (Heck, Lance Henrickson's character Bishop in the Alien movies has like double the personality of any of the characters in Serenity and Bishop is a robot.) I don't know if this is attributable to bad acting, bad directing, or both in Serenity.The whole movie plays like one of those bad Saturday afternoon movies that you start watching because nothing else is on, but then fall asleep to. I don't really have a problem with the way the actors look, the women (and maybe the men) look sexy. Also the visual effects are not bad. The story and premise is completely lacking. Why would the crew of Serenity continue to keep River on board once they know she is a weapon? They complain and whine to each other about it but never do anything about it-doesn't make any logical sense.Also the 2nd A.D. work in Serenity is really bad.	2.0	Not that good	2007-03-12	21	2	19

Too bad I didn't open it before I could return it. One of the DVDs had fallen out of the package and was all scratched up.  But that only that, it has some weird defect spot on it that was probably done in making the DVD and I think that causes it to pause here and there during the first 15 minutes or so.  It never stopped totally so I watched it.Another thing bad about the design is that there is a graphic on the back that is really nice looking of River and company. So  I wanted to take the piece of paper off the back that the company put on there to explain what was on the discs and I ripped off a good deal of the top inch or so of the paper of the back graphic, so now it has ripped paper on the top and bottom. Why couldn't the company put the description piece of paper on the outside of the DVD box?  That way when you took the shrink wrap off, the back of the box wouldn't be damaged.I love Serenity and Firefly, I just wish I had a movie DVD that didn't stop and wasn't flawed be it I bought it new and shrink wrapped and I also wish the back was rip free.	1.0	The packaging on this set is really horrible...one DVD was messed up and the back paper is glued to the graphic on the back...	2009-09-07	43	3	40

For me that comes in the form of Jewel Staite ;-) and the rest of the cast of 'Serenity'This is the film continuation of the sci-fi cult show 'Firefly' as it loosely picks up where the show left of and takes on an epic adventure. Joss Whedon obviously had something here as he gathered his cast of space cowboys back for one last ride. A ride that leads to secrets revealed, fan satisfactions given and a few unexpected and saddening twists all for the soul purpose of giving this original fan favorite epic the proper send off that it deserved.This is definitely up there for me among sci-fi cult classics like 'The Fifth Element' 'Tron' and 'Akira' a film that is rich in character development and story and keeps you entertained from beginning to end. I definitely plan to add this film to my collection and can only wonder if there is some kind of future for the rag-tag crew of Serenity.	5.0	A sci-fi treasure and the perfect send off (Part 2 of 2)	2014-03-29	0	0	0

It also avoids the cynical game of ""plot tweeking by the studio marketing department"". The wisecracking crew of lost boys and girls trying to outmanuever the creepy-polite operative is entertaining, and good comedy.The real magic is taking wild twists on familiar ground. Cliches are turned inside-out, but this cleverness never sterilizes its emotional core, the characters. Each one is presented with their failings in the foreground. The heros don't have infinite confidence and neat certainties. And that's the point of the story, trying to engineer people into an idea of perfection is a very bad thing. (German transcendentalists be warned: this is the opposition's arguement, with spaceships.) But noodling out underlying meanings isn't required, it's perfectly enjoyable at face value.Serenity suffered from being released in the midst of the post summer movie hangover of late September, so it's box office gross doesn't reflect it's quality. This DVD's December release makes it a perfect antidote to the emotionally saccharine, Oscar-wannabe holiday fare."	5.0	Fun Smart Funny	2005-11-04	8	8	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ATY5FZW5SJ63H	"Valentin Gurerro ""Broken Machine"""	One beautiful unemployed day I figured what the heck I have no job to go to anymore and I have Netflix, maybe I should take a chance and rent a series. Thankfully I had rented Firefly, just weeks after it was cancelled from the Gorram Fox station. Even though I thought I wouldn't enjoy the show because I'm no great Sci-Fi fan I ended up loving it so much I bought the set and then spent the rest of my time talking about the show to anyone that would listen to me. Since then I roamed the browncoats network looking for tid bits about this show hoping that it would be ressurected by maybe the sci-fi channel (who opted to pass inorder to get the Tremors series, yeah good move dummies) thus the whole idea of a major motion picture was born, thanks in part to people like me who spent their hard earned cash on the set making it one of the highest selling on Amazon. When the flick came out I loved it. Loved it so much I saw it more then once. Loved it so much I just had to have the three part series of comic books that gapped the time between the final Firefly episode (Objects In Space) and the film (Serenity). Needless to say I was a tad bit dissapointed with the comics (basically you learn that a villain from the first episode lives and wants revenge and that Book leaves because he is forgetting himself and eventually kills someone). Regardless of how this DVD is done up (outtakes, deleted scenes, what have you) I would buy it simply because the film is one of the best. In the end though you'll hear all about how this film didn't make enough money but once again I have to blame the money men. I hardly recall seeing a preview for this film and when I did it took the movie completely out of context. Years of horrible movies coming out and an overall box office slump probably played a part as well but if anything rent this film and I gaurantee you'll find yourself owning it and maybe even the Firefly set for good measure. On one final note you can catch the Serenity soaring the skies in the Battlestar Galactica mini-series (the series FX is done by the same company) for about 30 seconds.	5.0	One Shiny Flick	2005-11-09	12	10	2

I was frustrated when I learned the show had been cancelled after only 1 season. But found solace and consolation in the Serenity Movie. If you are a fan of the series, you MUST watch the movie to tie the knots and allow yourself to find closure.

Well, I was glad that they did. This movie had me fall in love with all the characters in the story line and then also in the story line too. I enjoyed both the male and female roles and this is usually not the case for me. The name ""Serenity"" is the name of the spaceship that finds itself home for everyone. The way that the spaceship looked and was laid out was great to look at. The plot lines of the movie was great and I suggest you see the TV shows first (named ""Firefly"" after the type of spaceship that Serenity is designed as). The TV shows will give you a lot of insight on the characters and how they interact and this makes the movie much more enjoyable. I purchased both the seasons for Firefly and the movie; something I rarely do. I feel that there is so much good stuff out there why would I want to take up the time watching something more that at least twice. But I know that I will watch all of these many more times that two as I have a not so secret crush on the main character, Mal.

This time a great (if tragically short-lived) television series spun off a better movie.""Firefly"" was Joss Whedon's very best television show; Fox network decided it had better things to do with the time slot, like another moronic reality show, or much less worthy science fiction offerings like the anemic ""Fringe.""""Firefly"" was a big, brawny, brainy amalgam of western and science-fiction series - which doesn't do it justice by any means.  It was ""Star Trek"" with guts, verve, hormones and nowhere near the faith in big government and big space navies.  It is seamy, profane in spots (though the writers took care to have their futuristic outlaw crew say ""Gordam"" when taking the Deity's name in vain and do the rest of their swearing in strongly accented Common Tongue Chinese), misanthropic, howlingly funny, bitterly sad, sometimes all at once.And the movie it spawned, Serenity, is even better than that.  It continues the saga of Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), captain of the transport Serenity, veteran of the bitter war between the Alliance of Planets and the independent worlds who vainly resisted being brought under harmonious pan-human tyranny, and his cheerful crew of smugglers and petty crooks, a courtesan, a priest and a brilliant brother and sister on the run from the Alliance government.  All the fun folks we loved so well from Firefly, plus new characters, some you'll love, some you won't love so much, some you won't care for at all.Serenity came after the cancellation of Firefly, after the hoarse cries of rage from science fiction fandom which made the welkin ring at Comic-Con and other fan conventions made it clear that there was at the very least a movie left in the franchise.And it towers high over the TV series - Serenity begins in media res, right in the middle of the action Firefly fans know and love, but soon vaults over even that high standard to tell a story with fast-paced action, with immediacy, humor, and passion.The characters are the same ones we remember from the TV series - but more alive, fully-engaged... and it is the fitting capstone to that series, the cast earned their pay and gave us a ringing valedictory.  It sews up many loose ends, gives us reason to cheer and weep... inflicts pity and terror and vindication on its audience.  It's an adventure epic, a spy story, a fantasy/science fiction masterpiece, and more than any of that, it's the very best thing Joss Whedon ever set his hand to.Watch it and mourn that there will be no more from the cask.  Then go buy a brown coat."	5.0	"""I aim to misbehave.... """	2010-09-14	3	3	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1ULFDXVXS2ALX	Victoria A. Grossack	"Have you ever  started a fabulous book, engaging, well-written, and then have it disappear before you could finish reading it?  The cancellation of Firefly, an incredible series, was one of the most frustrating and cruel decisions ever made by network.  Fabulous acting, great stories, many questions unanswered - and then the rug pulled out before they were finished.But because the fans demanded it, eventually Whedon's miracle arrived, and a movie was made.  We could attribute this to the powers of love and belief, both explicit themes in the movie.A movie is not the same as a television series.  A movie needs more scope, so instead of the ragtag group of individuals trying to scavenge a living and survive without being detected, which was part of the charm of the series, we get to watch them fighting, essentially, two armies.  Devoted fans may also not need some of the exposition.Some little things that I love about both the series and the movie is the use of language.  The dialogue is fantastic: witty, funny, sometimes very apt.  Whedon, like Humpty-Dumpty, is a master of the words he uses, bending them to his will. There's ""shiny"" and ""companion"" and ""nethers"".  And perhaps, my favorite, the use of the word ""'verse"" to mean ""universe"" - but which of course also has the poetical meaning of the story.Not all the threads left hanging from the series are tied up, but many of them are.  We learn a lot more about River.  We resolve the relationship between Simon and Kaylee.  Mal recovers his belief system.  We have a more sensible explanation for Reavers.  We don't get the background on Inara or Shepherd Book, but at least with the latter he says he's not going to give his life story.The movie starts and ends with discussions of love.  We first learn the love that Simon has for his sister, recognized by, of all people, the movie's main antagonist, the nameless operative.  The nameless operative also understands the power of belief.  The operative is therefore in a better position than Mal at the movie's beginning.  However, the operative is too committed to unquestioning belief and because of this he does things that he admits make him a monster.  Mal, during the movie, also learns to believe again - but his commitment to this is based on a more thorough investigation.  There's a wonderful exchange, in which the nameless operative asks Mal if he is ready to die for his beliefs.  Mal says, ""Yes - but that ain't exactly Plan A.""I do have some quibbles.  Jewel Staite lost the 20 lbs that she gained for her original stint as Kaylee.  Perhaps she's more beautiful without the 20 lbs, but she no longer feels like Kaylee.  And although I can imagine Kaylee and Simon getting together - they're both good people - they really don't feel like a good match.  Also, there seems to be no resolution to Jayne's story.  He finally gets to be considered a genuine hero and perhaps that should have been acknowledged.Nevertheless a wonderful movie and a tribute to the faith of the fans and Firefly's creators."	5.0	The power of belief	2013-07-24	2	2	0

Well besides Batman Begins this was my favorite movie of 2005. It was 2 solid hours of entertainment. Writer/Driector Joss Whedon knows how to blend action and drama with a range of emotions thrown it for a total package. I could go on and on but the simple truth is that this is a very good Sci-Fi film, probably one of the best in years. This is a rich universe that is real and tangible. I have turned on several people to the world of Serenity and they were all hooked by the end of the film. You don't have to know the back story before seeing the movie...it's all explained within.

Although it's a science fiction genre the movie like the series before, is a bit of a western in space which isn't a bad thing.Serenity expands on much of the premises of the series filling out the foundation of the Reivers and bringing River's character to it's fullest extent. The storyline is excellent, with Mal, his crew and his passengers conducting shady dealings like payroll heists but, true to their pasts idealists as well.The movie is great fun and certainly one of the best science fiction films of the last few years.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1GO0HC3RZ5Z4M	Vivek Hurry	After eons, here's a riproaring, swashbuckling sf adventure that you'll want to watch again even as the end credits roll across the screen. This is not a philosophical sf movie a la the exquisite Contact or Gattaca or The Matrix (the first one only). It's more Indiana Jones meets Star Wars, and Star Wars itself was a space-frontier Western meets Bollywood sans dancing, so what does that make this? Who cares! Climb aboard for a fun ride.If I were to recite the story it would probably read as a litany of every sf cliche in the book (or rather movie world) except for time travel - ragtag band of desperados roaming the galaxy in a rustbucket of a spaceship, fleeing the all powerful Alliance, robbing banks and heading to Haven to rest up, drawing philosophical sustenance from the Shepherd, encountering evil quasi-aliens called Reavers who specialize in eating humans - alive, a mysterious girl with weird powers whom the Alliance will do anything to kill, a reclusive geek, the wonderfully nicknamed Mr. Universe who monitors (and can control) the broadcasts across the galaxy, secret subliminal messages in TV advertisements. Anything sound familiar in that? Sure it does.You've seen this a hundred times before from Star Wars, the Matrix, Minority Report, the Fifth Element and... you get the point.But the magic of this movie is that it takes all these hoary standards, stirs them up and comes up with something that is fresh, original and bucketloads of fun. I suspect part of the exuberance has to do with the casting - not a marquee name in the bunch, but all eminently suited to their roles. And the script - laconic, dry humor in all the right places: the James Bond screenwriters should take lessons from these guys. And the action and effects - topnotch, edge-of-your-seat, stomach-in-your-mouth stuff. And the characters: the cynical yet idealistic Mal, captain of the Serenity; the hard-as-nails, curiously named Jayne, ever ready to lob a grenade at the enemy; the smart second mate whose name eludes me (Gina Torres, now where have I seen her before?) and the exquisite little River Tam (River - Reaver, any connection?) who makes The Bride of Kill Bill look like a pacifist wuss.I have promptly put Firefly, the TV series that spawned this movie, onto my wishlist for future purchases. This appears to be the second great sf TV-movie combo I've encountered: the first was Stargate which begat Stargate SG-1. But that's another review.	5.0	Anything but Serene, and it rocks!	2006-07-16	10	7	3

Oh, wait. Yes I am."" And he went on to say, ""So stop reading this. Go get your tickets. See this movie.""Dom, of Mega Tokyo, the incredibly popular web comic, said, ""And, without having any experience with Joss Whedon's writing style, without having any prior knowledge of anything that had ever happened in Firefly, I watched the movie."" He went on to say, ""The dialogue was clever, but only when it would be most effective, and the jokes never seemed cheap. The movie was excellent at changing gears from tension to humor to action, and for perhaps the first time in years, I was actually at the edge of my seat sometimes instead of slouching back.""""An A-grade experience. The writing is impeccable, the chemistry among the cast is fantastic, the performances are great, and the action is non-stop!"" Clint Morris from MOVIEHOLE stated.Richard of TheMovieBlog.com says, ""That is indeed the key to this movie, Whedon's writing, it's superb. The dialogue is sharp, witty, quickfire and sarcasm filled. He's also got a great understanding of how to pull the audience's strings. Tension, suspense and impending danger often twist around in a shocking or explosive moment delivering a good deal of the entertainment value. He's without a doubt a great writer and director and he shows it here, he's a great entertainer.""Without a doubt this movie is incredible. Great acting, writing, cinematography, the whole works.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ALHC64J88LVWO	Wayfinder	In this review I discuss not the movie, but this product offering.  The movie rocks; goes without saying.But I buy BluRay for significantly better picture.  This is only marginal quality.  Imo the DVD is nearly as good.  Since I had the Collector's edition already, I find little value in this offering.  If you don't already own the Collector's edition, sure, get this BluRay. If you do, you may wind up considering this a waste of money.  The quality just isn't that impressive.That said, I was pleased to find this is the Collectors edition (which I'd wondered about).  It comes with some nice additional features... IF your BluRay machine can handle it.  If your machine is older than a year as of this writing, you probably won't be able to use the fancies that come with the BluRay edition (such as the ship blueprints, which require PIP capability).So only giving this three stars. This doesn't even come close to the significant improvement of the BluRay version of AVATAR (the BluRay version of AVATAR is definitely worth the upgrade).  In Serenity, I think the transference quality could have been sharper, better, more defined.So movie, 5 stars, BluRay quality 3 stars (if that).	3.0	Blu-Ray poor quality	2010-12-18	8	7	1

Even with a heavyweight director like Robert Wise ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" did well at the box office critically the film became the Titanic with its long ponderous shots of V'Ger and the long lingering affectionate gaze at the Enterprise. Few TV properties truly make the jump to the big screen well so I was surprised and elated that ""Serenity"" Joss Whedon's (""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"") film extension of his TV show ""Firefly"" actually was very good. Fans of the show turned out in droves and critically it was a success but the theater seats were empty for most of its showings. That's too bad because Whedon does a nice job of giving a backstory to nonfans and still manages to capture the flavor of the TV show.Set centuries in the future the transport vessel Serenity commanded by Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion who comes the closest to channeling the spirit of Han Solo since Harrison Ford) is smuggling more than contraband-they're carrying a River Tam (Summer Glau) who has been altered by the government to become a brilliant killing machine and they want her back. Her brother Simon (Sean Maher) fakes his way into the facility where she's being kept and rescues her he spirits her off in the Serenity. The Alliance sends a nasty operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who will stop at nothing to obtain River including murdering anyone who stands in his way not just because of what she can do but also because of what she knows about illicit experiments the Alliance has been conducting since its formation. Mal bonded with Zoe (Gina Torres), her husband and pilot of the Serenity Walsh (Alan Tudyk), engineer Kaylee (Jewel Straite) and Jayne (Adam Baldwin) during the Brown Coat War for independence (Whedon was inspired to create the backstory for ""Firefly"" from the conflict during the Civil War and other incidents in U.S. history) Unfortunately, the pursuit of the Alliance puts the crew of Serenity at odds with River and Simon and they begin to wear out their welcome.Featuring a stellar cast, ""Serenity"" is a rarity in that it makes the transition to the big screen effortlessly and Whedon manages to clue in those who didn't follow the series with a breathtaking opening sequence that illustrates things fans were told had occurred during the first season but never saw. I suppose ""Firefly"" fans can satisfy themselves with the fact that they got their movie which essentially crams the story arc Whedon had planned for the second season into a two hour feature film. Sadly, the film stiffed at the box office despite a terrific campaign by Universal to attract both the hardcore Brown coat audience (so called because of the colors Mal's troops wore during the Civil War with the Alliance). It's unlikely we'll see another ""Firefly"" TV show or movie. Since Whedon wraps things up but also leaves the door open the film manages to work both ways for fans by providing closure to one of the main story points of the first season and opening up possibilities (which no doubt will continue in novels and comic books) for further adventures. ""Serenity"" manages to be that rare thing in science fiction films; a kick-ass adventure with some thought behind it. While some of the plot points that are revealed in ""Serenity"" are a bit predictable the film manages to combine the best elements of space opera and science fiction to create valentine for fans of the show.""Serenity"" looks extremely good on this DVD with the original theatrical presentation of the film well represented. The colors are vivid and bright where appropriate and the clarity of the image exceedingly good. The one area that this transfer could improve is to eliminate the edge enhancement that appears in some of the high contrast sequence action sequences shot for the film. The 5.1 Dolby Digital presentation of the film nicely captures the active soundtrack from the theatrical exhibit of the film. Dialogue comes across crisp and clear while action sequences don't have the compressed muddy sound that I've seen in some recent releases.While the film looks and sounds very good, the extras leave a lot to be desired which makes me suspect Universal will be re-releasing this in a double dip edition later next year. I don't have news but I suspect the sales of this set will determine if an enhanced edition comes out next year (or perhaps Universal is holding that for the Blu-Ray edition that is no doubt in preparation for next year). We get three featurettes on the series the best of which ""Future History: The Story of Earth That Was"" clocks in at around 5 minutes. Whedon talks to the camera here explaining how he came up with the concept for the show. ""What's in a Firefly"" focuses on the optical effects with Whedon and members of the visual effects team discussing how they conceived some of the best visual sequences. ""Relighting the Firefly"" is the longest of the three at about 10 minutes and covers the resurrection of the show from the graveyard of cancelled TV shows. ***CAUTION THERE IS A SPOILER AHEAD ABOUT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FILM AHEAD. SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM***While each featurette is of solid quality Universal should and could have done a separately disc of extras covering everything from what made it into the movie that was planned for the non-existent second season to Whedon's controversial decision to eliminate some of the major cast members for this film.Whedon's chatty commentary definitely ranks as the highlight of the extras included for me. The discussion of his thought process behind the film's plot and how he tied in various points from the series was refreshingly frank and fascinating to listen to. Whedon's impish sense of humor also gets a nice airing in his discussion on making the film.While the fact that this is truly the end of the ""Firefly"" saga will be a bitter pill for fans to swallow, Whedon delivers a truly stunning valentine with ""Serenity"" channeling the major plot points for a planned second season that never materialized. The image quality and transfer of ""Serenity"" is quite good but the extras a bit disappointing particularly compared to many lesser films that receive a DVD release. Whedon's commentary remains a highlight of this set. Definitely worth buying if you're a fan of the series although I'd suggest nonfans who haven't seen the TV show might want to rent some of the first season DVD boxed set to get a sense of the flavor of the show before buying."	5.0	"Closure for ""Firefly"" fans"	2005-12-19	29	26	3

Castro ""Sci Fi Fantasy loving Romantic"""	"I understand that everyone is going to have their own ideas about this movie and the ""Firefly"" series. Let me tell you my point of view. I was one of the unfortunate ones who never got to see the series. I was always too busy and I figured I'd get around to it. One day my family came into the very end of Serenity on HBO. We certainly didn't recognize it but being sci-fi and action fans loved it immediately. I got it and we watched it from the beginning and instantly loved the movie. After seeing the end, watching it through, things made so much more sense. This movie stands alone very well without the backstory. Of course, the history helps explain certain things and helps you to understand the characters, but this movie certainly holds it's own. Then, I learned that it was based on ""Firefly"" the series. Now, I had to get the series. Well, I can't stop watching it. This series is very smart. These people are all on their own, cut off from society. In this type of a situation, it's human nature to adapt to a new way of life, even a new way of speaking whether it be developing a new dialect or reverting to ""cowboy"" ways because you are so cut off from the mainstream that you do what you can to survive. It's too bad the networks couldn't see it for what it was. I'm not much of a t.v watcher because I feel there's not much worth watching, especially during prime time on the networks.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"""Like Star Wars if everyone were Han Solo.""  That was how a friend of mine described Joss Whedon's Firefly and Serenity to me a couple months ago before loaning me the DVD's.  And his description was pretty accurate, but it comes nowhere near doing this classic slice of pop culture justice.  While it's well known by now that Firefly was cancelled before its time, Serenity translates the genre-bending comedic action-sci-fi-western hybrid of the show to the cinematic medium, and brilliantly at that.  Serenity is a great movie by virtually any standard, but it's precisely great movies like this one (and Bubba Ho-Tep, and Shaun of the Dead, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, etc.) that are generally denied the recognition they deserve.  It's not flashy or pandering enough for mainstream appeal, and not pretentious or self-important enough for the Oscar crowd.  However, while it's not AN IMPORTANT MOVIE like Million Dollar Baby or Brokeback Mountain (neither of which I've seen, and I intend to keep it that way), Serenity is a fast-paced, funny, and beautifully-filmed watch whose economical dialogue and plentiful action make its two-hour running time feel more like one.Serenity manages to both pick up where Firefly left off and fill in some more of the backstory, continuing to follow the crew of the Serenity--tough-guy captain and former rebel officer Mal Reynolds; the husband-and-wife combo of devil-may-care pilot Hoban Washburn and no-nonsense first mate Zoe; brutish, self-interested warrior Jayne Cobb; cute, tomboyish mechanic Kaylee Frye; smoking-hot companion (aka high-class call girl) Inara Serra; and trauma surgeon Simon Tam and his psychic sister River--around the outer reaches of known space as they try to find work while steering clear of the fascistic Alliance authorities and cannibalistic Reavers.  One might think there would be some compromises to be made in bringing a beloved cult show to the big screen, but with Whedon on board as both writer and director, that's not a problem here.  The conversion to the new format provides Serenity with the nifty effects and grandiosity befitting its status as a modern space opera, but without compromising any of the wit, intimacy, and heart that made Firefly a great show (one might be tempted to note in passing that it was precisely these qualities that George Lucas's mega-budgeted Star Wars prequels largely lacked, but I won't).  The movie is somewhat darker, more violent, and more plot-oriented than the show, but it's all for a good cause, as Serenity goes a long way toward resolving several of Firefly's main plot strands, most notably the origins of the Reavers and River's importance to the Alliance.While it was already well-established that River was a tormented psychic super-genius, the movie reveals the true extent of her abilities early on when she cuts a deadly swath through the patrons of a crowded bar with some martial-arts moves that would make Bruce Lee blush.  It's no surprise, then, when the crew of the Serenity finds itself pursued by a sword-wielding operative dispatched to hunt down River and eliminate anyone in his way.  In the only major role created solely for the movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor (cool name) is creepily effective as the nameless operative, whose ruthlessly calculating demeanor and considerable skills in the deadly arts are matched by his singleminded, unreflecting devotion to his cause.  Ironically enough, the movie also sees Mal's wartime idealism, previously submerged beneath the hardnosed, me-and-mine-first pragmatism necessitated by his postwar career, starting to reemerge as the extent of the Alliance's perfidies comes into clearer focus.  I'll readily admit that I'm a sucker for plots that pit the little guys against the forces of an oppressive, faceless government, but even so Serenity's conception of heroism and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds should resonate with pretty much anybody.Even better, Serenity ends on a rather open note, leaving plenty of room for another installment.  Granted, this movie didn't exactly set the box office on fire, but given the brisk DVD sales anything's possible.  I for one wouldn't mind seeing another western-themed comedic space opera from Whedon, but in any case Serenity's classic status is guaranteed.  I for one found this to be easily one of the most intelligent, original, and entertaining movies of the decade.  5 stars for sure."	5.0	"""If you can't do something smart, do something right."""	2006-03-05	12	12	0

The buzz and sales of the DVD were good enough to get studio execs to not only listen but to let Whedon do the show his way.  Welcome to Serenity.Serenity is the name of the ship our heroes are gallivanting the galaxy in.  Heroes is almost too strong a word as we see that they are a bunch of outlaws.  Like most westerns though (that's right western), the good guys are in a shade of grey.  Self preservation and profit tops their priorities, but when the chips are down Mal, the captain, and his crew cannot help but to do the right thing.What makes this movie truly great is not the plot (although a very high point), but the characters.  You truly grow to love the characters and the relationships they have with each other.  The sexual tension between the characters, most fans of the series are already familiar with, is made apparent without flat out telling the audience that it is supposed to be there.  The characters fall back into their roles from the series effortlessly, and it is obvious that they have worked with each other a lot.  The characters are not one dimensional, they have complex reasons for what they do and you get to see them weighing their options on screen.  The crew reacts not as individuals, but as family.  Which is exactly what you would get with a small group of people in such proximity for such a long time.Now on to the plot.  The story centers around the character of River (Summer Glaus), a telepath that was made that way by the alliance, the governing body of the solar system.  Her brother, Simon, breaks her out of the hospital where the alliance is performing the experiments.  The TV show, Firefly started at this point.  The movie starts at a much later point after Simon and River have been on the ship for about a year.  The alliance is out to silence River and whatever government secrets she may know.The story was the easy part and could be redone in any number of action movies, but the relationship that the characters have with each other make this a marvel.  The dialogue is fresh and funny.  The graphics are clean and beautiful.  This movie has been deemed the new Star Wars and for good reasons.  This is the Movie that Lucas wanted episode III to be, this is the chemistry that was absent between Padme and Anakin.  Serenity is the torch bearer for all new science fiction.  Joss Whedon and the thespians, yes thespians, that played their roles have raised the standard by which all scifi shall henceforth be judged,  Serenity is to Movies, what Battlestar Galactica and Lost are to TV.	5.0	The new standard	2005-10-04	12	11	1

A lot of the people I've talked to that have seen it had never heard of Firefly before a week ago, and they all agree that it is a fantastic movie. To me, it had all of the right ingredients that made me a fan of the series in the first place: action, humor, and most importantly, character development (something that movies nowadays seem to lack in abundance). The script is top notch, peppered with Joss Whedon's quirky trademark dialogue, and the acting is A+. Don't let the fact that there are no ""BIG NAME"" stars in this movie sway you - Serenity is a treat from start to finish, and has the potential to be the next Star Wars if given a chance."	5.0	An excellent movie in its own right	2005-10-06	3	2	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A51PZD573BTTH	"William N. Sargent ""Pemigewasset"""	"Serenity starts and ends & has some memorable moments along the way, but to quote fro the original show Firefly ""My days of not taking you seriously are definitely coming to a middle.""  Firefly had made a family out of a cast of characters that reached out & included viewers from just about the very first minute.  Family & loyalty were stressed throughout the too brief run of the series.  Now, in the movie there's a stilted, stiff feel to the crew's interaction & River & Simon are completely out in the cold; Mal specifically states at the beginning that River & Simon aren't part of the crew, directly contradicting his statement from the series that they are part of the crew.  The movie is a lot like my old Buick starting on a cold morning; balky, fitful & reluctant but it gets moving & keeps going, however grudgingly.  Along about the time things are humming right along (with a few scenes that are worthy of the telly programme, humour & wit & action mixing & gliding along in a disbelief suspending trance) Josh Whedon alienates fans with a startling event (no spoilers here!) which I have come to terms with but I know is a love it/hate it polarizing moment.  Curiously, I normally applaud a director & writer willing to take on this kind of challenge, but I guess this once the emotional investment I had was too strong to feel the usual bittersweet satisfaction of a job well done.  Unfortunately, while the story is good, the end stumbles as badly as the beginning.  The scene following the denouement has all the apparent forethought of a natural disaster.  It seems as though the end of the film came as suddenly upon the writer as it does the audience, and has a hastily-slapped-together feel.  In the final analysis, this was a project that had a lot to live up to & has the taint of 'milk-the-cash-while-we-can'.  One is uncertain whether there was a tragic attempt to reach that ideal result from the springboard of excellence, or whether it was a halfhearted jab at the money available from a rabidly loyal fan base (I'm a browncoat).  It's a middling entry into the action sci-fi category, no more or less memorable than most any other entry into the summer scamble.  This is worthy of purchase for fans, but if you're looking for a thrilling sci-fi adventure, check out Farscape, if you haven't already."	2.0	Serenity; Everything you always wanted in a movie based on a wonderful TV show, and less	2005-11-22	91	17	74
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2WFW48RXB26AR	William Parks	There's two types of people reading this review -Fireflyfans and non-Firefly fans.  If you aren't familiar with the show, this isn't for you.  And if you *are* familiar with the show, you probably don't need me to tell you whether or not to see Serenity.  That being the case, read on for my impressions.Quick history review: Joss Whedon, overall creator guy, enjoys cult success fromBuffyandAngel.  Of note is his practice to lay out the overall arc of the show several years in advance.  The first season of Firefly is made, shown half-assedly and out of order, and canceled, leaving lots of unanswered questions.  The DVD release of Firefly leads to it becoming a cult favorite in line with his other shows, and a movie deal was made.It's pretty obvious from the get-go that Serenity is here to (among other things) try and wrap up the show, tying up loose ends in both the present and past of Firefly's canon.  And it works on that front, if somewhat clumsily.  We see why some big things in Mal's universe are the way they are, and that's good.The visuals are pleasing, and avoid many of the modern sci-fi pitfalls.  Rarely if ever are we violently pulled from enjoying the movie by blue-screen bonanzas, and while the scope of the movie makes the ship feel less cozy than it did on the small screen, it beats the sharp CG-to-cheap-set transition of movies like Red Planet.The sound is booming and epic, which is actually sort of a problem.  The twangy guitars and soundless space scenes have been traded in for a big movie score and roaring thrusters.  While this effectively Hollywoodizes things, it takes away from the flavor of the property and eliminates one of the more enjoyable aspects of the show.At its heart, Serenity doesn't feel genuine.  It's a TV show dressing up as a movie, like a kid trying on his big brother's suit and looking faintly ridiculous.  The big movie parts are forced and somewhat hollow, and the little TV moments that haven't been discarded are stifled and overshadowed by the epic bits.  Think of the parts in Wayne's World on the paid set and you'll have a good idea of what I mean.The irony of the whole thing is that by trying to broaden the appeal of the characters and universe, Serenity has become an uninviting movie which will appeal only to those already in love with it.  It's good on those terms, but you won't walk away as blown away as you'll want to be.	4.0	Too Damn Big, Hero	2007-08-20	14	5	9

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	ASZEK2N0EYMXG	"Willy Boy ""Willy Boy"""	"Based on the incredible Amazon reviews I bought both the Firefly series (also 5 stars) and the Serenity movie.  I watched the movie first and then the series though it really doesn't matter in what order they are viewed.  As I stated in my comments for the Firefly Series DVD, I think the concept is great.  While it is a retread of the 'ole sci fi western (ala Star Wars), just because a story has been told before doesn't mean it isn't worth watching again.  The manner in which Mr. Whedon weaves his story is amazing and quite engaging.Having said that, I became very curious as to whether we have seen the last of Serenity/Firefly.  Here is where the bad news comes in.  In an interview of Mr. Whedon before the movie Serenity was resleased an insightful fan asked him if we would see more of this storyline after the movie (e.g., a reincarnation of the tv series, a mini-serieis or a sequal to the movie).  Mr. Whedon replied as follows ""Hard to say. The Movie has to be a hit before these questions become relevant.""I decided to do some research to see if the movie was a ""hit"".  According to rottentomateos.com:Serenity'sBox Office Total: $25,335,935Box Office Opening: $10,086,680No. of Weeks in Top 10: 2Highest Ranking: 2VHS RENTALS REVENUE SUMMARYVHS Rentals Total: $5,320,000VHS Rentals Opening: $1,640,000Highest Ranking: 25This was described as ""modest"" and ""not quite meeting the expectations of the producers"" by other web sites.Not giving up hope, I decided to see what type of numbers warrants a sequal.  I chose Underworld since the sequal to that movie is opening soon.  Now, if you have not seen the original Underworld, let me just say ... it sucks.  Other than a hot lead actress and some interesting visuals, the plot stank and the acting was subpar.  Unless you are a horny 13 year old male the movie does not warrant more than a half star.Having said that the movie did well enough to warrant a sequal: Underworld 2 Evolution.  So I checked on the numbers for Underworld to see if we had any hope of a Serenity sequal.  According to rottentomatoes.com (which gave the movie a ""ROTTEN"" grade):BOX OFFICE SUMMARYBox Office Total: $51,483,949Box Office Opening: $21,753,759No. of Weeks at #1: 1No. of Weeks in Top 10: 3VHS RENTALS REVENUE SUMMARYVHS Rentals Total: $3,600,000VHS Rentals Opening: $1,340,000No. of Weeks in Top 10: 3Highest Ranking: 5What can I add?  The numbers speak for themselves.  A sequal to Serenity which deserves more attention will probably never happen, while I am anticipating an Underworld 3, 4, and 5 ... at least.  As Clint Eastwood said in Unforgiven, ""Deserve ain't got nothing to do with it."""	5.0	Bad News For Fans !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2006-01-19	6	4	2

I highly recommend the series, but also think it really helps to have seen it before viewing this movie.That said, this intense film was more than just a 2-hour episode:  it truly granted the poor doomed Firefly series the big-screen treatment it deserved.  ""Serenity"" is full of action, humor, intensity, and character depth.  It's also got its share of surprise twists that will shock you and keep you on the edge of your seat.  At a certain point as Serenity builds to its finish, I became depressed, because I realized that writing this good was about to come to a complete and final end.The collector's edition is reasonably priced and contains many behind-the-scenes goodies as you'd usually expect in a two-disc DVD: bloopers, outtakes, and a few fun tidbits I'll leave for you to enjoy.Highly recommended, and what a pity the Firefly series was too cool to survive Hollywood."	5.0	Burn Hollywood Burn	2008-06-08	3	2	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1BQ318GESS864	Wired Wrong	The movie was great, and based on how it feels compared to the Firefly series it is great!! I had at first had hard feelings about watching a movie about a series that died after one season. But after watching this movie I found myself wanting to watch the series, and I got to say that if they turned the theme into a video game or made or extended the story of the show in some way it would be one of the greatest things I could think of and I would greatly enjoy any of it as long as it's executed well. Like many people I prefer wide screen formats, because all thou it makes the top of the screen smaller and the bottom it tends to give you more content on the left and right sides of the video feed.ROCK ON FIREFLY!!!!	5.0	Firefly how can you go wrong?	2009-12-02	3	2	1
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A38N7SFDOB3MR3	Wisconsin Dad	Before watching Serenity I had never heard of the Firefly universe. Halfway through the movie, I hit pause and logged on to Amazon to see if there was more...and there was. After seeing Serenity, I am now purchasing the whole Firefly series.Serenity is character driven sci-fi that is light (in a good way) on special effects, and heavy on story. A great aspect of the movie is that you never know what is going to happen next.The crew of Serenity is filled with real people, with flaws, but they are very lovable. There is a degree of bickering between the crew, but it is done is a very believable way. It comes off as the arguments you had as a child with your siblings: you disagreed, but at the end of the day you still cared for one another, and had each other's back.Something not often mentioned in these reviews is the fact that the show's cast is well put together. Not only do they work well together, but each has a very unique screen presence that only fortifies the story.My heart is saddened, as a new fan to the Firefly universe, that this is the end. This show should never have been cancelled.If you are a sci-fi fan, checking out Serenity is a must. But you have been warned: once you see the movie, be prepared to spend $50 on purchasing the Serenity and Firely series DVDs.Total Score (out of 100) = 8846 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

But the big budget feature film provided one last adventure that was truly exciting, and it was great to see all the old characters again. This movie can be watched as a stand-alone thrilling film with excellent pacing and editing. But I would highly recommend that you go back and watch the short tv series that expanded the characters with the format that the weekly show allowed - you will not be disappointed.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2LG4DAI9Z2YJJ	W. Perry	Serenity is my top movie for 2005, and I'll tell you why: the characters. It is based on, and in conclusion to, the prematurely cancelled (thank you Fox) TV show Firefly. If you have seen the show before, you probably already love the characters, if not, you will.Instead of being inexorably drawn by the tides of the universe, even though the main character at one point states that he simply follows the wind, this movie is drawn forward and driven by the characters. Their choices, their emotions, and their relationships are what guide this. Not technology, deus ex machinas, or even their desperate situation (which becomes increasingly so, as in any great sci fi flick).Yes, the action is great, though not on par with the Matrix as some commercials state for some reason. Yes, the special effects are spectacular, although obviously not created by ILM. And yes, the story and the big twist revelation at the end keep you guessing. But what makes this movie is the characters. Believable, fresh and compelling.	5.0	They aim to misbehave	2011-03-09	0	0	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1I4A7LUQEMAKM	"Wren ""Wren"""	First of all, the Firefly series, which this movie is based on, should have never ever been cancelled during it's first season. It is a series that should have enjoyed a long well-praised life on TV. The chemistry between the characters were superb and the main characters were wonderfully interesting and complex, especially the captain. I just had 100% faith that the series would have been renewed or picked up by another network. There was no doubt in my mind...that just how good the series is.Next, the movie was excellent, action-packed, and greatly lives up to the spirit of the TV series. You care about the characters and the action draws you in. I hate that the movie had come so soon. Although I loved the movie, I feel like I was robbed of all of the adventures and character development that should have occured through the life of a TV series. It's like watching Michael Jordan developing into a great basketball player during his Rookie season only to be immediately fast forwarded towards the end of his career where he is playing the last championship game of his career. You could only imagine how exiciting it would have been to watch him actually develop into such a great athlete.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A98YZLVOD6KVJ	XHandsofBlue	This is surprising considering the plot of Serenity is a gritty outlaw western, set in a science fiction genre.  But the reason why 4 out of 5 movie critics gives it a thumbs up ([...]) is the acting, cast chemistry, how much you as the audience come to care about the characters, even if you haven't seen them before, and the fact that it is a classic tale retold with twists that point out the glaring clich&eacute;s in other films and make you laugh.  My how you laugh.  And maybe cry too.Like I said, you find yourself pulling for the crew of the Serenity.  They are the underdogs.  The outcasts.  These are not the beautiful people.  These are the people you generally pass in the streets and hope to ignore.  These are the lower class trying to make a living on the frontier.  This is their story.  And like truth, they do not fare well.It is also a story about a fundamental reality, that there are two kinds of people in the universe: Those who wish to be left alone, and those who won't leave them alone.  And that those who won't leave them alone are almost always the winners.  That the world almost always belongs to those who wish to be left alone because they struggle to make the land livable, but their property is always taken by those who follow.Serenity, the movie is an struggling underdog too.  It  is a shame that like the crew of Serenity, this film isn't faring well.  It is playing to mostly empty theater seats.  And that is a shame, because it means you will miss your chance to see a good yarn.  That is a rare thing coming from Hollywood, as we experienced this summer with every tired, warmed over sequel, remake, and hack television drivel.  Yes, Serenity is based upon a failed TV series.  But it was not a hack plot.  It was a fresh perspective, that got a major motion picture studio to spend $40 million to bring the tale to the big screen.  If you want to see a good movie for once, you had best hurry, because sadly, even with the very good reviews, Serenity won't be around much longer.Would I say this is a must see?  No.  Would I say this was a B+ should see.  Absolutely.

The one bounty hunter with the sword still sends chills up and down my spine with the actors portrayal.	5.0	Great acting, story telling, sets...	2014-04-04	0	0	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1YEPFLLH42OU1	"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia"""	I at first didn't know that Serenity was based on a TV series. After renting and watching it, I promptly bought both it and the Firefly series. Yes, it's that good.The movie briefly recaps the most important aspects of the series' characters, and proceeds to a rather fantastic conclusion. The plot is unique, full of twists, and memorable. The characters are distinct and superbly acted- in my opinion, one of the best performances in sci-fi to date. You needn't have seen any of the series episodes to understand or appreciate the film, but watching them either before or after the movie does help. If you've seen the series, Serenity brings it to a pretty solid conclusion (there's a bit of room for continuation, but it does have the taste of a finale). If you haven't, this will likely convince you to do so (and you should, the series is also excellent). Visual effects are on par with current sci-fi films, and this looks like a movie theater quality production even though it wasn't shown at any to the best of my knowledge.The only regret I have about Serenity is that it was prematurely cut as a series. I'd never heard of Firefly before (and most everyone I've mentioned it to hasn't), so perhaps it was a result of bad marketing. Hopefully this movie will get someone to make more episodes of the series, since there's clearly a lot of leeway in terms of plot time between the first season finale and the movie. The universe Whedon created here is truly a feat of the imagination, and it would be a shame to leave it.	5.0	One of the better sci-fi films around	2007-01-22	5	5	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2L6DAMYIYGTL3	"Zachary C. Hill ""bobamillionaire"""	Pretty much all this collector's edition is a way to get Serenity another movie deal and that's it. The numbers for both the series and the previous version of the show were really high and with this new collector's edition coming out there has been some serious talk about a sequel to Serenity. So even if you already own the movie, but would like to see a second installment, buy a copy, or get one as a gift for your friends, cause this is the last shot this show will get.	5.0	Collector's Edition = Hope For a Sequel	2007-10-23	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A277TW0L7RX560	Zachary D. Bernstein	"TV shows that get canceled after one season don't get feature-length motion pictures made after them.  (Scratch that - they don't get ANY motion pictures made after them.)  So the fact that ""Serenity,"" the film spawned of Joss Whedon's lamentably short-lived ""Firefly,"" not only was made but apparently merited a ""Collector's Edition"" DVD due to sales of the original edition, is quite unbelievable.  But it's a testament to just how good the series and movie really are.Obviously, this is a must for any self-respecting Browncoat.  Two reasons why: First off, it's got the movie you love, plus a lot of special features thrown in.  Deleted scenes, a laugh-out-loud blooper reel, and some documentaries.  Some of these were in fact in the original DVD, but it's cool nonetheless.And secondly, if enough of you buy this, there might be a sequel.  There are rumors about it.But even if you're not a fan, you should try it out.  (Actually, get ""Firefly"" first and watch that.  The TV show is even better than the movie, and a lot of what happens in the movie doesn't mean as much if you haven't seen the show first.)"	5.0	Serenity flies again...again.	2007-11-04	2	2	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"While watching the ""Firefly"" TV series, I was only so-so about the show after the first couple episodes.  Then it started growing on me and by the end I was really drawn into the characters.  That is the same basic pattern, ironically enough, for this follow-up movie ""Serenity""...starting up slow but building momentum with every passing scene.For a basic plot summary, ""Serenity"" sees Mal (Nathan Fillion) and his crew ""still flying"".  The focus this time is on River Tam (Summer Glau), who is being pursued by an operative of the Alliance (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  Along the way, Mal & Co. have in a few rough scrapes, learn much more about the psychotic Revers, and ultimately make a decision that will define their overall mission.Half-way through ""Serenity"", I was thoroughly unimpressed and thinking a 2-star review would be in order.  The characters seemed different from where the TV show left off and I was having a difficult time meshing the two things together.  Of course, Joss Whedon was given a very difficult assignment here by having to introduce a new audience to already-established characters.  So, for more season ""Firefly"" viewers, the first hour seems a bit disjointed and strange.The last 45 minutes or so, though, are truly incredible and showcase everything that is good about the entire ""Firefly"" concept.  The characters come together and begin interacting as a team again, the humor is at the right pitch, and the gritty nature of the future is never more apparent.  What was very much a middling effort is turned into a great cinematic experience in the span of just under an hour.Though ""Firefly"" was never given a true send-off from FOX (instead being cancelled just when it seemed things were getting good), ""Serenity"" provides a very nice coda to such a well-written, well-imagined series.  The character ""re-development"" is a bit strange, but once things settle down this flick tells one of the better ""Firefly"" stories in the show's canon."	4.0	A Microcosm Of The Series Itself	2013-09-09	1	1	0

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A1F670GECCPOAC	Zak Mckracken	Serenity is an excellent sci-fi/action film, with great characters and very entertaining. I had seen part of the movie prior to watching the TV show (Firefly), but watched all of Firefly before I went back and watched the whole movie. It's a great film regardless, but I think the characters and their relationships mean much more if you've watched the TV show.I bought the DVDs of both Firefly and Serenity before I had a blu-ray player, and I will say the blu-ray is a noticeable step up in quality. This blu-ray is an excellent production, and I would recommend (and have recommended) this show to anybody who enjoys an action film that still has a good story and personable characters.	5.0	Fantastic movie	2012-03-11	1	1	0
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A39VA8UJ3SEJJK	Zen Flush	"This thing here is DEFINITELY very overrated. If you havent seen the film, don't read, many spoilers ahead.Ok, the goods:- Nice GFX, but then again so does every other sci-fi film.- some nice scare moments- the second part of the film was more interestingthe bads:- I think the lead actor is very weak. Worse than Keanu Reeves. I could not understand was he meant to be a comical dude or a rough one. He seemed all-over-the-place wacko non-leader type of guy. Maybe it was the bad acting.- The characters where all the same, had the same kind of humour etc. Even the only 'bad' guy - the black dude that turned good. They were the same!- bad dialogue. uninteresting. It really sounded like a tv episode.- BIGGEST gripe: Holes in the script. Unrealistical, not logical behaviors. Right from the beginning. Some examples:In the beginning when the captain is told that they could all die. He then says to the microphone that small turbulance and explosions ahead: WTH? Clearly this dialogue was put in for cinema viewers pleasures. Not logical behaviour. Or is he a kamikaze, am I missing something?In the end where there is the reavers hold-up at the gates where they put CRATES in front of them and in front the doors!? And then when they are out of ammo, and have lost men, some of them are hurt, then they back out behind some VERY solid steel doors and take a breath. WTH? Why didnt they start the hold up there?Reavers didnt seeme to possess ANY firepower. WTH? They have intergalactic spaceships, and fight with their CLAWS!? OK, they had darts!?Whats up with using bows in that same sequence anyways? Bows fly faster than machinegun fires? WTH!Also in the end where the black dude and captain are fighting. Fighting for what? That the disk would/wouldn't get displayed, right? So why couldnt the black guy just destroy the disk reader? You know the thing where he placed the disk and pressed the miracle ""Send All"" button. Like WTH??About the disk... left me thinking.. if they talked to that guy over satellite, the one who had hundreads of LCD's and a robot wife. Couldnt they just SEND the signal to him and he then would have broadcasted it. Ok, this is something you could say: ""you cant send holographic images via satellite"" but still strange.There where MANY more of these, but my memory is weak. Believe me I was like 'WTH?' most of the time.OKAll in all I would give it 2 stars This is what it truly should be. They put a lot of money into this, you could see, but writing ruined it. And better actors would have been nice.Scripting - ai ai ai!Ending on a more positive note: if you close your eyes on these points, are a simple person, or a pre-teen it would be a pretty awesome movie :)"	2.0	Zzzzzz...	2005-10-24	106	6	100
B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A2YMFNXSPRVKEW	Z. Fu	I do not see what the hype is about.  The story is unoriginal.  Characters are paper thin.  Action is underwhelming (the space battle sequence is less than 3 minutes).  Humor is ill attempted.

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ	Zoe Paris	I loved this movie in every way. I actually saw the movie before I ever saw the 'Firefly' shows. Even before I'd seen the shows I found the movie very easy to follow. It's basically about a crew on a ship, in space. They have a girl on board with inhuman powers who knows way more information than she should and this gets them into a LOT of trouble. It would be difficult to write a spoiler about this movie because it has a lot in it. It was an awesome movie with a lot of action, lots of good laughs, a fast pace, some scary parts, a good amout of violence but not too much and a wonderful plot with chilling undertones which unfold throughout the film. The suspense was good and the characters seemed very real. It even has a little romance too. It's a well balanced story. Might be a little too scary for young kids but fine for older ones. I really found it refreshing that this movie went back to the roots of action and adventure and focused on a great plot and great acting rather than tons of expensive special effects. Overall, I would say this is a great movie and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. I would love to see a sequel one day.	5.0	The best sci-fi action movie to come along in a while!	2006-11-16	6	6	0

This is the kind of stuff that I think most people love to watch and the bozos at fox decide to cancel the show. This movie managed to tie up some loose ends, have action packed scenes, change your emotions from happy to sad to angry and on the edge of your seat thrills. There was no foul language so I can take my younger relatives and friends. I'm definitely buying this one. I just have to congratulate Mr Whedon for his outstanding work on this movie and to ask whether the people at fox are in the right jobs?

B000BW7QWW	Serenity (Widescreen Edition)	A37BV7IC7QQUBT	"Zoot Zoot ""Zootie"""	"I already had Serenity on DVD before this Collector's Edition came out. I thought it was going to have added scenes to the original movie but sad to say I was wrong. If you already own the first Serenity DVD then don't bother with the Collector's Edtion. It does not have added scenes in the movie and the special features and interviews aren't enough to make up for the disappointment.If you don't own Serenity then buy this Collector's Edition. It's only a few bucks more and the special features are worth an extra 3 or 4 dollars.I hope that Joss Whedon comes out with a ""real"" collector's edition very soon that includes added scenes into the movie itself.I give this Collector's Edition 5 Stars for those who don't already own Serenity and 1 Star for those that do own the first Serenity DVD.

In fact, I did not TRULY get into the series until earlier this year, when Sci-Fi reaired the series in full.Soon after, though, I discovered that a movie was to be released.I saw this movie.And I was blown away.The essence of ""Firefly"" is captured in this film. This blend of action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, and Western doesn't lose anything from the series (well..it does, but to say what would be spoiling the film for those that haven't seen it).Wonderful CGI and camerawork. Same acting you're used to. Better character development on many of the characters you've come to love.I'm strapped in waiting for a possible sequel.See this film. Buy this film.
