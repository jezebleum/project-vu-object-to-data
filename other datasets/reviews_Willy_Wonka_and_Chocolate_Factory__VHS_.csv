Good performances, all right special effects and definitely not as creepy as the remake. In fact, it's not creepy at all and differs from the remake in a good way. I didn't love it, but it's a good movie, none the less.. and with some twist at the end.	3.0	Ok. movie.	2014-05-12	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1Y01AUJIB5JRE	Aamir Ansari	$43.99 for a Blu-ray DVD?! Even a movie as awesome as this does not deserve to be priced so high. I have nothing against the film, which is a classic if ever there  was one, but I do think Amazon needs to be a little more reasonable about pricing.	1.0	Surely ye jest!	2011-10-14	35	8	27
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2W5R3UTI60YDY	"abacus ""Get behind the MULE!!!"""	I received this as a birthday gift last year (42nd btw) from my mother.  She knew it was one of my all-time favorite childhood movies, so she got it.  I appreciated the thought and thanked her.  However, I thought this was a waste of her money because I'll probably never watch it.  Thank goodness I did and after I opened the package, I was amazed at all the extra information regarding the making of the film, the hand-written notes between Gene Wilder and the Director, some casting info, talks about every little detail imaginable.  This movie was a masterpiece IMHO and this package just raised my respect level a 1000 times more.  Oh yeah, the movie looks incredibly detailed in blu-ray with extremely rich colors.  Love it!  Big thumbs up!!!	5.0	Much more than just a blu-ray upgrade	2012-04-08	0	0	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1MKS8KSK36VES	"A. Berg ""A mom"""	This movie is far superior to the newer version, and I'm not just saying that out of a sense of nostalgia. Gene Wilder did a far more subtle job of portraying a very creepy figure. There are tons of references that are just waiting to be discovered, and subtle jokes that are very funny. None of this got translated into the bad job Depp did in the newer movie. The DVD is excellent, and the price is right.	5.0	Wonderful movie	2010-04-22	2	1	1
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A32JKNQ6BABMQ2	"abe ""starman"""	tim burton is considering doing a remake of this film.the flaws are a very long introduction process and the chocolate  guy  is very vague and mysterious.the chocolate guy is getting old and never had kids.he seeks to find a good decent kid to teach his secrets to.so,he has a worldwide search go out to find the winning wrappers on his candy bars.the winners would get a trip to the chocolate factory and get to meet the chocolate guy.but,they also would be given the oppurtunity to be the new owner when he retired.so for a very long time at the beginning the movie drags on and on to kids all over the world who are eating chocolate.not very exiting.late in the movie,they finaly get to go to the wonderland of sweets!eventualy a kid wins.whoopee!gene wilder is the chocolate tycoon.i think the only decent movie he was in was see no evil hear no evil and this one.the kids like the factory but not all the waiting .it is not very consistent with the book.however the tour of the magical chocolate factory was cool.	3.0	what a weirdo!	2004-09-10	24	1	23
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A7P90I2JMGPPV	Ace	"What a great movie, the kids loved it. However, I didn't see anything special about ""full screen special edition"" -- it looked the same as any other DVD on my HDTV and DVD player. I probably could have saved a couple of $$ on another version.Furthermore, the CD arrived with a cut through the UPC symbol. When I used to buy LP's, that was an indication that it was returned, or resold, or used or something like that. Was this not new then? Also due to that, when I peeled off the outside wrapper, the plastic case tore.The DVD was not damaged, so all in all, I decided not to return it."	3.0	Movie is great, DVD was not	2012-07-09	0	0	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1IJKK6Q1GTEAY	A Customer	I liked just about every thing in this movie except the freaky boat ride. I have this on video and try to watch it at last once a year so I won't overwatch it and get sick of it! Gene Wilder was great in this movie and was the perfect choice to play Willy Wonka! I highly recommend this movie which I personally like to watch either around Easter or Halloween when you have all that candy to eat.	5.0	Awesome Movie.	2002-01-03	0	0	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2ZKMFSEUP8UA8	A Customer	This is absolutely the BEST MOVIE of all time! It has an irrepressable dose of WHIMSEY, and a large dash of MAGIC! It is the quinessential &quot;Feel Good&quot; movie with morals! Veruca Salt...with her whining  &quot;I Want an OOMPA LOOMPA NOWWWww Daddy! &quot; How she always WANTED  immediate gratification, the true essence of SPOILED! She was a BAD EGG!  All the children represent all walks of life, and the self-centered things  which make for an Unhappy and unsuccessful life as an adult! The ending is  awesome, with the suspense teetering to the very end! A masterful film, and  Gene Wilder deserves an Academy award for his performance! I hold this film  near the top...with the Wizard of Oz! It has to be the best family film of  all time, and I wish they had it on DVD as I would buy several copies to  give to friends! Everyone should see this classic, and share this with  their families! It enriches the basic bonds which bind us all together!  Happy Viewing, and remember...&quot;Want to change the world..there's  nothing to it&quot;!	5.0	Best movie of &quot;ALL TIME&quot;	2000-06-13	4	1	3
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A18BD98SU49UB7	"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H."""	Gene Wilder is one of my favorite comedians. It seems to take so little effort to make us all laugh at his antics. He plays an excellent Wonka that has a walking cain even more deadlier than the Riddler's. At my age (a near firm 19) I get eye brows when I say I, yes, *Love* Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I have worn out several copies, and borrowed and rented it endlessly....so yes...I have a problem. But here is where the good news comes in. DVD. It's here! Join the wanka-visioned, wanka-tania, choco-licious fantasy and get Wanka As soon as you can. And though this edition is not wide-screen, those of you who do not care should enjoy it. 5 star's for the movie, the rest I am waiting on!	5.0	A pure imagination, Fizzy, and Lifting experience	2001-07-26	1	1	0

It is the product of a massive internet campaign to get this movie released in it's original aspect ratio.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a delicious and sinful movie about believing in yourself through a candy factory of course! Gene Wilder is a hoot as Wonka, his facial expressions are classic. This movie isn't perfect but I still feel this a good adaptation of the beloved book even though people like the newer version better.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1LRIU9ASZRAT5	Alan Jarvis	The image quality on this blu ray is superb.The vivid imagery really comes to life and the sound wraps around you superbly.You will not be dissapointed with the picture quality as you will pick out detail you have never seen before even if you have watched the dvd on an upconverting player many times as I have. I watch on a 2011 model 1080p plasma and this is one of the most eye popping movies I have watched.The collector extras are great fun too.A decent book with heavy glossy pages full of colour photos.Interesting reproduction letters.The movie extras are extended from the original dvd release. You actually get a very brief but insightful glimpse into Roald Dahl's life as a writer. Fun pencil case with pencils and eraser to put on a shelf or share with your little ones.This is a film my family watches a couple of times a year.We now have a renewed interest as we can catch nuances you just cannot see via dvd.I hope you and your family enjoy this movie on blu ray and the fun extras in the collectors edition just as much as I and my family do.	5.0	Choc full of fun	2012-02-12	1	1	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AJWMVSLEVJ1UP	Alan W. Petrucelli	We don't need Sammy Davis Jr. to remind us that it's dear old Willy Wonka who makes the world taste good. Based on Roald Dahl's gem, Willy Wonka is about a mysterious candy-maker (brilliantly played by Gene Wilder) who offers five lucky kiddies a chance to go behind the scenes at his hi-tech, high in calories candy factory...complete with milk chocolate waterfalls! A most tasty confection for the young...and young-at-heart. The 30th anniversary edition DVD has been lovingly restored, and contains many special features, including Pure Imagination: The Making of Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory, singalong songs and a behind-the-scenes featurette.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q	Allen Jackson	This review is for the blu-ray of WILLIE WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971, Gene Wilder version).A classic film, still fresh and pleasing to this day.  Kids and adults alike will enjoy it, and for the kids, repeatedly.One of the best-ever children's films, and for my money, it's far better than the weird and dark Johnny Depp version of recent vintage.The blu-ray picture is outstanding--for ANY era.  The flesh tones and all other colors are accurate and vivid, and frankly the DVD before it was amazing quality, too (when viewed on a tube TV).  But, the blu-ray is a significant upgrade when viewing both on an HD TV, and is even a bit better when comparing them on a tube TV, also.  The blu-ray's sound is excellent as well.Highly-recommended blu-ray on all fronts!	5.0	Beautiful blu-ray picture, classic film!	2013-10-26	2	2	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1XSW26YGZB1X6	Amazon Customer	I've always adored this flick, in large part because I think Gene Wilder did an outstanding job of bringing out Wonka's benevolent AND sinister sides in equal measure. There is most definitely a dark side to the Chocolate Factory, and Wonka doesn't exactly go to great lengths to conceal that from his bratty &quot;guests.&quot;Though it wasn't as much a part of Dahl's book, the TV coverage of the race to find the Golden Tickets is hilarious, too --it kind of foreshadows the obsessive side to which that medium has now reached with 24/7 news channels and reality programming.I think the most powerful moment in the movie, though, comes when Wonka dismisses Charlie and Grandpa Joe from the factory, with their prize null and void. Grandpa Joe is boiling with rage and is ready to take the Gobstopper to Slugworth right then and there, but Charlie stands by his promise and returns the Gobstopper. This whole Slugworth subplot wasn't really part of Dahl's book either, but it suddenly opens up the scope of the story and makes us see just what kind of generous soul Wonka really is. Wonderful stuff.I understand Tim Burton has acquired the rights to do a remake. No word yet on whether it will feature live actors or be more like the bizarre animation of &quot;James and the Giant Peach.&quot; Either way, I expect he will do the book justice.	4.0	Wonka's sinister side...	2003-07-23	2	1	1

This is about the worst timing, Im already into the movie, loving the HD picture, and then nothing further right when it gets to the most visually stunning part.  I was bummed, still am.  At least I bought it post HDDVD demise, so it only cost a couple dollars.  I put the HDDVD in the drive within 15 seconds of removing the shrinkwrap, so it is not fingerprints or anything on my part.  I use the xbox360 HD Drive with a 360.	2.0	HD-DVD Issue	2009-11-14	4	0	4

Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is very enjoyable to watch because it has a good story line, an enjoyable plot and a good ending.Through the whole movie you are kept guessing as to what is going to happen next and in suspense.The whole movie you enjoy the songs, and the dancing. The songs are very up beat and all of the characters get into them. it makes you what to sing and dance along. I know that I have.The person that you would think could never win gets the chocolate factory because they deserve to win the grand prize.The story was excellent and it kept my interest though the whole movie. There was a variety of personalities and it made you stop and think how some children really act.	5.0	The Passage Back to Childhood	2003-12-04	5	4	1

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Let&#8217;s try and forget for a minute that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton ruined this classic film and just relish in the fact that over forty years after its release, &#8216;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&#8217; is still as exciting, fun, refreshing, delightful and ultimately moving as it ever was!Adapted (loosely I heard) from Roald Dahl&#8217;s book, Mel Stuart&#8217;s revered children&#8217;s film is still one of my favorites, and it&#8217;s easy to see why.  While Dahl reportedly was unsatisfied with this rendering of his story, audiences agreed with Stuart and have propelled this to one of the all-time greats, a film that is remembered, quoted and beloved by many generations.  With a star performance by Gene Wilder (talk about an iconic role) and some of the most inspired production design of its time (or any, really), &#8216;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&#8217; is one for the ages.We all know the story, so I&#8217;m not going to rehash all that.If you haven&#8217;t seen this film, then waste no more time and snatch it up now (it&#8217;s a steal) and if you have seen it then you know why so many love it.  I was just pleased to be able to share this with my children, who rightfully preferred this to Depp&#8217;s 2005 mess.  Wilder will always be Wonka, and Stuart&#8217;s original will always be the classic we know it as because he got it 100% right!	5.0	Bask in the chocolate covered glory of greatness!	2014-03-05	2	2	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2WX1UESDOLXRE	"Ashley Quinn ""Ash"""	This movie is certainly a classic by today's standards, delivering us a world of color and candy. Kids are going to naturally love this film, with the fun musical numbers and funny little orange men called Oompa Loompas. Adults will appreciate Wonka's whacked out world, remembering the days when giant gummy bears and a chocolate river would be truly impressing to see.The movie centers around a boy named Charlie, who desperately wants to find one of Willy Wonka's five Golden Tickets so he can get inside the chocolate factory and absorb a bit of magic, laughter, and fun to get away from a world where he's living in poverty with his mother, his two grandfathers and two grandmothers. Of course Charlie does get the Golden Ticket and is whisked away to this magical factory where he takes a tour with four brats and their parents. The remainder of the film is a whirlwind of lickable wallpaper, giant candy bars, golden eggs, and scolding songs sung by the Oompa Loompas.While this is a good movie, it fails to dig into somewhat cynical side of the book written by Roald Dahl. The musical numbers make this movie sappy, campy, and a number of other words similar to those. The book will take you on a true journey, but the movie sputters along delivering the same message throughout the factory-- every kid is a spoiled, selfish brat-- except for Charlie.While many believe the 1971 version to be absolutely perfect, we'll see how well this version of the film stands up against the one to be released in the summer of 2005. Tim Burton (who will direct) promises to follow the book more closely, and he's already signed on the person to play Wonka-- Johnny Depp. Hopefully this pairing will bring something spectacular to the table and create a truly memorable version of this magnificent book.However, this movie, despite the fact that it's unlike the book, is still a movie you should you see, one that you will surely enjoy. While Wilder isn't exactly the way fans of the book pictured him, he certainly delivers as Wonka and brings life to the charactere. So check this one out sometime!	3.0	Fun and Imaginative, But Lacking	2004-03-07	5	1	4

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1B38S1YJR1PQD	A. S. Templeton	"This *widescreen* version is a scrumptious edition which corrects some editing flaws apparent in the cropped/fullscreen DVD one. Violet Beauregarde at one point does indeed have her finger up her nose during the boat journey down the chocolate river tunnel.Despite the dated styles in acting, clothes, and music, this musical's appeal has stood up very well (but, hey, look at the 1939 Wizard of Oz for *dated*!).After a recent reading of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, David Seltzer's rework of Dahl's source comes across as not so much an adaptation as an alternate version of the same story. It's tighter and has better dramatic flow than the book.The musical numbers by Bricusse, Newly and Scharf are engaging, not too frequent or cloying, and don't stall the plot. Not Arlen and Harberg, perhaps, but somewhat of a cut above the predominantly wretched pop music of the early 1970s.In an unacknowledged but probably necessary dramatic hiccup, Grandpa Joe sings the important song ""I've got a Golden Ticket"", which by rights should be rendered by Charlie. But as Peter Ostrum admittedly could not hold a tune (a serious casting flaw), Jack Albertson rises to the occasion and rasps it out just fine.I thinks it's very funny that ""Wonka"" was originally pitched to Quaker Oats by the movie's producers as a candy-bar-promotion gimmick to be shot on a shoestring budget. The irony is that the movie is so good but that the currently Nestle-produced Wonka-brand candy is so bad. But the movie rises above its base commercial roots and stands nicely on its own.Buy it & see it, while you wait for the remake...HOWEVER....It is most unfortunate that the only girl role models are such horrid brats!With the book, my 4 year old daughter kept asking about and referring back to Veruca Salt and Violet Beauregarde. But can one say anything positive about those ill-fated characters? At this critical time in her development, when she's looking to women and girls (real and in literature) as role models, the only girls in sight are punished and humiliated for their aggressiveness.I don't begrudge Charlie and his spiritual journey with Grandpa Joe, or his final reward. But there's little in the book or movie of redeeming value for young girls.The underlying message of the movie and the book is that girls have no part in larger adventures and rewards, that men and boys and male Oompa Loompas run the show. Mothers are either shrill, hysterical harpies or passive, feckless shadows."	4.0	A Classic perhaps, but take care with young girls...	2002-03-04	2	0	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	Our family had recently read the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Raold Dahl and wanted to see this classic film before Tim Burton's remake arrives. I hadn't seen the film for quite a while, and have to admit I was rather disappointed with the acting, sets and effects, which may have been astonishing in 1971 but which can no longer dazzle people who have seen Star Wars and The Matrix. To be honest, this film does not have much to offer unless you want to relive your fond memories of it. HOWEVER, I've given the film four stars, and base the bump up on the wonderful dvd extras, which include a commentary track with all five of the adults who played the Wonka kids -- this track is really fun to listen to. Also, a 30-minute featurette from 2001, Pure Imagination, includes interviews with director Mel Stuart, the 5 kids, Gene Wilder, an Oompa-Loopa and others, and it's difficult not to admire the pride and earnest love they have for the film. Other extras include photos, a trailer, an original 4-minute featurette and 4 sing-along songs. The film can be heard and subtitled in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese.	4.0	movie doesn't stand up but extras are great	2004-07-28	7	0	7

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1GLRZN5Y34PFW	A. Watson	I bought the widescreen dvd of this classic family film the other day for my 4-year-old daughter.  She loves the film and requests to see it over and over.  I still feel some of the warm feelings that I had inside me nearly 30 years ago, when the film first came out in the theaters and then later on commercial television.There are only 3 things that I find objectionable about this dvd:1. It is *edited*!  I recall back in the 1970s-version when Wonka and one of the parents are in the boat and are talking about a candy that allows one to spit in all of the colors of the rainbow, (I think) Violet says, &quot;spitting is such a dirty habit,&quot; while her finger is up her nose!  Then Wonka says, &quot;I can think of a worse one...&quot;  In this dvd, they cut out the picture of Violet with her finger up her nose.2. Grandpa Joe has a candy bar for Charlie... How did he get it being bed-ridden for over 20 years?  Then, when Charlie wins the 5th Golden Ticket, he gets out of bed and sings and dances.  Then, later in the film, he advises Charlie to give the gobstopper to Wonka's candy rival (Mr. Slugworth).  Grandpa Joe is a very dishonest and unlikable character for lying to the family about being bed-ridden and then wanting to cash out and get the money from Slugworth for the gobstopper when they get rebuffed by Wonka.  What an unethical grandpa!3. They take out Violet picking her nose, but they leave *in* the beheading of a chicken in that crazy tunnel that the boat travels through.  Unbelievable!  What were the editors thinking?Does anybody know if the widescreen laserdisc has the finger still in the nose?  If so, could you let us all know? -- I would buy that copy in a heart beat.	4.0	Classic Movie, but I have one bone (er, nose) to pick!	2002-02-10	26	13	13

For awhile there was only the standard and rather lame anniversary release of Willy Wonka on DVD and because of a ""limited"" release it became hard to find and expensive! So finally the brains at WB came to their collective senses to put out a new and much improved edition. The transfer and sound alone are a vast improvement over the original yet it still retains its 1971 ambiance by not over-digitizing unnecessary effects: ala Star Wars. Getting the wide screen version you discover what terrific photography a wide screen lens (if used properly) can do for children's cinema. Instead of getting obnoxious close ups we can get a full view of the terrific art direction which in this case is, well....pure imagination! The extras are simply great. A solid reunion documentary highlights the disc along with other goodies including the original featurette, sing along songs, original trailer and Wonka kids commentary. The doc. is a bit on the sappy side but it does shed some good light as to why, and how the movie was made. If any thing it's a trip to gander at the whole Wonka kid cast grown and hear them reminisce about filming. Although a person can't complain about the edition disc except that it is done too much for kids. Understandable but this ""children's"" film more than any other seemed to have a slight twist to the realm of adult. Especially given it's overt psychedelic moments and presumed dark demise of spoiled kids. Also it generally had ironic moments that played against it's own cutesy childish genre like Charlie Bucket (in the hurried and chaotic boat ride scene) suggesting that the film would make a great TV show. No where is this more evident than with Gene Wilder's on and off the brink performance as Willy Wonka. Arguably his best ever. His inspiring line ""So shines a good deed in a weary world."" can still make the cruelest most jaded heart in the toughest cell block feel like choking up. If you have a DVD collection and own ""Wizard of Oz"" it should be law that you have ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" as well. If not, that funny feeling you have is simply not being a complete person!"	5.0	Charlie's Golden DVD	2002-01-23	2	0	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	This 1971 classic is one of filmdom's best treasures. It continues to delight 30 years later. Gene Wilder stars as an eccentric candy man who sends out a few golden tickets in his Wonka bars. Whoever finds them gets to go for a tour in his chocolate factory. One of these kids is Charlie. A poor kid who wants nothing more than to go into the factory. He takes his Grandpa with him when he finds a golden ticket. Inside, the guests(all of whom are bratty kids)learn that Mr. Wonka is an unusual man with a very unusual factory. The film is full of one great masterful visual to another. Every scene is chalk full of eye candy(no pun intended). The film, unlike most other cherished family films, has a slight dark edge to it. When you think about it, it is kind of dark. Gene Wilder is a brilliant comedian. His hilarious one liners keep coming fast and quick. He is a master. Willy Wonka is a gem to treasure for decades and decades to come.	5.0	&quot;Is This Some Kind Of Funhouse Wonka?&quot;. &quot;Why?, Having Fun?&quot;.	2001-10-16	0	0	0

So while I prefer the new version I still like this version. I espically enjoy the song Pure Imagination.The reason why I prefer the remake of this movie rather then the old version is because the remake is more accurate then the old version. For example, in the old version Veruca begged for a golden goose while in the remake she begged for a squirrel just like in the book and among other stuff Violet turns into a big bluberry in the old movie, but in the remake, just like in the book, she turns into an extremley huge blueberry.In conclusion. I recomend the remake as it's more accurate.	3.0	Ok Movie	2005-11-24	6	1	5

Based on Roald Dahl's bestselling children's book (in fact, the screenplay was also written by Roald Dahl)  this marvellous tale about a poor little boy who finds one of Willy Wonka's  golden tickets and suddenly finds himself plunged into the most fantastic  thrill of his life will warm the cockles of even the coldest heart.  Not  since &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot; has a movie been so rich in fantasy,  imagery, and good old fashioned honesty and love.  You'll be rooting for  Charlie from the first moment of the film till the last!  This is a movie  that will be enjoyed immensely no matter how many times it is watched, and  it will be loved by both the young and the young at heart.	5.0	A golden ticket!	2000-06-28	4	4	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	Oh my goodness.  When I was younger BOY did I ever dream about being one of the lucky children in this movie.  Someone who was lucky enough to explore the most amazing, magical, chocolatey-flavored, tastiest, and craziest factory in the whole wide world, haha.Even to this day, when Halloween and Easter come around, I get chills down my spine when I see all these amazing, distinct and colorful candy varities sitting in a bowl looking so tasty and delicious, waiting for someone to come along and eat them.  Since this movie came out so many years ago, imagine how many NEW kinds of sweet candies have been created and released?You see, even though we eventually grow up into adulthood, that does not (and should not) EVER stop us from wanting to live the biggest dream of all- that being given the chance to fully explore Willy Wonka and his Chocolate Factory.  I will *never* grow up and stop thinking about all the sweet, tasty goodness that forces me to be greedy to have EVERY single bit of chocolate in the world, much like that one spoiled and immature little girl featured in the movie.And the chocolate river?  Are you kidding me?  I had many different phases in my life, and the one phase that continues to come back is getting the chance to swim down that river and drink my way to safety after several hours of fun.Imagine a world where everything is covered in chocolate or candy, such as what Willy Wonka's factory included, and that's where I would like to live every single day for the rest of my life.  The trees, the grass, the sky... *everything* so tasty you can eat it.Because of these recurring dreams, I have no choice but to declare Willy Wonky and the Chocolate Factory a classic film on the same level as the Wizard of Oz, and others.  Not just family entertainment, but storylines we never grow tired of, and frequently return to these movies over the course of our lives for the sole purpose of finding out if that dream we've had our whole lives is still there, and still going strong.  I can say with certainty that YES- that dream is still a part of my life.The ending to the film is perhaps the greatest moment ever because of the twist.  A little boys dream coming true.  One of the best movies ever.	5.0	a dream come true	2009-11-09	2	1	1

I can compare it to the book, though, and would say that personally I find the songs kind of annoying, but otherwise it is fairly faithful to the book.  I'm not a fan of musicals.  I don't recall anyone in the book breaking into song (except for the Oompa Loompas, whose songs I do like).  This is a fantasy that any child, or any adult who remembers being a child, will love.  Who wouldn't want to tour a factory like Wonka's?  It's also a cautionary tale, as all the kids represent a particular kind of kid (I'm sure we've all known a Veruca Salt, for example), and a particular vice.  There aren't any surprises.  You know Charlie is going to win out in the end.  But it's a hell of a toboggan ride!	5.0	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory	2005-07-19	2	2	0

I watched this as a kid growing up in the 70s and I never get tired of watching it 30 years later, bought it on DVD and again on Blu-Ray.  Gene Wilder gave no finer performance - earnest, offbeat, a brilliant portrayal which even the esteemed Johnny Depp couldn't touch (that may have been Burton's fault, who cares.)  The tale of dysfunctional children from all around world who travel to a magical chocolate factory to compete for a grand prize, only to drop off one by one while exposing their own character flaws - reality show technique 20 years before its time.  A great adaptation of the book which keeps the pace moving, provides a managable number of memorable characters, each played perfectly and with zeal.  Gene Wilder has some of the best one-liners in response to the often bratty children around him.  Sorry I haven't watched the Blu-Ray yet so I can't comment on the transfer quality, but I expect it will meet my expectations which are really just that it be better fidelity than the DVD.	5.0	A classic and one of my all time favorite films	2009-11-20	6	2	4

I was struck by the similarities between the two: The outlook of the factories, the layout of Charlie's home, the appearance of the children other than Charlie who got a golden ticket to visit the factory etc. Sure, we have a much different oompa loompa and much much different Willy Wonka. The songs are differernt too.Without a doubt, the special effects of Tim's film, shot some 30 years later, and aided by the latest technology are somewhat better. It would be easier nowadays to have squirrels without bothering about finding any subsititutes like the geese. Yes, the comical depictions of the 4 children may be more appealing to the younger audience who are well accustomed to cartoons. But to the more seasoned audience, the depictions here are more classical and Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka is magical: so much wit, so much warmth and charm that makes things so real...PS: It is also difficult to understand why Tim chose such an old and uninteresting man with such a dull face as THE oompa loompa. What is more, all oompa loompas were literally duplicates of him.  Such a boredom. I prefer the oompa loompas here and I enjoy their songs so much better.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1QDQT0ZAAZHQS	BookMania	This is one of the most beloved movies of all time, and a definite necessity for any movie lover's DVD library!  I've read the book by Roald Dahl on which this movie is based, and I have to admit that this is one of the rare occasions in which the movie is actually better than the book.  The movie is far more vivid than what my own imagination is capable of conjuring.This movie is the story of Charlie Bucket, a young well-intentioned boy who comes from a loving but destitute household.  He is one of five children who finds a Golden Ticket inside the wrapper of a Wonka Bar and earns a trip to Willa Wonka's chocolate factory.  The other four children include a glutton, a spoiled brat, a lazy boy who does nothing but watch TV all day, and a girl who incessantly chews gum.  These children and their relatives are taken inside the factory where they are singled out one at a time for their flaws and eliminated from the tour.The real star of the movie is Willa Wonka, who is engeniously played by Gene Wilder.  I don't know if he was ever nominated for an Academy Award for this performance, but he sure deserved to be.  His character is both psychotic and brilliant at the same time.  I've seen this movie many times, but I never tire of Wilder's acting ability.Overall, the plot is not as important as the way in which it is presented.  The viewer will be taken to a wonderous place with chocolate waterfalls and edible flowers and cute Oompa Loompas.  Your senses will be overloaded with colorful things to see and catchy songs to hear.  I don't know what Heaven is like, but I doubt it's much better than Willa Wonka's chocolate factory.  This is a tremendous movie and it deserves to be watched over and over again.  You NEED to buy this DVD!	5.0	You Must Own This DVD!	2003-01-05	8	6	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1YB29BIDULEYE	"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch"""	Starting with the nice things about this movie, it is a nice story of hope. Charlie is a nice boy (10-12) who has the burden of working after school to bring in some money so to assist his mostly bed ridden family. He loves his mother and both sets of grandparents. But he seems to have a special attachment to his grandfather Joe. Soon afterwards, Charlie and others learn of the Wonka contest where 5 lucky winners will receive a lifetime supply of chocolate and a tour of the Wonka factory. Naturally, people start buying as many Wonka bars as they can, but seeing that Charlie's family is poor, he is limited to just one now and then. One nice scene is that Charlie is so happy to receive just a scarf and a bar of chocolate for his birthday. (We could probably all learn from this.)Gradually 4 of the 5 tickets are found, and beating the odds, Charlie finds the last. The scene where he inspires his bed ridden grandfather to get out of bed is especially beautiful. The 5 winners meet at the Wonka factory. Gene Wilder wanted his character to be somewhat ambiguous. (Is he truthful or not?) And here is when the sinister elements of the movie kick in. During the tour of the factory, the 4 other winners (Augustus), (Violet), (Veruca), and (Mike) disappear into traps. We don't even see them come out on screen. Even if we argue that Wonka somehow knows they will be alright, he seems to take delight in their disappearance.Even Charlie has a near mishap, and if Wonka had been a bit more altruistic, he may have gone back to the room, and told Charlie and oe how to avoid getting hurt. (Of course Charlie and Joe find a safe way out, but it does make us wonder a bit.)Possibly, the darkest side of Wonka is when he tests Charlie by pretending to deny Charlie the lifetime supply of promised chocolate. He apologizes to be sure, but it does seem that Wonka enjoys playing God. (Though Wilder does bring a gentle side to Wonka as well.)Against the odds, I'm going to give this movie 3 stars for its redeeming elements, and suggest that parents reading this screen it before they give it to children.	3.0	Elements Both Redeeming and Sinister	2006-07-08	1	0	1
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AR8Y6VPVUHCSB	"Brad Torgersen ""Full-time nerd, part-time sol..."	"I first saw this as a child during an ""afternoon movie"" event at my gradeschool.  Little did I understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting, nor did I appreciate the subtle moral of the film, namely that good guys sometimes do finish first, by the very nature of their untainted goodness.Oh, sure, I rooted for Charlie and his uncle, the poorest of the poor, simply trying to make ends meet.  And who didn't despise Veruca Salt, the bratty English tart--with a pushover for a father--who acted like the world was her private oyster?But having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter, I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is, even in our age of CG film wizardry.  And without having seen the new version, I can't help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon, Willy Wonka.More impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward, old-fashioned morality tales with universal appeal.  Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film, including gluttony, vanity, greed, and avarice; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike.The lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated, and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film, or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?I'll have to check it out.  Meanwhile, see the classic, and be charmed all over again!"	4.0	When old-fashioned lessons came in sweet packages!	2006-08-01	4	2	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3SJ2VSCHZB18	Brian Markowski	"I remember when this film first came out, parents hated it.  They thought it was too dark and scary for children. The movie cost 3 million to make and was, in the end, able to squeak out only 4 million domestic. Not bad, but not great. In fact it could have easily been forgotten had it not been for the popular book, written by Roald Dahl, and a rabid fan base.""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", based on the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is the story of a famous but eccentric candy maker, Willy Wonka. Wonka works in obscurity, no one has ever seen inside his factory, in fact, no one has ever really seen Wonka. The movie starts with Wonka announcing that he will open up his factory, but only to 5 lucky people...the ones who find 5 golden tickets hidden in his chocolate bars. In the end 5 children find the tickets, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the annoying Violet Beauregard, the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the obsessed Mike Teavee, and the salt of the earth Charlie Bucket. The second half of the film is a tour through the mad but fascinating chocolate factory where Wonka's guests quickly start to disappear one by one.The extras on this set are illuminating a 20-minute or so documentary explores Gene Wilder's (Willy Wonka) motivation and offers up fascinating facts like Quaker Oats being the major funding for this movie. In fact Quaker Oats was hoping to market Wonka Bars in tandem with the movies release but the bars could not maintain their shape on store shelves and quickly melted into obscurity. The commentary is one of those ""You Must Listen To"" features if you're a fan of the film. All the children, now in their 40's, share memories and swap stories from thirty years ago on set. We learn what that chocolate river was really made of, who had crushes on who, and that, at times, all the kids really thought Gene Wilder was insane.Today the movie is still quite dark, but with its quirky and fun soundtrack, it's almost innocent looking sets, and strong moral message few would argue that this movie is not appropriate for even the youngest of children. I would say four and up should appreciate it, though the boat scene still freaks me out. It is a wonderful family film that holds up to repeated viewings for this generation and generations to come."	5.0	A Kids Classic that isn't Disney	2005-06-28	5	4	1

My favorite scene is the ride on the ""Wonkatania"" and his monolog about the ""Danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing"" gets my blood going whenever I think about it. That's another scene that my daughter leaves the room for.Excellent movie with good morals. It tells the story, not so much of a chocolate factory and Willie Wonka, but how excess can destroy people.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3DWUM6SN3N3NR	Brian Wallace (Co-author of It's Not Your Hair)	The world is full of losers like stodgy ole Lenny...Willy Wonka is absolute brilliance: an infinitely enjoyable and multilayered work of cinematic genius to be treasured like nothing else. My nephews and I have watched this film so many times and I still find little gems; there are nuances and surprises that happen the 10th, or 100th, time you have seen the film.Gene Wilder's immaculate performance is arguably the best of the last 50 years.The movie ages like a fine wine and provides edification at many levels. Unlike so many other so-called `kid' movies, this one actually offers much to people of various ages. Willy Wonka is actually the perfect combination: Anything naughty about it effectively passes over the heads of kids; and the proverbial `childish' stuff is entertaining enough to satisfy adults. Like Alice in Wonderland, Wonka even throws in some delectable psychedelia for good measure. Fun for the whole family.

The interviews were all done 15 years ago. And the voice over from the cast is the same that is on the DVD version that I own  now I own two copies because this came with a DVD as well).

What kid wouldn't like this?For a flick that came out 30 years ago it still holds up well. It has been restored and looks awsome. Buy this flick for your kids, if they aren't into &quot;Pokemon&quot; you can tell you have a Smart kid and he or she will enjoy this movie.	4.0	They Don't Make Kids Movies Like This Anymore	2001-12-19	3	2	1

The movie really picks up once you get past the awkward pre-Chocolate Factory musical sequences, such as the ""candy man"" scene where he kisses kids and pats their asses. Once you get inside that factory it's a mind trip from then on. Pay attention to Wonka/Wilder. He says the perfect lines with the perfect tone with the perfect whip of his cane.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2098U4WUN1GHZ	bubba joe	They just don't make movies this bizarre for kids (or anyone else) anymore. It manages to be cute and scary at the same time; charming and yet condemnatory. And Gene Wilder is tops.I think this film is probably appreciated today because it posesses qualities rarely found in pop culture anymore. It presents unapologetic black comedy, yet it honestly believes in its good parts. It skewers the upper and middle social classes (when was the last time a movie depicted wealth or television as a bad thing?). And, most of all, it presents a moral without candy coating it, or making you feel that it was put there just to win favor with consevative groups.People seem to get all hung up about how grim this movie is. Funny thing is, from what's showing in theaters nowadays, they're obviously willing to accept far grosser or more violent content in the name of comedy or cheap thrills, but when you do it to make a point, they get all uptight.Hate to say it, but I think another possible reason for this movie's continued popularity is that it appeals to some people's sadistic side (just look at which parts of the story they chose to depict on the cover of the latest release).	4.0	There's no earthly way of knowing...	2001-08-21	9	8	1

But those calling this a ""horror"" film are way off-base.I saw this as a child, and I don't recall being scarred for life.  And as a child, the beginning seemed to drag on FOREVER.  However, now as an adult, I can appreciate the set-up.Lots of cynnical humor for the adults, and lots of eye candy for the kids.As for the 2005 version:  I would give it a B-, while to me this version gets a B+."	4.0	great movie....	2002-11-25	1	0	1

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2P1C75HUR3P3X	Catherine G. Hamilton	"I grew up watching ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", dazzled by the wondrous characters, brilliant songs and Roald Dahl's unbeatable tale. But looking back on it now I am able to discern more about it than its pure enjoyment. As an adult, I see that the film is probably one of the most moving and moral stories that you could show to your children.I am consistently moved throughout by Charlie's story, one of humility, modesty, innocence and above all, hope. Comparing him to the other ghastly kids makes his qualities all the more apparent. The way that the film emphasizes the desirability of winning a ""Golden Ticket"" appeals to the child in all of us, most poignantly, I think, portrayed by the fact that Grandpa Joe finds meaning in life when restored by youth and excitement. In this film, winning a Golden Ticket becomes a matter of such urgency that it is pure Roald Dahl legacy, remembering his devotion to seeing life through the eyes of a child. This is brought out especially by the song lyrics - pure joy.Seeing the latest Johnny Depp version made me appreciate just what it was about the original that shines. The ""Slugworth"" storyline and the wonderful performance of Gene Wilder will always elevate it above the newer attempt because of its stronger sense of morality. Charlie, untainted by greed or selfishness due to his ""simple"" lifestyle, is a lesson to all of us, and receives the gifts of happiness and abundance he deserves.This movie may come over as amateurish (indeed, it shows its age in this respect) but it is one of the last tributes to a time when films focused inward rather than being overly concerned about special effects or ""humorous"" diversions (see the 2005 version). And the songs are seriously underrated, being some of the most melodic and fitting ever penned for a film musical."	5.0	Do your children a favor and show them this	2006-03-01	4	3	1

I never read the books it was based on. It's exactly as I remember it. I like the dark humor that exists in the movie. The music has some standout performances. The production quality is actually still quite good compared to certain movies today. So why the 3 star rating? Because I am rating the product as a whole.I gave it three stars for the quality of the product. I prefer widescreen over fullscreen so I can see the director's vision of the movie! The WIDESCREEN DVD is not correct at all. It is the full screen version with bars on the top and bottom! Not only are you NOT GETTING the UNSEEN FOOTAGE on the left and right, but you are also LOSING the top and bottom footage! Scandalous! It is an outright problem that needs to be remedied.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2O39VY1UEDCKH	Charles Jannuzi	This is the best version of the Dahl story on film, much superior to the Johnny Depp effort. It just goes to show if you have a good screenplay and some inspired acting, you can still beat CGI. This film actually has very good effects for the era in which it was produced, including imaginative use of video technology. However, it's the sets, costumes and songs that really make it stand out as a children's musical. About the only aspect of the new version (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, directed by Tim Burton) that is better is a couple of Danny Elfman's songs matched to the 'dispatch' of some of the naughty children. Gene Wilder might not have played Willy Wonka the way Roald Dahl envisioned, but if Johnny Depp did, I can only say Dahl's Wonka is a bit of a bore. Wilder really knew how to engage children with his characterization of Willy Wonka.I saw this film as a child in the theatre, and then got to watch it a lot on TV in the US as part of 'holiday programming'. It, along with 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', was always my favorite children's film. Critical reaction at the time was mixed, with many American critics not knowing what to make of this mostly British film with a mostly American cast. However for me as a child the film was a revelation. It showed to me that a live action film could be every bit as entertaining and fantastic as animation or the children's books (fantasy and science fiction) that I liked to read.	5.0	Just goes to show you don't need CGI, just good acting and a good script	2010-01-20	3	2	1

One can not help but feel anxious as Willy Wonka guides us through the inner workings of his factory.Adults and children alike will enjoy the lessons one learns from not listening, being selfish, greedy and not respecting others through this timeless classic.I highly reccommend it to anyone both young and old.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3N95R1VKWROWF	Christopher Schwinger	"There are a number of things that could be focused on in a movie review, but I will focus on the story structure and creativity, since I doubt many have in their reviews of this movie.  It is likely that you already know the story is about 5 kids who get to tour a chocolate factory, but only one has the good character to make it through to the end of the tour.  I hadn't seen the movie for some years, and when I just rewatched it, was very impressed with the imagination of the chocolate factory.  I do not know the book, but I am sure that some praise for the movie's imagination should go to Harper Goff, the art director.  Harper Goff also designed Captain Nemo's ship on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and was one of the primary designers of Disneyland.  (Wikipedia says he met Walt Disney in a London model-making shop, when he and Disney both wanted the same model train.)  In addition, I have always been impressed with the battlefield set on Sergeant York, and it turns out Harper Goff was the set designer for that, too!Besides the chocolate factory's breathtaking beauty designed by Goff, I also love the many imaginative ideas and surprises throughout the factory.  Concerning the story, I found it to be nicely structured, and pleasantly predictable AND unpredictable.  Charlie finding a ticket is something you anticipate will happen, but don't know how.  Later, after the first kid gets eliminated from the tour due to gluttony, you anticipate that a different vice will mess up each remaining contestant except for Charlie.  Yet the story moves in a compelling direction toward higher values than just ""Don't overeat, be polite, don't be greedy, don't watch TV too much"", to honesty and the Golden Rule.  It reminds me of the difference between the Old and New Testament in the Bible, a list of rules and regulations vs. the simple Golden Rule, to treat others as you would want to be treated.  I like it that the Willy Wonka movie moves in that direction.  Everyone else fails because they're self-centered, except Charlie.  Their vices are outgrowths of selfishness.In conclusion, while I find some elements/devices within the story to be illogical or out of place, and sometimes puzzle over Wonka's mannerisms, I find the movie rewarding for its imagination and for moving the theme in a morally progressive direction.  The unpredictability of Wonka is a major source of tension in the story, and its sudden resolution at the end is quite rewarding.  Gene Wilder's performance, for the most part, was quite amusing to me, and he is quite good at wry humor, at combining serious and comedic characteristics into the same role.  And the Oompa Loompa song (I think they're supposed to look like carrots to make you want to eat vegetables) is truly unforgettable, whether you like the movie or not!  I can see why this movie has been watched by as many kids as The Wizard of Oz.  The dazzling colors and feeling of wonder at seeing the candy forest/chocolate river for the first time are so much like The Wizard of Oz.  Not everyone would find the Wonka character appealing, and I didn't until I saw it just a few days ago and understood the ending much better.  But at the very least, this has delightful food for the imagination."	5.0	Impressive creativity/imagination!!!  (Thank Harper Goff, as well as author Roald Dahl.)

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2N84VEBTQFDSU	"C.J. Roger ""C.J. Roger"""	A true classic and brilliant movie. This movie was made before I was even born and even to this day it holds up the test of time very well. It makes you wish that we had more movies like this now a days for kids and people of all ages to enjoy.The story is of a very poor little boy named Charlie who doesn't have much, doesn't want much and helps out the family that all live in a one room shack.  When news spreads of the chance to win a tour into the famous Willy Wonka chocolate factory, pandemonium ensues and everyone starts to buy his chocolate bars to hopefully find one of the 5 golden tickets hidden inside for a chance to tour the famous factory that has been closed for years to the public. Charlie wants nothing more then to win a ticket and when he does, that's when the magic starts.The wonderful part of the movie is the factory itself that we finally get to see after a very long , yet enjoyable build up of all the kids around the world who find the 4 tickets before Charlie and how much you start to really root for Charlie as we find out more about his sad life.  When we get to the factory itself we see who is behind the chocolate, all the inventions that he has come up with and all the trouble the kids get into and what happens due to their actions. It really is a very psychological story that will not only make you think but laugh at the same time when you realize what happens to some of the kids and their parents.I can't stress enough how great this movie truly is. It has songs and colorful sets and great special effects. The actors who are all no names except for Wilder himself all play their parts excellently.  Its almost like the Harry Potter of the 70s in a way.  If anything this movie will make you think and laugh and its a movie you truly will want to watch many times. The DVD doesn't have many special features but it has the commentary from the actual 5 kids who were in this movie, even if they are 20 years older now and some sing along songs and trailers.  Also any age will like this movie. The kids will like the humor while the adults will just like the songs and well written story.If you ever wanted to see a kid go from rags to riches and have all his dreams come true when all seemed lost.. this is the movie for you. Even if you didn't this is still the movie for you. Get it now. You won't be disappointed at the fun and hi jinx that unfold through the eyes of one poor kid and a wacky chocolate maker.	5.0	An awesome movie that you will  make you a chocolate lover	2003-08-22	4	3	1

I looked forward to the annual event because my parents and I would watch it, and I just loved the story and the experience.The DVD allows for this experience to be at your leisure, rather than at the networks pleasure, now.  And the DVD quality is superb!The story of Wonka is not a complicated tale, but the set designs and the characters make this movie a wonderful experience.  Wilder is a strangely-workable mix of charm, blunt honestly, and plays the perfect grown-up kid.  The children are also perfect represenations of parenting pitfalls, albeit exagerated .(I want an Ompa-loompa NOWWWWWWWWWWW!)  Even the parental characters are dead on representations of every nightmarish trait (disinterested, over-indulgent, etc.)  It's a great movie to illlustrate the spoils of spoiling and the rewards of trying to just be a good person.The extras are great, and I personally loved the commentary on this one...added a nice dimension to a film I'd seen hundreds of times before.All in all, a terrific addition to your DVD collection.	4.0	Family-friendly film	2003-01-15	6	4	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7	C. L. Messina	There are a few things that have to be set aside to understand why anyone would love this film. Or should II say, it does have a few flaws that an adult, even one nostalgic for it, must concede.1. The Oompa-Loompas are not cute or sweet. Not that they should be, but their presence, while interesting is somewhat disturbing. Aside from being the most loyal factory workers Stalin could only dream of, what are they like? We never actually get to know them much more than a group of short men who celebrate each child's exit with song and dance. They present more questions than answers, which might be a good thing, but can disturb.2. The boat ride is needlessly shocking with no explanation for it's inclusion and no seeming reconsideration by the characters in the film. I guess they were too inundated with the onslaught of 'little surprises around every corner'.3. We don't really know exactly what becomes of the children who are ousted. Did they win the lifetime of candy or was WW serious about the contract?4. WW doesn't just make fantastic candy, he breaks the laws of physics with levitating bubbles and a teleporter (wonka-vision). Some magic is necessary, but this?5. The bad kids, aside from Veruca, are after all still children. Is gum chewing THAT bad? What about Augustus's eating problem? Some people have genetic disorders. And if the kid wants to eat, so what? I'm not saying these are model kids but they're not 'garbage' or 'nasty' as WW says.6. WW is sometimes unbearably rude even from the start. He insists his authority not be questioned or else. The way he grabs Veruca's face when she questions his 'Snozberry' remark is pretty crude and somewhat abusive.7. Grandpa Joe's incapacitation... That is until he gets a trip to a factory. Seems the elder's in the Charlie Bucket family could, say... Try. I do sympathize with Charlie and his Mother.So, there's the bad. I can admit to it. Now here's the good, or at least some explanations.Explanations first, or at least the way I understand it.1. The invention room is a ruse. Wonka KNOWS these kids will tell everyone they know everything they can and then some. He doesn't keep his most prized ideas in plain sight, he just wants the kids to have something insane and unbelievable to share when they get home. That way if they do see something important, listeners will dismiss it as nonesense.2. The boat ride is a slight ruse, but more like a Gargoyle to would be snoops. 'Don't go in Wonka's factory looking for secrets... There are passages where they cut off chicken heads!!!'3. Wonka always knew where the bars were hidden, that's how he could get 'Slugworth' nearby so quickly. Perhaps even the Candyman was an insider. 'Try a regular Wonka bar'.4.Wonka tried to help Charlie win. Did anyone notice he didn't offer Charlie a gobstopper until Grandpa Joe asked him for one?Reasons to likePerhaps I'm nostalgic, perhaps I just like to root for the underdog. On the surface this is an underdog story, but underneath it's about magic, surprises and youthful imagination. Wonka is a mad man- genious or hatter is up to the viewer. He's a mystery but one can't argue with his results. The movie is also very quotable. 'We are the music makers... And we are the dreamers of dreams.'  'Good morning... Look at the Sun!' I don't know, but seeing Charlie dance around with his granfather with joy and renewed hope just inspires me. It's a little corny but at the same time it's something you never see these days because it's not 'slick' or 'cool'. And that's a big part of what I like about the film. The setting, outside the factory is a time gone by. It was filmed in Munich, 1970 and it just seems like a storybook kind of land populated with storybook people. If these kids in the story are the worst of the lot then that must be heaven compared with today. Oh, and Veruca. What a name. Her fit/tantrum cracks me up every time. Who hasn't had a kid have an inexplicable meltdown? But that's how kids are- no need to send them to the furnace. And lastly, Charlie. He is about as sweet as they get. Wonka picked the right kid. And that ending line? Brilliant.It's not the glossiest, logical or even perfect film but it is endearing, mysterious, philisophical and disturbing all at once. That's quite a feat for any movie.Anyway, I love the film. I'm sure many others will continue to do so.	5.0	Hope this helps	2013-03-29	0	0	0

Interviews with the Wonka Kids, The director, screenwriter, producers, and even vintage footage of behind the scenes material. There's even a segment where the music people are playing and singing at a piano, testing the songs out. I haven't listened to the commentary yet by the 5 Wonka kids, but I'm sure it's informative and a blast to listen to. Besides the features on the discs, we also get a making of booklet, several pages of Wonka production correspondence in a nice envelope, and a retro style tin case holding pencils and an eraser. The pencils are scratch-n-sniff, and the eraser smells somewhat like chocolate. Since they are collectable items, I will never actually use them, of course. The whole package is nice, inside a wonder foil case that is limited. I got 68,400 of 100,000. Overall, if you like the movie, and are a hardcore collector of film like I am, I recommend you getting this 3 disc collector's edition. If you don't want all the extra stuff, then at least get the stand alone Blu-Ray. Quality is ""scrumdidlylicious""!"	5.0	Very good purchase	2013-10-08	2	2	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2AIB0TNI1FO5T	Condie	As a rule I don't care for the matted widescreen formating and will not get it if a true letterbox edition is available. The matted gets the whole picture in there but it usually appears a bit contorted. In this one the contortion was not too bad and it was certainly better in this case than the fullscreen formating that cuts off at least one third of the picture. All in all, the picture is very enjoyable.I also particularly enjoyed the 35 minute 'Pure Imagination' commentaries about the filming of this production.	4.0	Matted Widescreen Okay	2010-09-13	1	1	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AUCISQA1YXX86	Confederate	"This is a wonderful movie, BUT....It's confirmed. For some reason this release has seen a lot of problems in Blu-Ray. I've so far had three disks that have failed, after working perfectly once or twice. It's the only Blu-Ray disk I've ever have any problems with, but I've heard of other people with similar issues. The transfer also was a bit disappointing in that there was little difference between the Blu-Ray release and the upconverted DVD, which I'm now using.At first I thought my Blu-Ray issue was just with my system; but then I tried playing other Blu-Ray disks -- even TERMINATOR T2, which is known to be problematic for some drives -- and they all played without a hitch. I carefully inspected the disc for any signs of smudges, warping or cracking and none was found, so why the Willy Wonka Blu-Rays have a high failure rate I don't know. I've inspected all the ones I've had that have failed and there's not one iota of visible problems with the disks.As for the movie itself, many have asked if it's a kid's movie. I don't think it is. One movie reviewer even praised the film, but added that it had a ""mean streak"" that may make it unsuitable for some. He missed the point that the film itself is more a view of children through the eyes of adults. All of the children, except Charley, are rotten vermicious knids (look it up). They're pushy, arrogant, demanding and they have disgusting habits like overeating and picking their noses. I think it's a great children's movie, especially since it tells children what many adults think of them and their overbearing and over-lenient parents. (If you buy your kid a car when he or she is 18, then look in the mirror!)The Blu-Ray transfer is disappointing probably in that it's a 70s musical, but the DVD is rich in color and had decent resolution when upconverted. If you have high definition TV, I'd go for the upconverted DVD because of the failure rate of the Blu-Rays, but if yours works, don't expect the hair-popping sharpness and clarity of other Blu-Ray productions."	1.0	Wonderful Musical for Adults About Children	2010-05-19	16	10	6

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"When I first saw this movie on VHS in the late '80s, I was shocked. A '70s movie with a GOOD message?? I couldn't believe it. The message: kids - be honest and be trustworthy and don't be obnoxious; parents - don't spoil your kids or they'll quickly turn out to be brats.Wow, no wonder liberal film critics like Leonard Maltin trashed this film. It was not the normal message being delivered in movies, which usually mocks the good and glorifies the bad. That's what makes this story refreshing, and the same goes for the re-make that was released in 2005.Peter Ostrum plays the likable Charlie and is very good. He's one of the nicest kids ever put on screen and was a fine actor. It's kind of surprising this was the only film he ever did! Jack Albertson does a nice job of Charlie's loving grandpa and so do the bratty kids, especially the English girl who is so bad you have to laugh at her. (By the way, check out the bonus features and see what these kids look like as adults!)Gene Wilder is excellent as Willy Wonka.  Yes, that character has a bit of a mean streak to him but his comments are fun to hear and on the money despite his lack of verbal tact. Most people prefer Wilder's version of ""Wonka,"" by the way, over the bizarre-but- talented Johnny Depp's.This was an entertaining film that should keep your interest. It's also an interesting comparison to the 2005 movie. Frankly, I enjoyed both."	4.0	In Which Goodness Prevails	2009-06-09	0	0	0

And then he jumps into the gate to see people and he says can you come up here and I'll show you guys all of the candy?

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AYTTBFL34EVAD	"D. Allen ""meeko_2003"""	"While it has been proclaimed as a family classic along side of ""The Wizard of OZ"" and ""Mary Poppins"", I just cannot see what all the fuss over the film is all about. Perhaps it is because I never saw the film growing up or perhaps it's just that the theme does not seem appealing. Whatever the reason, I just don't get it. The film centers around a poor boy named Charlie who wins a chance to enter the doors of the Wonka Chocolate Factory, guided by the extremely secretive ""candy man"" Willy Wonka himself. He along with almost half a dozen bratty children and their parents enter the factory finding a strange and bizarre world where candy grows on trees and singing and dancing little creatures named ""Oompa-Loompas"" create a variety of sweets. The film, at many times, boarders on sadistic as Wonka gives each child a taste of their own medicine throughout the tour. The acting is mediocre, the songs and musical numbers are not much better, and about the only bright spot is the little girl playing the role of the spoiled little girl, Varruca, does a  great job in the role. Lots of scenes would frighten small children, adults roll their eyes at many of the jokes throughout the film, which makes me wonder what audience this film is aimed at. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this film unless you grew up with it and it holds a sence of nostalgia for you."	2.0	Not the Best	2003-03-08	23	6	17

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	"Looming in the near future is a Tim Burton remake of the classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (the title of the book from which Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based.) Tim Burton arrogantly proclaimed that the original film was unnecessarily sappy. I had very fond memories of this film and so my wife and I purchased it hoping to see if Tim Burton was right about this movie needing to be remade to be more ""true to the book"".Thanks to the special features we discovered that Roald Dahl (The author of the book) had been responsible for the screen play, with some help of course, but even so the fact that the very man who wrote the book wrote the screenplay means that only this version of the film can come close to the author's vision of his story.When translating a book to film sacrifices have to be made, and in Willy Wonka's case those sacrifices are more so by way of omission than complete overhauls of the story. While the book is different, the flow, the heart, and soul of Roald Dahl's classic tale remain, as does the over all story. What I realized is that while I love Johnny Depp, and Tim Burton the original Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory has held its own since the very early 1970s, and is still a much loved family classic now some 35 years later. A remake is not necessary, and although I look forward to Tim Burton's interpretation Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka for my family and I. In short, this movie is as wonderfully entertaining, and dark, and fun as it was in the 70s. Tim Burton is only kidding himself if he thinks that the original doesn't hold up by today's standard."	4.0	One sweet classic!	2005-01-17	1	1	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A4GS9COS4399Q	Daniel Miller	This movie is billed as a children's movie, and most of the other reviewers cite it as a &quot;wonderful, whimsical&quot; fantasy for kids.  However, I can hardly believe this movie is good for kids to see.  Frankly, the movie is rather frightening.  Two aspects, in particular, stand out as disturbing.  First, the river boat ride through the tunnel is quite scary.  While all the passengers are getting increasingly frightened, Gene Wilder is talking about how the danger is increasing (and &quot;the fires of Hell aglowing&quot;).  In the background, there are quick flashes to shock the viewer, such as a chicken getting its head cut off.  The second and most disturbing component of the movie are the Oompa Lompas.  These are the Wonka factory laborers, and their appearance alone is unsettling (short, green hair, orange face, white eyebrows).  What really makes the Oompa Loompas scary are the songs they sing.  Right after something bad befalls one of the kids on the tour, the Oompa Loompas starting singing, like they are celebrating the child's misfortune.Although widely touted as a fun film for kids, I think that this movie would only disturb and scare children.	2.0	Scary movie, not for children	2002-01-28	32	9	23

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is not a child's movie. Not even close.It's more like an Express Elevator to Hell. Let's be clear on that: whatever it is---aperture to Hell, gateway to a parallel dimension, portal to an alien universe full of diaper-wearing baby-eating carnivores---whatever it is, it's not a childrens' movie.""Willy Wonka"" seethes with Faustian menance and a lurking sense of something sinister afoot, just behind the scenes. It's a kind of cinemo-genetic splice of Pol Pot, Josef Stalin, Satan, and the Teletubbies, with a little shark blood, cobra venom, & curare thrown in for variety.""Willy Wonka"" traumatized me as a child. No kidding. I went to it with my parents, who were under the misconception that this was a fun, light-hearted childrens' romp at the local drive-in; I was digging my nails into my mom's headrest about 10 minutes into the thing. By the time the fat chick turned blue & was about to explode, I'd had it. My Ultra-Conservative, Vaguely Pious Little Boy Instincts had had enough.My parents practically had to do a bootlegger reverse in our whale-like family Oldsmobile to get me out of there, skirting the puzzled & the damned on their way back to the Horror with their popcorn and junior mints. Even then, on the verge of escape, my fingers clasped over my eyes, I was terrified at what hellish horrors the flickering blue-hued mountain-sized silver screen might burn into my young brain. Why did I look, you ask? Why look, on the verge of escape?Because I had to watch.That's the grim, ghoulish secret of ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", director Mel Stuart's cinematic Weapon of Mass Destruction & a screed advocating genocide against naughty children.Don't believe me? Yeah, well, they didn't believe the guy who said the alien diplomatic manual ""To Serve Man"" was a cookbook, either.""Wonka"" is nothing less than the incarnation of what every parent wishes, secretly, to inflict on miscreant children: the Torments of Hell. Oh, and brutal, violent, gory death. And then little men in big-hipped pants come and haul your carcass away.For one, there is the Chocolate Factory itself, a kind of gingerbread Auschwitz with looming smokestacks to match. The River of Chocolate is actually blood red: not brown, or caramel, or black, but red. Like blood. In fact, I think it is a river of blood, nourishing by way of strange caverns the vile, fleshy plants that fasten themselves along its unclean banks.Or take the little troglodyte Oompah Loompahs, who shuttle miscreants into the Factory's Death Traps, after which they're never seen again. Where did they go? Wonka glosses this over like the hardened war criminal he obviously is: don't worry, he coos, the Oompahs (the Stasi? the Gestapo? The SS?) are ""helping them"" get better.Even as a child I knew better. The Little Fat Blue Girl, for one? Yeah, sure, they're ""helping her""---helping mop her bright pink guts off the factory walls after she exploded. Or how about the little boy dragged into a chocolate tube & doubtless suffocated, or Charlie & his grampa's brush with whirring steely death in the Decapitator?Or what of the hellish topography of Wonkaland itself, where candy vats bubble like Yellowstone paint pots, bubbling, spitting, hissing, ready to snare and clutch and catch the unfortunate, usually a child, who gets too close & is scalded.This flick doesn't even bother disguising its real agenda: consider its psychedelic tunnel boat sequence, complete with hallucinatory glimpses of a writhing Conqueror Worm, dead birds, ambulatory guts, & the licking fires of Hell, accompanied by a nearly spastic Wonka yammering about Rowers rowing & ""the Fires of Hell a-Blowing (a film addition not found in the book).Or best of all, consider the character of Willy Wonka himself, played by comic genius Gene Wilder. Wonka is obviously deranged. Wilder surpasses himself in bringing a kind of spastic, deranged, dangerous manginess to the persona of the affable old Dickensian eccentric imagined in Roald Dahl's truly childish children's classic (itself a work of pure unbridled whimsy). To a child, Wonka isn't endearing, he's dangerous. He's the Mad Stranger. You don't talk to him.And why would you, when Wonka looks to be, and let's face it, probably is, a drug addict. Just look at the wretch: the ill-modulated voice, rising from sibilant to screech in seconds. Or the unkempt wispy hair jutting out from the moldy top hat, or the yellowish cankered clothes, or the wild, jerky, drug-addled mannerisms.Is it so difficult to imagine this candy-coated Mengele with his syringe full of lethal blueberry custard, his vivisections done for the day, dispatching a troop of Waffen Oompah Loompahs to haul the latest batch of child-sized black bodybags out the back door of his Gingerbread Dachau while he retreats to the privacy of his miserable, woeful office to break out the syringe, the needle, and the spoon?A child, rightly, recoils from such a Monster.If you let your child be influenced by this tomb-rat, be prepared when he proceeds to torturing small dogs with a cheese slicer in the shed, and from there to trolling the seedier night clubs in search of boyfriends to bring home for sedation, dismemberment, and storage in the refrigerator (or perhaps a chemical vat, in a true homage to the original Sick Willy).It is instructive to learn that Dahl, horrified by the cinematic adaption, filed a lawsuit against the producers and director Stuart, thus preventing them from using his characters again, and thereby scuttling sequels---and perhaps stoppering up a gate to the Land of the Damned.Show this infernal concoction of slow death to the impressionable only if you want to literally carry out Christ's injunction: ""Suffer the little Children.""JSG"	1.0	Sick Willy	2007-08-23	96	24	72

The colors, the performances, and the music all touched my heart.  Like the Wizard of Oz, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, The WIz, and The Music Man, it is the kind of film I saw as a child and feel young all over again when I see it.Gene Wilder is fantastic and the music is beautiful.Well, it came on one evening on ABC Family and our 8 year old got to see most of it.  She was just as enthralled as I had once been.  Unfortunately, the end of the movie continued past her bedtime and we had to put her to bed.I ordered this movie online and now she can watch it when she wants on the computer.  She got to see the end and I then I got her every Roald Dahl book in existence, lol.I can now enjoy this movie too.  Amazon's format is easy and the picture quality is great. We don't have the best (refurbished) computer so this isn't why it looks good.  The sound is fine, too.	5.0	Sharing the Magic	2013-02-04	0	0	0

Blumer	If you chew too much gum, watch too much tv, eat too much chocolate or act like a spoiled brat, you will meet your doom, just like the children in this classic story. Gene Wilder is hilarious in this cautionary tale. Charlie is the likeable if flawed character you are rooting for. This older movie much surpasses the more recent remake with Johnny Depp. It's straightforward and doesn't overthink children's misbehavior. It embodies one of my father's favorite sayings: sometimes kids just have to learn the hard way.	5.0	Children beware	2013-08-30	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the release of this endearing childhood classic, I pay homage to its well-paced direction by Mel Stuart(who gave his son, Peter, a cameo role as a schoolkid), somewhat psychedelic art direction by Harper Golf, and a delightfully tuneful score by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse, featuring the now-classic songs ""The Candy Man"" and ""World of Pure Imagination"".Although Roald Dahl, who wrote the screenplay, took liberties with his original 1964 novel, he and Stuart should be credited with presenting a less warped vision of this tale than Tim Burton's 2004 remake, although that version features certain elements that were more true to the story.Peter Ostrum gives a winsome, but thankfully not cloying performance as young Charlie Bucket, a poor kid living at the edge of an unnamed town, here portrayed by Munich, Germany--which does provide for some great aerial shots-- who delivers newspapers to help feed his family, including his mother, widowed in this film, but married in the story(Diana Sowle,at the time, an American military wife living on a Base in that city) and four bedridden grandparents(Dora Altman, Emel Ziegler, Franziska Liebing, and last, but not least, the lively and irascible Jack Albertson).Not far from the family's hovel is a mysterious candy factory run by an equally enigmatic candymaker named Willy Wonka, who has kept out of the public eye since a rival candymaker trumped him some 20 years earlier.It is interesting to note that Charlie's grandparents have been bedridden for as long as Wonka's factory has been dormant. But soon, Grandpa Joe, who once worked in the factory will come back to life in more ways than one, as will the factory.One day, while on his delivery route, Charlie sees the factory sign light up, and smoke waft out of its stacks. The commentary of a passing tinker(Peter Casell) only adds to the mystery of how the factory is maintained and how candy stores maintain supplies of the delicious Wonka treats when no one is ever seen going in and out of the factory.One day as Charlie is in class, a boy tells his off-kilter and slightly bombastic teacher, Mr. Turkentine(David Battley) of the announcement of Wonka's to open his factory, and class is dismissed.News reporters( Jack Lathain, Stephen Dunne, and Michael Gahr) chronicle the progress of the search for the five golden tickets hidden in any variety of Wonka bars, which will enable their lucky finders to tour the candymaker's factory.As the drudgery of the Bucket's lives continues, Charlie spends his meager earning's on a Wonka bar and is given one for his birthday. Neither yields a golden ticket.The first child to find one is a gluttonous boy from Germany named Augustus Gloop(Michael Bollner), whose mother( Ursula Reit), indulges his overeating.The next to find one is a spoiled rich girl named Veruca Salt(Julie Dawn Cole), whose father(Roy Kinnear) owns a nut factory, but has the women in his factory unwrap Wonka bars until a ticket is found.In the meantime, we see the worldwide mass hysteria over finding the tickets among computer scientists, in candy stores around the globe,at auctions, and even with the overly dramatic wife of a kidnapping victim(Gloria Manon), who is conflicted over turning over her boxes of Wonka bars in exchange for her husband's life.The next recipient is the brassy gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde(Denise Nickerson), whose car-dealer/politician father(Leonard Stone)muzzles in on his daughter's press conference to plug his business. Violet became a candybar muncher in lieu of a champion gum-chewer when learning of the contest.The fourth recipient is Mike Tevee(Paris Themmen), whose mother(Dodo Denney) indulges his sitting before the TV all day long, dressed as a cowboy and firing his toy pistol at the set every so often. It is unclear how he located his rare find.Charlie's discouragement grows in the midst of it all. His mother consoles himThere is further discouraging news that the final ticket is found. But when it turns out to be a fake, Charlie buys one final bar with money found in the street, and soon, the whole world will be his!Appearing to every ticket finder is one  Mr. Slugworth(Gunter Meisner) offering  the children a better deal if they will reveal a secret about their host-to-be.While not quite resembling the title character, Gene Wilder captures his eccentricities as he guides his guests through his factory, complete with an edible landscape, a chocolate river with a chocolate stirring waterfall, and odd little workers called Oompa Loompas who run the factory and sing moralistic songs as various calamities befall the children, when each surrender to their worst vices.Charlie and Grandpa Joe just barely escapes being annihiliated after illicitly sipping fizzy lifting drinks and rising up to a ceiling fan, in yet another departure from the original tale.Despite a day of unusual events, the one who should do so will win the day. It can only be hoped that wisdom will come with age for the others.40 years later, ""Willy Wonka"" still shines as a winning tale of the triumph of virtue for one young boy, happily ending with his fortunes literally on the up and up."	5.0	A World of Pure Imagination!	2011-06-30	4	2	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	ADP2WMF7L0BVK	"""decayedangel"""	I freaking love this movie. This movies had so many subliminal messages. The whole thing is about greed. Sure, this movie might come off a harmless childrens movie but you have to be an adult to read between the lines of this movie.I have heard that they are gonna be making a remake of this movie next year. They orginally wanted Marilyn Manson to play Willie Wonka. But due to people's bitchin'...he won't because people think that will ruin the movie's reason...or some crap like that. But if you knew anything about this movie...have you ever watched this movie on television lately? They have cut out the scene where they are going down the chocolate river in the boat because of a music video that Manson did. The music video immitates that scene but in a much more morbid type of way than in the movie. Because of that...thats why they have cut that scene from being shown on television.I love this movie because it is fun and great. It may not follow the same dialogue as the book did but who cares. Movies are uaully always better than a book. If you are into movies that have a good twisted heart to it then this is the movie for you.

It will forever be a classic for young and old:)  The features of the DVD are superb, especially the behind-the-scenes documentary which features the actors who played the 5 children, as well as Gene Wilder and one of the Oompa-Loompas!  The commentary of the 5 actors was entertaining although the Augustus Gloop actor didn't say much.  Of course, his character was the first to be ""voted off"" the chocolate factory but at the same time, the actor was often talked over by the other stars.  Maybe the other actors have Jewish parentage and decided it's payback time over their German actor."	5.0	Pure brilliance	2003-04-26	3	1	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AMO3NCG95J80Q	"Doug Thompson ""laffnstock"""	This is a classic which was made in the glory days of cinema -- when it comes to moral content.  The Johnny Depp version is up to date and complies more with the bood, gaining the squirrel scene in which this version had the oompa-loompas creating golden easter eggs.  I wouldn't say I prefer the Depp version to this one, but who would anyway?  Simply because we're more aquainted to the originals.  And the soundtrack?  Timeless.This film is a real dessert of a treat from the time the chocolately liquid covers the TV screen to the time the Wonkavator vanishes into the lonely sky.  I only wish Dahl would've let Warner Brothers film the sequel so viewers could vision Charlie's life after the Wonkavator ride.  But you still can't go wrong with this timeless classic.This film was created when G-rated films were genuinely G-rated.  I do have a problem with the boat scene.  As a kid, I was always disturbed by the psychadelic atmosphere where the weird creatures emerge in the background, and the chicken has its head cut off.  I happen to find that scene disturbing to children.  The new version has its scary moment with the squirrel scene as well.  Other than that, the kids will love it!This digitally-remastered and upgrated-to-Dolby-Digital-5.1 DVD is sure to dazzle both the long-term fans of this movie and those who have never even seen it before.I would recommend both!	5.0	An All-Time Classic	2006-01-18	1	1	0

Each participant harbors rather rotten personality traits, either insensitivity towards others, Letharginator neurosis, obnoxiousness, excessive gluttony, &/or disobedience. Total self-uncontrol. And the parents were spineless. Basically, they are all brats ----- except for one. The chosen one. He who demostrates deportment & consideration.I Am reminded of Dr. LaVey's sign on the bookshelf in the purple parlour, ""Do not remove books from shelves. Anyone caught removing books from shelves, will have their hands amputated."" This is in fact, the exremely simular way in which Mr. Wonka operates his factory. Unfortunately for them, they did not bother to really read the disclaimer at the beginning of the tour. The question is, would it have mattered anyway?For about the first 45 minutes or so, we become acquainted with the characters' predispositions towards the afore-mentioned traits.There's Varuca Salt, an unsufferable brat devoid of manners. There's a TV-loving cowboy kid whose entire existence seems to be centered around the boob-tube. There's a gum-chewing girl who does not listen to advice when given, & then there's a German boy who can't get enough food ---- whatever it is. In every case, they exhibit irresponsible & just annoying tendencies that need to be abated. Every one of these, after being tested, meets with an appropriate & poetic fate, all commandeered by the resident God, Willy Wonka.The infamous ""Golden Ticket,"" the instrument of their greed, brought them to The Chocolate Factory, but this is natural, for what candy-loving child can resist a trek into the wonderful world of Wonka?Indeed, all of the events leading up to the gates seemed planned.Within the hallowed walls of that chocomantium, there are total environments at every turn, each with their respective rides & attractions. Mr. Wonka makes a wonderful host; animated & witty. We get to see the ""Umpa-Loompahs"" from ""Umpahland"", & become familiar with their lore ----- it seems that kind Mr. Wonka took them in because they were being preyed upon by ""Pernicious Knids"", & other marvellous creatures from Umpahland.

Seewald	I've seen all the anamorphic widescreen versions of this precious classic, and WB's latest attempt to try to fool us with another widescreen release the same as that of the 30th anniversary edition (images cut off top and bottom), has only proven to consumers that the people at Warner Brothers are the fools. It's the pan & scan version, but with the image further stretched top and bottom. This is cutting off even more of the original 4:3 image, then letting your TV or projector do the vertical squeeze to stretch the image width to fill up the entire 16x9 screen. Now side images are cut off as well, because the widescreen releases WBs are formatting from are from a pan & scan image, which blows up the picture to fill a 4:3 television, leaving images cut off normally at the sides, but now top and bottom as well.If you already have the 30th anniversary widescreen edition, please don't waste your money as I did and buy the 2005 edition, as you will only have the exact same release, but with a different cover.	1.0	This version (June 25, 2005) is screwed up as the other widescreen version	2009-04-21	27	15	12

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1FJX3NFVPFPUG	"""dwankum"""	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), directed by Mel Stuart, with a run time of 100 min, is a classic family/fantasy/musical that received an Oscar nomination for Best Song Score.In this movie Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), a legendary candy maker hides five Golden Tickets in his candy bars.  The finders of the tickets will get a tour of Wonka's top secret chocolate factory plus a lifetime supply of Wonka chocolate, providing he or she follows the tour's strict rules.  Poor, young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum), one of the lucky winners, , brings along his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson)on the tour.  Wonka's arch enemy asks Charlie to steal an &quot;Everlasting Gobstopper&quot;, a candy that lasts literally forever, from the factory, but Charlie can't bring himself to steal.  The other 4 winners, who are all rude, nasty children, have also been approached.  Inside the factory, they are awestruck by Wonka's operation, which includes a chocolate river, candy trees, plates and everything edible.  There are also &quot;Oompa Loompas&quot;, tiny little workers that sing.  You'll need to watch the movie, it is fantastic and has a wonderful moral to the story.  It has a tremendous, surprise ending!!!!!	5.0	A classic family movie, fun but with a bit of dark humor als	2004-02-05	0	0	0

On this 30th Anniversary DVD you get the great movie in almost new looking, vibrant colors and sound and also a few extras like a commentary by all 5 Golden Ticket winners, all grown up talking about the film.Adapated from the book, it starts out as Willy Wonka, the famed and mysterious candyman finally decides to open the gates to his chocolate factory, but only to 5 lucky people who find A Golden Ticket. Inside, his factory a world of wonder, sweets, pure imagination and more sweets await!I'd pick this up in a heart beat! This is a great family buy and every child should see this movie (if not read the book). If you're shopping around for more movies, check out WIZARD OF OZ as well.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A900UBB4HD16W	"Egbert Cheeseman ""Goo goo g'joob"""	"The famous/infamous Boat Ride Scene in this movie is probably the most talked about piece of film in these reviews, so I thought I'd spill my thoughts about it. To be honest, I love it. It represents a speck of horror, a dark flaw in the sparkling crystal of the movie, and more macroscopically, our lives... that somehow makes the crystal so much more mysterious and fascinating.The entire movie crescendoes to the moment when Charlie lays down the Everlasting Gobstopper on Mr. Wonka's desk, which he does despite such potentially intimidating things as the boat ride and the also famous ""You LOSE!! Good DAY, sir!"" tirade. I think Charlie does this because he has carefully paid attention to the fact that Mr. Wonka, despite some threatening stuff, is fundamentally good, and has only illustrated some of the consequences of not listening to him to some people who really should pay attention. ""Why don't they listen to Mr. Wonka?"" Charlie asks plaintively at one point... but then at another, he himself and Grandpa Joe don't listen and go floating up via Fizzy Lifting Drinks.... even they are sinners... but can be and are forgiven. In a nutshell, I think Mr. Wonka represents God, the chocolate factory represents Heaven, and Charlie represents how one has to behave to get there. The boat ride represents what could happen to us if we don't listen. We are all ON that boat ride right now... the rowers keep on rowing, and they certainly aren't showing any sign that they are slowing. Throughout my life, I plan to do my best to give back the Everlasting Gobstopper... but sometimes I am probably gonna have a few hits of Fizzy Lifting Drinks even though Mr. Wonka told me not to. :  )  S"	5.0	BOAT RIDE SCENE	2006-04-23	15	13	2

Looking back, the Willie Wonka movie was this amazing fantasy world I was able to daydream about for years. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a touching and influential film that intrigued both adults and children alike.  Charlie's impoverished lifestyle and willingness to give his meager earnings away is a lesson every adult and child should learn--selflessness and pure generosity, a kind heart in a world of selfishness.  The DVD is great since I never saw the behind the scenes/documentary side of the movie.  With all the reality TV out there, you'd think there'd be more about the movie and the actors.  Well you can find it on the DVD, along with some other great extras.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3I6NPWJ37S1WR	E. Palonen	How could the American Film Institute leave this off of the top 100 films of all time?  This film is absolutely brilliant. Sharp, witty, humorous and insightful, this is a movie that appeals to anyone and everyone. Gene  Wilder's performance is eerily magnificent. The scripts and sets reward  those who are scrutinous and attentive. In nearly every new scene, there is  a little &quot;hidden&quot; joke that easily slips out of the normal  viewer's sight. Watch the movie again, and pay close attention...you'll see  what I'm talking about.  I have seen this movie easily over hundreds of  times. It is constantly in my DVD player...a great addition to anyone's  movie collection. Many critics complain about this movie's oddities, but  after watching it again, their comments are silenced.  This movie has  it all: Humor, suspense, deep and intriguing moments, lessons, advice, wit  and overall entertainment. A joy to the eyes, ears, and mind.	5.0	Brilliant.	2000-07-29	7	5	2
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1	"Eric E. Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'"""	"Wow.This is one of three movies that defined my more informative years. And this collection (I happened to get #8501 of the 100,000 that are floating around on Fizzy Lifting Drinks) is incredible. The slipcase pulls away and the first thing you see is the infamous Golden Ticket - which did advertise a contest from when the set was originally released. But it's a perfect copy of the ticket from the film.Delving deeper into this set, we find a slip folder with the 40th anniversary logo. Within are several copies of inter-company notes and letters recognizing the casting, discussing the making of the film, a copy of a hand-written letter from Gene Wilder to the producers, and a cover letter from Wily Wonka explaining the Golden Ticket contest.Further in the box is a high-gloss 130 page full colour paperback book entitled 'Pure Imagination'; its contents cover everything from the casting process to a ""Where are They Now?"". It's very well written and very insightful.THEN, we find two boxes of 'Wonka Bars': the smaller box (6x3"") has a hinged lid that reveals four pencils (with logos for Hair Creme, Banana, Blueberry, and Snozzberry; I have yet to open them, so I cannot tell you if the snozzberries do indeed taste like snozzberries). Also included is a thumb-sized eraser with the Wonka Bar logo.The larger of the boxes (averaged DVD size) contains the BD of the feature, the DVD of the feature and a DVD disc with two featurettes, the first of which is director waxes reminiscent about everything he did in the production and along with the spots with his kids (who both had minor roles in the film) we get to see some of their favourite moments throughout. The second featurette (Pure Imagination) is an original (and very dated) behind the scenes focusing on the writer of the novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. It moves on through the process of coming up with the sets, props and musical numbers.I have yet to listen to any commentary tracks, but I think it's safe to say it fits just as well as everything else WB gave us with this great collection of memorabilia. So live like the Oompa-Loompas and lose yourself in a film of pure imagination....."	5.0	Willy Wonka's Limited Edition Blu-Ray Box Set	2012-03-27	4	4	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	"I remember watching Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory as a kid and not being able to get those unusual characters and songs out of my head. The story is based on the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", although the key word here is ""based."" Still, the movie is a great children's movie, and one of the movies that you can pick up and watch again later in life and watch with your kids.Really this story can be looked at in various ways. It is a kid's movie but timeless because it is has so many songs, unusual characters, and fantasy elements. The oompa-loompas, who work for Willy Wonka, sing songs, each containing a moral or lesson. There are many songs in the movie, including the famous ""Candy Man"" song as well as a few by Gene Wilder. There are also many visuals, such as colors and gadgets that Willy Wonka controls in his factory. If you haven't seen this film and want to visualize it, think a psychedelic Candyland, with a little of Wizard of Oz thrown in.One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) first comes out as the winners are awaiting the entrance into his factory. He comes out with a cane and slowly ambles to the gate only to do a flip at the end. I thought this was a fitting scene for Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka, because with this character, and in many other instances, what you see is not always what you get. This scene just seemed to typify the unusual oddity of Willy Wonka, and Wilder's ability to capture that essence of eccentricity makes the film a little more than just your average children's movie.In the story, the first five kids to get the golden sealed Willy Wonka Chocolate Bar will get a chance to visit the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory. Charlie, a good-hearted kid who is from a poor bed-ridden family, has hopes of being one of the lucky five. There is a mad dash to get a hold of the winning chocolate bar, and, after one of the supposed winners turns out to be a fraud, Charlie gets the chance to win the final spot. Although it is a kid's movie, there is a message that plays out (this being that goodness will eventually be rewarded), and we see that once the five winners visit the factory. Of all five children, Charlie is the only one that is a truly honest and good-natured child, and, because of this, he is the only one ultimately rewarded. The rest of the children all have their flaws and are punished accordingly because of these. Because this in large part a children's movie, I don't see any problem with the characters, especially the children, being pretty much prototypical and one-dimensional. The bigger emphasis in the film is on Charlie, and his hopes of not only winning this once-in-a-lifetime chance to visit the factory, but also to better the life of his family.While some may view the film as having a few ""dark"" elements (by the various methods the children are dispatched), it really is a fun movie with a good message overall. It really is a one-of-a-kind movie, and highly recommended. Hopefully ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", with Johnny Depp, will also be this fun."	4.0	Wilder steals the show, great children's movie with a lesson	2005-07-19	5	4	1

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	ACVNA57PI4DLV	Francois Tremblay	"Is there anything more indulgent and sensual than eating chocolate ? Anything that can be featured in a movie for children, that is ? Willy Wonka is the owner of a mysterious chocolate factory, and he is ready to reveals its secrets - but what child could resist their lure before getting handed a gruesome fate ?The structure of WWatCF is reminiscent of Lord of the Rings - as we see child after child falling into temptation. Its premise is at least less blatant than Harry Potter's. The moral of the movie is ""be moderate and honest"".Gene Wilder brings his tremendous energy and ambiguity to perfection in this movie. He is suitably frantic and dark as the eccentric Willy Wonka. The Oompa-Loompas are the stone-faced Muses, as if from a Greek tragedy, breaking in omnious songs, whirling around and giving out morals for the patient children.While the sense of wonder in this movie is not as high as it could be, due to the limits of special effects of the time, this is as good as children's movies get."	4.0	A Greek Tragedy for children	2003-04-02	4	3	1
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K	Fred	This is a nice collector edition, but I'm viewing the Blu-ray version as I type and it's not a very impressive HD transfer at all. I owned the DVD version and gave it to my older sister when she was over recently so I replaced it with this. I will compare the DVD version included in this set via my PS3 which offers decent up scaling. I find many of these HD transfers are sorely lacking and it's pathetic to waste money on many of them. I'm watching the scene where they enter the magical candy land area, honestly I thought it would look breathtaking... really doesn't.The tin pencil case is great I keep my check writing pens and checkbook in it. You do get a golden ticket and the book is quite nice, lots of behind the scenes photos and info.In the end it's not bad for the money, but the star is the movie in HD and I do not think this delivers. 5 star edition. 3 star Blu-ray and that's being generous.	3.0	Good	2011-07-07	5	0	5
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A32JWFWXERFMRK	free2be	I never saw this movie when it first came out in the early 70's. But on a recent trip to Las Vegas my sister and I played the Willy Wonka slot machine (appropriately it's a penny machine) and had a blast sailing down the chocolate river and getting those Wonka space ride bonuses. I was sufficiently intrigued by the video clips on the slot machine to rent the movie from amazon when I got home. I loved it! Gene Wilder strikes just the right balance as the magician-genius chocolate factory owner, Peter Ostrum is wonderful as the poor boy yearning to provide for his mother and invalid grandparents, and Jack Albertson is the ever supportive and encouraging grandpa. This movie is all about the loving heart of a child and those who believe in him- and also about 'monster' brats who don't measure up. I googled the Wonka kids and found out that all of the child actors in this movie are alive and well. A very happy real world ending.	5.0	Oompa Loompa Diddledy Doo	2014-05-29	0	0	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2VE83MZF98ITY	"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick"""	The film is based on a much-loved children's book, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', by Roald Dahl.  Dahl wasn't always happy with the changes made between his book and the film, and wasn't always consulted on them.  Today probably more people are familiar with the film sequence of events than the book.  Charlie is a down-on-his-luck boy who is nonetheless optimistic and happy.  He and his mother work to tend for their bed-ridden family members, all living together in a one-room home.One day there is an annoucement that Wonka is going to open his factory to visitors, to be chosen more or less at random through finding the Golden Tickets, contained in Wonka bars (a brilliant marketing device back then).  Scenes of shoppers' frenzy are shown all around with world, including a Wonka delivery van shown arriving at the White House.The five golden tickets are found all around the world - the first one in Dusselheim, Germany, by the fat boy, Augustus Gloop (played by Michael Boliner, who is now a tax accountant in Munich, and is still rather large).  The second ticket was found in the UK, by spoiled brat, Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole, the only Wonka child still acting), whose father, Roy Kinnear, is a well-known actor in British cinema.  The third ticket was found in the USA, by gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson, now an accountant at a nuclear plant in Colorado), whose used-car-salesman father was played by Leonard Stone (who was selected over Jim Bakus).  The fourth ticket was also won in the USA, by Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen, considered a real brat by most of the cast and crew); his frantic mother was played by Dodo Denny (later Nora Denny), who was one of the few minor characters in the film to consistently act after this film.  The final ticket at first is reported to be won by some shady businessman from Paraguay, but in the end, that is proven to be a forgery.  Of course, Charlie buys a Wonka Bar expecting nothing, and gets the ticket.An ominous figure, Slugworth (the arch-enemy of Wonka - who knew chocolate makers also made arch-enemies?), appears to each of the winners, whispering in their ears.  Charlie is also confronted, and promised a reward should he bring Slugworth an example of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper.  One wonders why (a) any candy maker would make a candy that never wears out (thus defeating re-sales), and (b) why Slugworth can't just buy one himself when they are released, analyse it and ruin his own factory the same way?  But I digress...  Gunter Meisner, a very prolific German actor, played the villain, who wasn't in the book (nor was the 'gobstopper plot').The grand day of the event, the winners enter the factory with great fanfare, meeting Wonka (Gene Wilder) for the first time, and get the first taste of his bizarre sense of theatre.  (It is reported not only Wilder's idea for the limping/somersault introduction to the crowd, but also a condition of his accepting the role.)  From that point on, what was truth?  It is ironic that Wonka's entrance doesn't occur until the film is half over.  What we remember of the film comes after this, but over half the film is actually set-up.  This is rather like the Wizard of Oz, where most of the film is done before we see 'the major character', although admittedly Wonka is far more prominent than Oz's balloonist.Wonka, the man of mystery, only ever became even more of a mystery as the tour progressed.  He is constantly switching his words ('we have so much time and so little to do'), and there are surprises at every turn.  Wonka borrows a lot of his key phrases (Ogden Nash, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde) and there are a lot of fantasy-inspired elements (Alice in Wonderland, Lord of the Rings).At each major scene, something ghastly seems to happen, but in epic-fantasy form, it doesn't seem to matter to the majority, who proceed onward with their quest.  In the chocolate room, Augustus Gloop meets his untimely exit from the factory by falling in the chocolate river.  Violet turns into a blueberry by chewing experimental gum, and has to be squeezed (squoozed?).  Veruca, in the room with the geese who lay the golden eggs, turns out to be a bad egg herself, but has a sporting chance of going down a chute with an inactive furnace.  Mike Teevee shrinks in the Wonka version of the Star Trek transporter beam, leaving in the end only Charlie, who is denied his prize of a lifetime of chocolate for a minor infraction.It would seem that Wonka had a sinister side in many ways - the boat that carries the prize winners only seated eight, implying that Wonka knew someone would be missing. The Wonkamobile only had seats for four guests. Of course, the children apparently all had sinister sides, too, including Charlie, until the end.  None of them let Wonka know of their Slugworth contact.In the end, we never know what becomes of the fallen questers - we are led to believe that in this candy factory they got their just desserts.  The Oompa-Loompas put the moral to each downfall in song, with a 1970s karaoke-type presentation of the lyrics as they sing.  In the end, of course, goodness and justice win out, as the factory is given to Charlie after his act of unwarranted kindness toward Wonka.Director Stuart always saw this film as a 'realistic' fantasy film.  Those things that are not over the top are very ordinary.  The people are not superheroes, and the situations, while fantastic, are not beyond the credible.  Stuart also did his best for 'real' reaction - the kids had never seen Gene Wilder before his appearance at the door, the chocolate room in the factory, or the Oompa-Loompas prior to the first scene, either, so their reactions are more natural.A great film for children and adults!	5.0	Candy is dandy...	2004-05-25	131	103	28

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I	"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan"""	"After watching the new movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" I knew that I had to get the original movie on DVD, and that's exactly what I did. I'm now in my early 20's, so I grew up watching the original movie, but never have bought it until now and I'm glad I did.The movie is just as fantastic as when I watched it originally, it's just one of those classics that never get old no matter how many times you watch it. From the incredible acting of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, to the oompa loompas to the fantastic scores, this movie really does have it all, even though it doesn't really follow the novel as well as the new movie does.I have to applaud the team who worked on this DVD. When watching the movie, my entire family noticed how the picture was so colorful and clear. In my entire life, never have I see this movie in such color. I'm used to the aged, faded versions that always come on TV, but they have restored the movie perfectly on DVD. It's so colorful; the next best thing is to literally be there in person. Especially when they enter the candy room with the chocolate waterfall, it really is a feast for the eyes.The Menu Screen for both the main page and special features are extravagant, simply amazing detail on both screens.This DVD also has some very good special featuresPure Imagination: The Story of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory- This documentary lasts around thirty minutes long and gives us a look into the making of this timeless film. In it, there are new interviews with the director, Gene Wilder and all five children now grown up. It's interesting to hear how everything was made and hearing they kids', now adults, opinion of the film.  The most interesting part is that the documentary tells where and what Peter Ostrum (Charlie Bucket) and the others have been doing since the end of this film. This also includes footage of Roald Dahl, the author of the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", on the set of the movie but it doesn't have him speaking any.4 Sing-Along Songs: It's what it says, four songs from the movie are shown and the lyrics to the songs are at the bottom of the screen as they sing so you can sing along too. This feature is very interesting; the four songs that are shown are ""I've Got A Golden Ticket"", ""Pure Imagination"", ""I Want It Now"", and Veruca's Oompa Loompa song. It's nice that they give the lyrics so we know what they are saying, but sadly for some reason they don't have lyrics for the last song. I guess they figure that the words that pop up every now and then during the Oompa Loompa song is considered lyrics and none need to be added, but they should have. Even though the last song doesn't have full lyrics, this is still a pleasure to listen too, especially if you like the songs of the film.Vintage 1971 Featurette: This is a shorter and old version of the making of the movie ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"". The film is very grainy, which is understandable because it is so old. This short, under ten minute, documentary mainly focuses on the set during the Chocolate room scene. Overall an o.k. addition, but the previous ""Pure Imagination"" documentary is far superior. But it's still nice to have an old documentary included that you can't find anywhere else. The more extras the merrier!Still Gallery: 18 black and white pictures that show scenes from the movie taken on set. It's interesting to see a few behind the scenes pics but the majority of the pictures are just black and white pictures of scenes from the movie.Theatrical Trailer: A longer than expected trailer for the movie ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". A very good trailer, but once again the film is faded and grainy. It goes to show how far superior the actually movie on this DVD is compared to the original film and what is shown a lot of the times on TV.The movie also has audio commentary with the Wonka kidsOverall it is easy to tell that this DVD was a labor of love. Everything on this is fantastic and wasn't just slapped together for a fast release, but you can tell that the people who worked on this DVD took their time and made this the best it could be, and it is. I was very impressed with how well this DVD came out! It is a must buy for everyone who loves Roald Dahl's incredible story about one kid who had nothing and ended up having it all.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1QQPJFB5GBSQR	Geneva Nielsen	If one really looks at this movie it can be viewed and then discussed with your children.  It lends itself to discussion about how children need to listen to instructions, do as they're instructed to avoid unforseen  consequences, how sometimes a trusted adult may ask you to do something  that's scary to you but you'll be delighted with the outcome, it's about  dreaming, it's about fantasy, and it's a good message to permissive parents  that the rest of the world probably won't let their precious little darling  get away with bad behaviors and they shouldn't condition their children to  believe anything to the contrary.  My children and I love the bright colors  and the hooky music.

I've seen this film so many times, and am proud to say that I saw it when it was first released - at the Coolidge Corner movie theater in Brookline, Massachusetts - and there were a handful of kids, plus myself.Talk about magic.  This movie has it all.  From the moment we encounter the ""contest"" for the ""golden tickets,"" and we're introduced to ""Charlie,"" and his Uncle (played remarkably well by Jack Albertson), we realize who the winner will be, and of course, there are all the other kids and their parents, plus the villain (wonderfully planted to test the kids' integrity).There's singing and dancing, and to hear Gene Wilder's voice is terrific, not to mention seeing his comic genius, even in this children's movie.  Then there are the ""Ooompa Loompas"" and the tale which is told about them...incredibly sweet.Of course the ending is a little bit of a twist, but it fits in with the ""happily ever after"" agenda which Willy Wonka is hoping for, and he is not disappointed.  ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factor"" was the book, and this film matches it very well.For an afternoon, evening, or anytime spent with the family, this is a classic.

With many talents in this movie, what could you not want in this movie?=+= Plot =+=I saw a number of 1 star reviews talking about how it was not close to the book at all. Yes, I was a little mad that it was way off, but hey they still got most of the parts. And besides, the lesson in this movie is more important then being close to the book. Also Harpor Gauff (I think that's his name) came up with the design for the Chocolate room. The way that the children were looking in awe was actually their real actions toward this new room. It was much better then the globbed hunk of junk that is the 2005 movie.=+= Casting =+=This cast was absoulutly incredible! Featureing Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, Nora Denney as Mrs.Tevee, Roy Kinnear as Mr.Salt, and Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. And Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket, Julie Dawn Cole as Veruca Salt, Denise Nickerson as Violet Beauregarde, Paris Themmen as Mike Tevee, and Michael Bollner as Augustus Gloop. Absoulutly perfect cast.=+= Music =+=Anthony Newly came up with all the songs in this movie. Mel Stuart went to him and his two compainians to make the soundtrack. Sammy Davis Jr. did 'Candy Man'. Heres' a little fact for you. Sammy Davis Jr. wanted to do candy man and play the candy store man, but he was shot down (not literaly of course). Also they only used one song that was in Rohald Dahl's book, but the song is gone from my mind.=+= Closing Statements =+=Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory is a classic film for our time. But, it was a box office disaster when it came out. It has now been 35 years scince it came out, but it it is still perfect. Looking for a good movie to watch on the couch? Then pick up this great family film, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'.Total: 5-5	5.0	Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory	2006-07-11	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2GRC6IJRA7W4H	HeadbangerDuh	I saw this movie a couple of years after I read the book. It is not exactly the same story as the book. In fact, there is so much changed that it's actually a little hard to believe it is the same story. I think Gene Wilder's character is horrible, not true to the book at all. He was supposed to be a nice, funny little man, not a sarcastic wise guy. But other than that, the movie is sometimes funnier than the book. Like when they show all the craze for the Wonka Bars. This is a nice, funny movie for families, but I would reccomend reading the book first. Also, those Oompa-Loompas can get really annoying, with their 'Doop-a Day-Doo' song.	3.0	Not True To Da Book	2004-05-17	17	1	16

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A28MM46KI4EQB2	HeavyMetalSushi	This movie is absolutely classic!  I grew up with it, and I still love it to this day.  I do like Tim Burton's remake of it,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory [Blu-ray], but there is no denying that the original is and will always be the best, and Gene Wilder is undoubtedly the best Willy Wonka, may he rest in peace.Those of you who are familiar with the movie though need no shpeal on how great it is, because you already know.  As far as this 40th anniversary set is concerned, my wife and I both think it's amazing!  There's so much cool memorobilia in this set (see the product page to get an idea).The digital transfer onto Blu-Ray format is amazing...the colors and quality of the picture have been greatly improved, and the same can be said of the sound quality.  This is how this movie should be enjoyed!What's even better was the price I got this at.  I saw it in some stores for $60+, and even Amazon has the regular price listed at around $65, but leave it to good ol Amazon to run all kinds of sales, some of them really great...I scored this set on here for $24.99!  Great bargain!  There are only 100,000 copies of this, so if you're a big Willy Wonka fan, I'd jump on this now.  Very cool!	5.0	Great Set!	2013-02-08	0	0	0

You want to know what I think of the BD version, right?My short answer: This BD looks and sounds so good that I've already given away my DVD of it.The Blu-ray Disc of Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory is the best I have ever seen of the film. Image quality is sharp & clean and the colors stand out like candy. The DolbyTrueHD sound is excellent allowing all the dialogue and songs to come through crystal-clear.This BD case is like a book with many pages for the fans. My ONLY (small) regret is that the back cover containing all the BD information is not printed on the book, and instead is merely a printed page that eventually comes loose and detaches after a short while (whereas my ""Easy Rider"" BD is the same type of book and the information is printed on the back cover - much better!).If you like (or love) this movie and are wondering if the BD is worth the money, wonder no more.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A35XFZN4MWNKK4	ianphillips@uk.dreamcast.com	In my own opinion, Willy Wonka And The Chocolate factory stands as one of the greatest childrens movies ever made, along with other such notable classics like The Wizard Of Oz (1939) and E.T.(1982). Strangely enough though this has never enjoyed quite such recognition yet is an out and out classic regardless and will have both kids and adults enthralled. Adapted from Roald Dahls famous book, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, this film makes compelling viewing from beginning to end with wild-eyed Gene Wilder playing Willy Wonka who ruthlessly sorts out the honest from the two faced when they visit his extravagent chocolate factory. The child performers in this are all excellent with Julie Dawn in particular putting in an amusing and effective performance as spoilt brat, Veruca Salt. The chocolate factory sets are stunning and extravagent and the film is packed full of surprises and on moments even has much darker undertones. Yet on the whole this film is fun for all the family and it stands as a truly timeless classic!	5.0	A Classic!	2002-12-16	1	0	1

I first watched the film as a 3rd grader in La Salle and eversince, loved it.  The story of Willy Wonka and Charlie is absolutely wonderful. Gene Wilder is such a great entertainer.  The film has a very good story accompanied with very fine song selections.  Children will surely have fun watching this film and a lot of good moral lessons could be learned from it and surely will touch their lives after.  It proves that with true faith, perserverance and dedication, one can achieve anything.  A real timeless classic.  A splendid film that the whole family will enjoy watching together. &quot;Come with me, and we'll be, in a world of pure imagination.......&quot;	5.0	A VERY OOMPAH-LOOMPAH FILM!!!	2001-05-26	4	1	3

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2RZUFRYRHTRS8	jasoneducator	"More people are reconnecting with the original movie adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic work these days. They won't be disappointed. The 70s version of the movie gives us a Wonka who is far more benign than Johnny Depp's current version. Wilder revels in his role as candy magician, and maintains a charming enteraining eccentricity as he shares the wonders of his candy palace.Coming back to the movie after years away, I was amazed by the wittiness of it all. Some of Wilder's turns of phrase remind of books like ""The Phantom Tollbooth"". ""We have so much time and so little to do, wait reverse that."" It's hard to give a sense of how witty it is in the review. The search for the golden tickets is hilarious and cheerfully goes beyond the book with tongue in cheek newsreporting, auctions for boxes of Wonka bars and even a ransom for Wonka bars.The acting is mostly stellar, although I'll prefer the boy of the newer version to the perfection of the Charlie Bucket of this one. He is so innocent that he's just a little syrupy sweet for me. Grandpa Joe is great though, especially in the scene when he gets out of bed out of years of sleep.This is a great movie, that rare children's movie that's an equal pleasure for adults and kids alike.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2C5LA07JCDWTN	"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of those rare films that has made a seamless transition from book to screen. The adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic is true to form and delivers the goods. Children of any age will relate to candy, chocolates, magic, and mystery; and Willy Wonka has it all. The characters are interesting and each have their faults: Augustus is a glutton, Violet is obsessive compulsive, Mike T.V.'s affliction is fairly obvious and Veruca Salt is the perfect spoiled brat. Charlie seemingly does not have any imperfections except for one that is revealed at the conclusion of the film: he is TOO kindhearted. All of the actors do a great job especially Gene Wilder who Willy Wonka is wry and cynical but a true dreamer. This is a timeless film for people of all ages. The factory itself has aged very well, it still looks like magic everytime Willy opens the door into the chocolate room, and don't deny it every single one of us would love just 5 minutes alone in that room! There is only one questionable scene in the film which comes during the boat ride sequence and really has no place in the film. It depicts animals eating each other, a chicken being decapitated, and a snake running across a woman's face. These images should not have been included and are scary to children. Some of the other musical sequences are quite trite as well. The one in particular is when Charlie's mother is singing as he is walking home(talk about skip or fast forward). But regardless, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a timeless, magical journey of a film and should not be missed by anyone. Highly Recommended.	5.0	Pure Imagination	2002-04-19	3	1	2
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AC25PQ2BX1HZ1	JC	"I watched it when I was 5 or 6 yrs old. I had no idea of the moral behind it, and it was horror movie to me. To me, it was a 'high body count' film with kids 'dying' all over the screen. The drowning in the chocolate river was scary and the Umpa-Lumpas looked like monsters. It was almost pervertic because there was this song and dance when kids are 'dying' all over in a beautiful chocolate factory.And for a typical 5, 6 yrs old kid, isn't it a dream to watch a lot of TV while chewing gum, eating candy and nagging your parents to buy more toys ? (you can't teach a dog a lesson by beating him up unless he understands what he did wrong)However, as an adult, I really loved the movie and regreted that I didn't not watch it again at, say, 10 years old. I thought I knew what the movie was all about and because I was turned off big time when I was a kid, I never considered watching it again until quite recently. It should have a disclaimer ""Not for immature kids who do not understand the concept of morality"".Also, it will be helpful if the supervising adult clarifies some of the concepts to the kid afterwards. Because Charlie's character does not stand out in the film as he is not a look-at-me screaming & flashy boy, and kids with short attention span might not understand why Charlie is rewarded in the end."	5.0	great movie if you understand the moral of the story.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"I have 2 children ages 3 and 1, so I've seen this video numerous times and I enjoy it each time I see it.  The story revolves around Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum), a lower-class child who longs to find one of the elusive golden tickets. Willy Wonka (played magnificently by Gene Wilder) has hidden 5 golden tickets inside Wonka bars.  The finder of the ticket will be treated to a lifetime supply of chocolate as well as a trip through Wonka's magical factory. Charlie grows more and more distressed as the tickets are found.  Finally, Charlie finds some money lying in the street and purchases 2 Wonka bars.  The second bar contains the elusive 5th golden ticket!  Charlie is allowed to take 1 member of his family along for the trip to the factory.  Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson).  Once inside, the lucky winners are taken on a magical tour of Wonka's factory.  I particularly enjoyed the way the Oompa Loopas gave a moral to each of their stories to help children learn right from wrong.  The numbers dwindle as the tour continues due to misbehaving children.  Finally, only Charlie is left.  At the end, Wonka ""tests"" Charlie by saying that he and Grandpa Joe violated a clause in the agreement they signed, and he uncerimoniously dismisses them.  Charlie gives the gobstopper back to Wonka before leaving.  This was the test; a test of honesty and trustworthiness and Charlie succeeded.  Wonka gives the factory and all of his most precious candy making secrets to Charlie.Morals are taught throughout the film by the actions of the characters. Agustus Gloop falls into the chocolate river and gets stuck in the pipe.  The moral: don't eat too much.  Violet Beauregard turns into a blueberry while chewing a special gum.  The moral: don't eat a lot of sweets.  Veruca Salt falls down a chute while trying to get a golden goose.  The moral: don't whine and continually ask for things. Finally, Mike Teavee gets shrunk by a tv camera.  The moral: don't watch a lot of television.  The Oompa Loompas also teach morals in the puzzles and riddles they share.The special effects in this film are pretty good considering it is 30 years old.  The ""fizzy lifting drinks"" and the ""great glass elevator"" are especially well done.  As a parent, I highly recommend this movie.  Your children (and you as well) will love it!"	5.0	Fun for Children and Adults	2002-08-26	12	7	5

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1ZAYB88YRR93L	JeMicheSunshine	This is the original movie. While Johnny Depp/Tim Burton's movie is good, this one is the first! I love the American story, and Gene Wilder is WILLY WONKA! Heck, HE looks the part and sounds like what you would imagine Willy Wonka would sound like if he was REAL! No disrespect to the British, but I favour the American story best! We live in a world that somehow believes that 'Brit' is best. So, I did not enjoy the 'Britanization' of this American story. It is wonderful to revisit time and time again. And if you have seen this movie as many times as I (& my grown children) have, then you enjoy singing along with all of the songs. My favourite is Sammy Davis' 'Candy Man'...Even though Gene Wilder does his best rendition. Purchase the movie and enjoy it with your family or just for yourself!

If your copy plays, consider yourself lucky.Even with a playable disc however, you find another way Warner screwed up HD-DVDs- this, along with other titles including Enter The Dragon, The Fugitive and Lethal Weapon 2, looks like it was transferred through a screen door! Everything has a blocky look to it- if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. (Amazingly, I've read some positive reviews of this HD-DVD when it first came out, proving that many people wouldn't know what a good picture looked like if it hit them in the face!)I don't know if the Blu-Ray, which came out a bit later, uses the same flawed transfer or not.	2.0	Golden ticket is an HD-DVD that plays!	2011-07-16	3	1	2

I would buy from this vendor again.The movie is just as good as I remember it -- which means it is just as bad as I remember it. The two people who make this movie work are Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka) and Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt). Their performances are outstanding!The first half of the movie is boring. (It was in the movies, when the film was released, too.)The second half of the movie is entertaining.The ending of the movie... is missing. This is not a fault in the DVD... it is a fault in the movie. The film has no meaningful ending: no redemption, no closure. Unlike ""Wizard of Oz"" which sees Dorothy realizing that ""home is where the heart is"", ""Willy Wonka"" leaves us hanging in air along with the wonka-vator.But don't blame the DVD.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3QTP2CI1BDV0M	"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark"""	"There are a lot of things that make ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" a special movie.  The story is wonderful and inspiring, the songs are touching, lighthearted, and fun, and some of the performances are as natural-like and believable as they come.The movie is about kids, and one kid in particular (Charlie Bucket) is the leading character, but Willie Wonka is the star.  Willie Wonka is a famous candy maker and he holds a contest that captures the world's attention.  Mr. Wonka has hidden five ""golden tickets"" in five candy bars (five of the millions of Wonka candy bars sold around the world).  Whoever finds the golden tickets will win a lifetime supply of chocolate PLUS a tour of the fabulous Wonka chocolate factory.The whole world goes Wonka Bar crazy searching for the golden tickets (a lot of fun in the movie) and eventually five children find the tickets.  They and five adults (each kid is allowed to bring one family member) are then given the tour.  The chocolate factory does have its perils, however, and ... one-by-one ... the children are, um, eliminated until only one of them is left.  That kid (Charlie) is then made heir to Willie Wonka's chocolate empire.""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is based on the children's book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl.  Roald Dahl also wrote ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Matilda.""  A creative mind if ever there was one.  His stories are always fun, but they usually have a dark side to them ... and ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is no exception.The songs in ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" were written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley.  Anthony Newley was a rare talent.  He was a good song writer, a popular singer, and a fine actor (Dr. Dolittle).  Here in Willie Wonka the songs fit the varying moods of the movie nicely and are always optimistic.Gene Wilder plays Willie Wonka and ... if ever a man was born to play a part, it was Gene Wilder for Willie Wonka.  His quirky perfectionist personality was perfect for the eccentric perfectionist personality of Willie Wonka.  Peter Ostrum plays Charlie Bucket and he is something special.  Innocent, engaging, and full of boyish charm, he gives ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" its heart ... and sort-of holds the movie together.  Diana Sowle plays Charlie's worn out mother Mrs. Bucket and she is excellent ... excellent in an understated way so that you sort-of have to try to notice her good acting ... and she gives the movie strength and authenticity.Julie Dawn Cole, Denise Nickerson, and Paris Themmen play three of the kids (Veruca, Violet, and Mike) and they are wonderful at being obnoxious little brats ... with Miss Nickerson (as Violet) being my favorite.  Roy Kinnear, Leonard Stone, and Nora Denney play three of the parents and they are a lot of fun ... with Mr. Kinnear (as Veruca's dad) being especially funny.The movie ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was originally conceived as a way to promote a new candy bar ... a real life ""Wonka Bar.""  That's why they changed the name of the story from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" to ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""  The candy bar failed to make it, but this movie has lived on.I have sort-of wondered why ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has remained popular after all these years.  It wasn't a big budget movie.  There were no real stars in it.  The special effects were not outstanding.  And the movie was sort-of thrown together.  Gene Wilder does a marvelous job ... in a subtle sort-of way ... but I think it's the innocence in the movie that saves the day.  This innocence is brought out by Peter Ostrum (as Charlie) and, to a lesser extent, Diana Sowle (as Charlie's mother).  Honesty.  Hard work.  Caring about others. Giving and sacrifice.  All these things are portrayed in the movie so naturally that they almost escape our notice, but they give ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and enduring charm and appeal ... and I think that is why each new generation of children (and adults) have embraced it."	5.0	Fun Movie ... that has remained popular	2006-08-30	3	1	2

What kids' 'live action' classic would be complete without a moment of intensity? Like, the 'Wizard of oz'...it has many moments that people could rage about if they wanted too...the man on fire, the flying 'evil' monkeys, the whole 'witch' thing... The moments of peril that place the people in possible danger only to drop them out on the other side unhurt is the true way to grab a childs' attention. If your child must sleep with a nightlight, then maybe he/she should only watch vegitales. As for me and my family, we are WONKA fiends.

This movie is adapted from Roald Dahls's classic book &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and it truely captures the magic and spirit of the book.  From the beginning of the movie where you can see the Chocolate pouring out (a pure delight), to the end of the movie where Charlie, his grandfather, and Willy Wonka, see a birdseye view of the town, every minute of it is truely charming and captivating.The songs are a delight to sing to once you know them from &quot;The Candy Man&quot; to &quot;I've got A Golden Ticket&quot; to the famous &quot;Oompa Doompa Doopity Doo&quot;, you cant help but sing them over and over again.The sets inside the Chocolate Factory are excellent in detail, especially the room where litterally everything is edible and made of candy.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2M4R0QYKCUGCM	Joey	In a move unusual for Hollywood, the producer of this movie chose the author of the original book, Roald Dahl, as the screenwriter. The result is that the screenplay actually is better than the book, with a great deal of excellent new material and considerable added depth to Charlie's story. No longer is he simply the survivor of a process of elimination without having faced any choices.Very highly recommended over the Johnny Depp version.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A356HRZZFCEGL1	"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos"""	"***This review may contain spoilers.***There's no need for me to reinvent the movie camera and describe in detail (at least I hope) the delectably subversive ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (hereafter ""Wonka"").  Many of the posters here have satisfactorily seen to that, and anyway most people know the plot.  In this review I will comment upon the primary but latent theme of ""Wonka"": the restoration of faith in human nature, specifically childrens' human nature.""Wonka"" is of course superficially cheery, colorful, and buoyant, even in the shabbier scenes where Charlie interacts with his impoverished mother and four grandparents in their hovel.  However, the movie first deftly skewers humanity's greedy inhumanity to man with Willie Wonka's Golden Ticket contest. The movie accurately depicts the scuffles, deceptions, neglect, and hysterical chaos the world's citizens shamefully show to get that ticket.  One supposed winner is later revealed to be fraudulent.  Furthermore, four of the winners are already generally upper-class louts with various vices who each get the ticket in at least slightly shady ways.  Only poor-but-honest Charlie wins the fifth ticket through determined but legitimate means.You might imagine at this point that the sponsor of this contest Wonka is sighing with justified despair at the antics of the world.  It confirms his conclusion that people are just no good.  Still, he is compelled to test people to see if they'll prove him wrong, or just for the slightly sadistic hell of it.  For starters, remember when the reclusive Wonka first emerges from his mysterious factory pretending to be lame, then does a forward flip?  Then almost immediately afterwards Wonka has the kids and their guardians read the factory tour contract with diminishing type on the wall, spelling out what actions (including espionage) will forfeit his candy empire's transfer.  Gulp!  But each of the kids have met the eerily enigmatic Slugworth, Wonka's ""rival"" before the tour.  Will the kids sell out to Slugworth?  And don't forget the psychedelic paddleboat trip with some unsettling images (including chicken beheadings), with Wonka blithely singing a nonsense tune.Of course you know the rest of the story.  Wonka wearily but hilariously says, ""No, stop, come back"", but he doesn't stop the gluttonous kid, the spoiled brat, the gum-obsessed kid with poor manners, and the TV-addict kid from encountering their horrific but fitting punishments.  Even Charlie and his grandpa don't prove saintly.  Against orders, they sample the ""fizzy-lifting drinks"", float to the ceiling, are nearly filleted by the fan, and have to burp to get back down again.  Furthermore, Charlie has pocketed an everlasting gobstopper to sneak away to Slugworth.But Wonka seems to see all.  At the end of the tour, he is ready to escort Charlie and Grandpa Joe out.  When they ask why, he screams at them that they violated the contract provisions with their drink antics and therefore get NOTHING.  Before leaving, Charlie sadly and silently returns the purloined gobstopper.  Immediately, Wonka becomes jubilant.  Why?  Because Charlie proved himself worthy by not betraying Wonka and giving a candy sample to Slugworth, who was a Wonka employee posing as an industrial spy.  It was all a test, and Charlie passed it.  Human beings can be noble and trustworthy after all.Make no mistake, ""Wonka"" is an entertaining fantasy, but it is also a shadowy moralistic one mercilessly pointing out human sins, but rejoicing when one person rises above their sins."	4.0	"The Dark Cynicism of ""Willie Wonka...""

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1AT0GONN4A9NA	"John P. Morgan ""Light Coach"""	"I don't know why it has taken me so longer to review this movie for Amazon. It's only like one of my favorites. I saw this movie with my mother and two sisters' when I was seven years old. I had read the book and I absolutely loved it so I was so excited to see the movie.I was entranced by Gene Wilder. With his crazy hair and his mischievous eyes. Being seven years old, I didn't get all of his sarcastic little comments he makes throughout the movie, but now I fully appreciate his biting wit.The part that got me the most...and still does...is towards the end when the tour is complete and Mr. Wonka just kind of brushes off Charlie and Grandpa Joe. Grandpa Joe and Charlie both look confused about how it all ended so they go into Wonka's office to find out about how they go about getting Charlie's lifetime supply of chocolate.Gene Wilder at this moment was positively frightning the way he came at Grandpa Joe. I remember thinking to myself that he was a crazy man. Then, feeling remorse for what he had done to betray Wonka's trust, Charlie puts the his everlasting gobstopper - a gift from Wonka - on his desk and walks away dejectedly.Wonka was testing Charlie. To see if he really was as good as he appeared to be. He wasn't spoiled, he wasn't a glutton, he didn't have any out of control habits...Charlie was the epitome of an innocent child and Wonka wanted someone innocent and childlike to run his factory after he retires which is why he sent out the golden tickets in the first place.He asks Charlie, ""Do you know what happened to the little boy who wanted it all?""Charlie responds eagerly, ""No, what?""Wonka smiles sweetly, ""He got it...""To this day it chokes me up because that little boy, Charlie, reminded me and still reminds me that being a child is a gift. Adults tend to lose their imaginations. They tend to be easily bought out. They tend to be greedy and competetive and there is no magic in competition, there is no beauty in greed, only with Love and Innocence can True Abundance come forth; the treasures of the Spirit are always ours. This movie is truly a metaphysical gem. The song, 'Pure Imagination' says it best:""If you want to view paradise, simply look around a view it...Anything you want to, do it...Want to change the world?There's nothing to it.There is no place I know that compares to that of my imagination,Living there you'll be freeIf you truly wish to be...""Wow. Okay, I gotta go and wipe the tears out of my eyes now.May we get our fill of Chocolate AND Love...but just remember that to brush your teeth afterwards (before if you're planning to love). :)Peace kiddies..."	5.0	If You Want To View Paradise...Simply Look Around and View It...	2006-08-17	3	2	1
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AIUX1X3GRRBFK	John Waters	Remember the chill of wonder and bewilderment you felt watching the mysterious oompaloompas? I adored this movie as a child and enjoy it even still as an adult!  This is the type of movie our young ones should be watching today, a movie that teaches values and morals while dazzling the younger mind with wonder and imagination....... Unfortunately most of the movies kids watch these days are simply 90 minute commercials to promote toys that are sold based on the movie. It's all about how much money can be made, right?  Willy Wonka is a gem, to be treasured by kids and adults!  I agree that it would be worth it to wait for the widescreen format to be available.  My DVD is actually one of the original releases that was part of the mistaken release by WB.  I bought it off ... for $... and would have paid twice that at the time, when WB hadn't announced the anniversary release. I will definitely purchase the widescreen version in November!	5.0	The type of movie our children should be watching!	2001-09-01	1	0	1

Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka and no one else.  This film had very memorable music that is still in my head despite the fact that I have not seen this movie in a few years.  The Umpa Lumpas in this one were different people and not all the same like in that new release.  Maybe the special effects are not as nice but everything else in this one was better.	5.0	Excellent classic!	2005-12-15	7	4	3
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	Not only do they taste good, but they're fun to look at.Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) has captivated audiences for the last four decades.  I remember this movie would be shown on TV once a year.  It was kind of like The Wizard Of Oz - it was something everyone would look forward to once a year.  This was before there were VCRs and cable television.  How spoiled we all are nowadays.Gene Wilder was brilliantly cast as Willy Wonka.  The sets are outstanding considering this movie came out in '71.My favorite scene in this movie has always been when Violet turns into a blueberry and the Oompas roll her out of the room.  It still makes me laugh to this day.Another one of my favorite scenes is when Charlie and his grandfather are floating up in the room with the fan and the bubbles and they burp their way down.This widescreen edition contains a documentary called Pure Imagination: The Story Of Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, audio commentary from the actors in the movie, four sing-along songs, a Vintage 1971 Featurette, a stills gallery, and the theatrical trailer.This movie's a classic that I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it.	5.0	I love blueberries	2010-08-13	1	1	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AA3EC3LKOBD80	Jonathan Cohen	"Much has been said about ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", and much will be said as the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp remake approaches. So here are a few more words about what I think is the greatest children's book-turned-movie of all...* Why ""Willy Wonka"" instead of ""Charlie""? Turns out that the film's financial backer, Quaker, wanted to go into the candy business and introduce a Wonka bar as a movie tie-in. They should have stayed with cereal because the prototype Wonka bar melted on contact. The movie, however, has proven to be as indestructible as an Everlasting Gobstopper.* Gene Wilder was already established as Mel Brooks' favorite leading man, but his work as Willy Wonka is as distinctive as that gaudy purple coat of his. As the avuncular candy czar with the very warped sense of humor, he still lights up the screen and has those kids eating out of his hand in more ways than one.* The five children were culled from playhouse programs in three countries; Peter Ostrum, so cute and likably innocent as Charlie, came from Cleveland and the same company that once had Paul Newman and Debra Winger on their roster. The most adept of them, I think, is Julie Dawn Cole, so perfectly bratty (and with a biting London accent to boot) as Veruca Salt. It's no surprise to learn that she's the only one of the five that remained a full-time actress.* Did you know that Jean Stapleton almost wound up as Mike Teavee's dotty mom? She was initially offered the part, but at the last minute decided to go with a ""new kind of sitcom"". You know the rest, of course, but Nora ""Dodo"" Denney did a great job as my favorite of the parents.There are tons of little tidbits like these, and you can find them on the excellent supplementary features that are part of this DVD: a well-done documentary that interviews most of the surviving principals; a full-length commentary that reunites all five Wonka kids for the first time in 30 years; and a short clip focusing on the Oscar-winning, Disney-trained set designer, Harper Goff. Very telling, for hard-core Dahl fans, are the comments by David Seltzer, the now-veteran screenwriter whose first major assignment was to rewrite Dahl's original script just before filming began. The softer Wonka, the Slugworth subplot, the parts involving TV newscasters are Seltzer's additions, but the sequence of the kids' introductions and most of the factory scenes remain true to Dahl's work.As you can tell, I've been a serious devotee of both book and film ever since I got a copy of the original ""Charlie"" for my seventh birthday (which I still proudly own). That's why I added these comments rather than rehash the movie itself- you probably know it by heart, too!I don't know anyone who doesn't know this story by heart, so I heartily recommend this excellent package for both devoted fan and neophyte alike. No matter what the Burton/Depp version holds- and given Tim's history of deadpan horror comedy, I'm sure it will be a lot eerier than this one, whose gaudy '60s-style colors somehow don't look dated- there will always be a fond place in the hearts of kids of all ages for the original, and still great, ""Willy Wonka"".Oh, yeah- I ate a candy bar a day, every day, for many years after reading this and never did find that Golden Ticket!"	5.0	STILL WORTH A GOLDEN TICKET!	2005-06-30	10	9	1

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AH9737KI440JL	"Joseph Sparacio ""mondojoe"""	The DVD of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is well worth its price and then some.In addition to the film, there is a short documentary about the making of the film and some other bonuses.  Best of all is the option to view the film with voice over commentary by the now-adult kids who starred in it.  They are very chatty, recall a good deal of detail from filming, and seem to enjoy discussing it.The film itself is engaging and should keep the attention of most younger viewers.  Some adults have expressed their concern that Wonka has a dark or scary tone for a children's movie.  They may be right, but it is not gratuitous, and is necessary to the story.  And while parents may fret about that, I don't yet know of any kids who do.  I loved it as a child, and my children do as well.Gene Wilder is superb as Willie Wonka, delivering a character both charming and menacing.  The other actors, regardless of age, are all fine.  The young actress who plays Veruka Salt is especially good, and at her best in her song (which is a favorite in my family).	5.0	DVD is Worth It	2001-12-30	1	1	0

It really doesn't seem like it's from 1971.  I have probably seen this film over 500 times by now, since the 80's and I still am not the least bit bored of it.  At 28 years old, I still totally love this film!!!  The characters, especially Gene Wilder who plays Willy Wonka, who is THE Willy Wonka, who could never be topped EVER (yes I've seen the 2005 film!), the music, the setting, the songs, and especially the Oompa-Loompa's!  Everything in this film is so wonderfully done and everyone who hasn't seen it yet, needs to as soon as possible!!My favorite place or scene in the whole film has to be the big candy and chocolate room where Willy Wonka sings ""Pure Imagination.""  Not only for the song but because I can see how much work the director put into this film.  All the candy and chocolate looks so real and alive and the whole room looks so beautiful the way everything is set up!  I also love that teacher, Charlie's teacher that you see a lot until they go into the chocolate factory, he is so funny!  And it's set in London, an added bonus!!  I just cannot get enough of this film or recommend this film enough!!  It's a masterpiece!!!  It's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time!!!Who could not love Veruca's ""I Want It Now"" performance?  That whole scene was totally brilliant!The Special Widescreen Edition DVD has tons of extras.  There is commentary by the kids who got to go inside the factory.  You'll also learn that Gene Wilder wouldn't play Willy Wonka unless he was able to do that somersault that he does before letting the kids through the gate.  There is an interview with Gene Wilder from 2001, The Making of Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, four sing along songs, a 1971 behind the scenes featurette, and a photo gallery."	5.0	Oompa-Loompa, doopity do, I've got another puzzle for you!	2005-05-14	127	112	15
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AUBQUV7Y1Y6YH	J. Pearson	I would like to say this film is absolutely a classic. There are some biased fans who prefer this film compared to the more recent Charlie and Chocolate Factory remake. But let's look at from a critical point of view.The remake is closer to the book but that does not always mean a better plot and details. Yes this version goes off the book a bit but it brings out a better plot for children. During the 70's there wasn't the best film equipment and there are a few goof's in the version but they are mainly looked over. This version has more imagination for the younger children but also brings adults back to their childhood years in thought. The remake doesn't really stick into your mind and there is creative music in this version.In todays world most people are very stuck to high technology and progressivism. This version doesn't deal with those kinds of ideals. That is why it stays more as a classic. It mainly points out that if you are good you will possible get the grand prize.Pro's of this Film1. This is more musical and the songs are very catchy and addictive.2. This kind of film reminds people of their childhood.3. This version is more about pleasure and happiness. The remake isn't that focused on those qualities but more on just making the book as nsync with the film.4. Extremely colorful and musical mixed. But it will depend on what kind of music you enjoy.Con's1. The movie is quite addictive and uses up lots of wasted time when watching over and over and over2. Not extremely in line with the book too much but that depends on what you want to watch. A creative movie or a complete copy of the book? That's your choice3. Some goofs in filming. But mostly if you haven't watched it over and over you won't notice it.You must be your own judge. I really prefer this movie because it reminds me of my childhood that I missed out on because of me being stuck away in hospitals most of my childhood. I must live as an adult in a society that always demands maturity. This film allows me to escape reality of todays world and enjoy the innocence. The music at times even brings tears to my eyes especially Pure Imagination. But you must be your own judge. If you want creative side, music, childhood innocence, happiness, and no seriousness then choose this version. If you want a movie completely nsync with the book, a bit dark side, modernism, and technology, a movie that won't stick to your mind then the remake might be right for you. But you be the judge.Simplify this is one of my most favorite movies of all time but everyone is different and must choose. For children I suggest this one.	5.0	Excellent: Comparing the Good from the Bad	2006-02-01	4	4	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AWJH9ECKBR1YC	"JR ""JR"""	This movie is about a third generation loser that defies odds to inherit a factory downtown and become a chocolatier. Charlie as he is called, is flanked by the opportunistic Gandpa Joe who has spent twenty years in bed before literally leaping at an opportunity to tour the factory of a local recluse candy manufacturer (Willy Wonka) with his grandson. Willy Wonka concocts as series of sadistic tests to weed through the list of invited children before finally choosing Charlie. In the end Charlie must choose his path but what what will it be?This film irritated me on many levels. The biggest irritation was how Charlies mother worked her fingers to the bone to support her mother, father, in-laws and bastard son all while Grandpa Joe laid in bed ill for twenty years. Suddenly when an opportunity comes his way he is back on his feet. The sheer laziness of that family is sickening. I could not watch this again.	2.0	Irritating.	2010-03-19	31	3	28

No, not an eye-blowing blu transfer, but I found it to be a most pleasant watch anyway (should you need a drastic comparison, watch the trailer first!). And a note RE: an earlier comment: once the credits finish (in smaller window), the wide-screen image commences. It is a Warner Bros. release, with same extra features as earlier dvd (30 min 'making of', vintage featurette, sing-alongs). Also has myriad of language options (AUDIO: eng hd,fra,deu,ita,spa,port, wonka kids commentary; SUBTITLES: to audio languages, add fin,nld,dan, nor,swe). Love this film: the humor, humanity, family portrayals (+/-), childhood innocence, redemption. . . and am absolutely convinced it would not make it for today's movie-going appetite: it is just too 'good', and most folk don't seem to be interested in that anymore.

If you've been a fan of Willy Wonka with similar circumstances as myself, then you too will find the HD DVD version a bit bigger, a bit sweeter and a bit more marvelous in 1.85:1 than you might remember from its annual 4:3 television presentations. The presentation is enough to make some of it feel new.As for the HD transfer, I'll admit that it's not what I was hoping for, nor am I disappointed - when Charlie looks through the fence at the factory in the distance there's a bit of noise in the sky - though it does look decent for its era. The stitching on Willy Wonka's coat is nice and sharp. When I zoom in to 2x I am able to see a bit of a jagged edge that I don't see while zoomed in on other old films.A second viewing with the Wonka kinds' commentary turned on is definitely worth doing, as it offers some additional historical insight - I found it quite interesting.This is a classic movie enjoying a nice HD transfer, only slightly showing its age.

Then again, this is a film based omplomas and everlasting lollies, hence we  can hardly look for realism in Willy Wonka's factory.I think this film  is valuable for all ages, and I know I will continue to enjoy it thirty  years on. I like the fact that it promotes dreaming, it steps beyond the  limited bounds of adult reality, and into the hopeful wide eyed closed  gates of Wonka land.It is also very narrative on the part of the songs  of the little men. Although I never quite understood how a little boy who  eats too much fit in with a guy who talked to much, a selfish girl and a  hygiene void girl. And he was the one to get killed off first? How was he  worse than the girl who wanted everything? Oh well, learn not to question  the almighty powers of the Wonka.	5.0	Charming film....a classic for all ages.	2000-03-24	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2OG7XE23X5UM2	"KC ""KC"""	"I watched this with my husband (who for some reason enjoys this film) again and I still don't know WHY it is so beloved.  I mean...the film ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (based, like this film, on a classic children's book) is almost forgotten and they're pretty much the same as far as entertainment value, writing, etc.  I guess it must be the fact that Gene Wilder is in this, or maybe it's that LSD trip scene with the B-horror movie stock footage inserted - I have no idea.I actually first saw this on its initial screen release back in the early/mid 70's - ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was one of my favorite books and so of course I was eager to see the film.  What a disappointment it was to me then.  Now it's just distasteful, boring, with shoddy production values.(My husband says ""but it's a FANTASY"" - he never did read the book...)Charlie's family - this is supposed to be taking place in the 1960's/1970's, yet Charlie's mom is supporting the family by taking in washing which she boils in a tub - the way wash was done back in the 19th century.  In fact, the Bucket family lives pretty much in the 19th century - the only respite for Charlie is when he goes to school and into 'modern times'.  In the book, Charlie also has a dad who lost his job at the toothpaste factory.  Grandpa Joe seems to know a lot about Wonka - could he have been one of the workers who lost his job when Wonka closed the factory and brought in the free labor of the Oompa-Loompas, most likely sending the town into unemployment and depression?  Hmm.The Golden Ticket search - doesn't it strike you as funny that ""Slugworth"" and the news film crews were always on the scene the moment the tickets were found?  Sounds like a setup to me.  I think Wonka had his eye on Charlie as a successor from the getgo (I mean he DID live in the same town as the Wonka factory) but thought it would be a good idea to have the contest.  Think of how much money he made in the sale of candy worldwide - Wonka probably needed the extra bucks to finance his crazy schemes such as sending a bar of chocolate through TV.  And speaking of inventions - those Everlasting Gobstoppers that a person could suck on forever - how the heck are you supposed to put those things in your mouth?  I guess the filmmakers thought just making something that resembled a jawbreaker would be too pedestrian...?And the first room - the Chocolate Room.  As another reviewer here has noted, the 'chocolate waterfall' isn't at all like what I'd imagined (based not only on the book, but having toured the Hershey factory as a kid and seeing the 'conching' pools).  Rather than thick, rich, creamy chocolate, Wonka's 'chocolate river' is more reminicent of, say, untreated water from a sewage plant.  (blegh!)The acid trip scene has already been picked apart and discussed so many times that all I'm going to say is it looks as though the producers/directors of this film were trying to cut corners by using stock film footage of decapitating chickens and what have you.  Easily the most tasteless and unnecessary scene in the film.The songs - insipid, uninspired, and most of them are just plain BAD, especially when you compare the Oompa-loompa verses in the book to the lyrics of the songs in the film.  (hopefully the new version coming out next year will use the words that Mr. Dahl used in his book.)  And the Oompa-Loompas - I hesitate to even mention them...just ridiculous and they don't seem to be 'living in happiness' at all.  Of course, in the film they're slave labor living captive in the Wonka factory...What was it about the 70's and kid's films anyway?  This would be suitable on a double bill with the 1969 version of ""Pippi Longstocking"" as both are badly made films purported to be made for children, based on beloved children's books, but turned out to be like train wrecks - you don't WANT to watch but their very badness just compels one to do so."	2.0	Train wreck of a movie...its popularity puzzles me...?	2004-12-25	50	15	35

They loved the boat ride in particular, which I found rather funny considering all the controversy I see in other reviews about the beheaded chicken (which appears to me to be already dead), and the worm inching across a face (which doesn't seem dead).So, I asked them what they liked about it, upon seeing the movie a second time.  The five year old (funnily enough) said that it told her that nothing about the movie was what it seemed and it made her pay attention more (my paraphrasing).  The six year old simply said it was cool.Fast forward 20 years.  They're still paying attention to life around them like they were paying attention to the movie years ago, and treating nothing as what it initially seems.  They're extremely successful in their endeavors (right now it's college).  I have wonder if this boatride scene in this movie didn't have something to do with that.	5.0	great movie, one to show to the kids	2002-11-16	2	0	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1XXBVRRNGBG5Y	kendall lopere	News that everyone's favorite creator of children's fairy tales, Tim Burton, is to remake this classic story by everyone's favorite children's author, Roald Dahl, will necessarily focus attention back to this original version.  This film is a magnificent visual treat.  Set in a fantasy parallel universe of Dickensian poverty and Wellsian Sci-Fi the film still entertains today with it's psychedelic visuals, off-the-wall humor and rags-to-riches, American-dream-come-true story.  It is easy to get caught up in the excitement of the hunt for the Golden Tickets, the disappointment felt by Charlie, whose place on the lowest rung of the social ladder means that he is too poor to participate in the madness unless he forsakes the welfare of his own family living 4-in-a-bed in their shack in order to follow his own selfish dreams (a telling and timely indictment of modern day capitalism and the shallowness and selfishness of the modern American teenager), the miraculous healing of Charlie's grandfather by the Golden Ticket, and the empathy inspired in us for the characters is truly the sign of a great film.The futuristic machines and products dazzle, the freakish Oompah-Loompahs are as compelling today as ever (there seems to be a current resurgence of interest in little-people e.g. Elf, Bad Santa, Jackass to name but a few...) and it's hard to shake the feeling that The Chocolate Factory is everything that Disneyland should be but isn't.On a more somber note Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka sent shivers down my spine when I rewatched this. Our view of Wonka's character today is sadly tainted by child abuse scandals, and it's hard not to see something of Michael Jackson in the idea of the man who never grew up, who vigorously eschews and distrusts adult company and who plays dangerous mindgames with the children he lures into his playground.  Call me cynical or overly politically correct, but I just think that side of Wonka could be better dealt with in a new version, and hopefully dealt with differently.That said it still is a great movie for kids, scary in parts (e.g. The boat journey down the chocolate river into the tunnel) but ultimately a rewarding and moral story about the importance of being nice, selfless and earnest and the hope that one day maybe, just maybe, it could happen to you.  This is the savage, beating heart of the American Dream. Long may it live on....	4.0	Timeless Children's Classic	2003-12-27	9	3	6
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A13EUSV15UDAUG	"kennedy19 ""kennedy19"""	"Most people who dislike this film do so because they don't like the storyline, with its ""sadistic"" punishments of bad kids in a mysterious candy factory. I criticize it on slightly different grounds: the story is fine, but this film falls very far short of the book (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl) upon which it is based. Somehow this cheap, watery waterfall of chocolate (not appetizing like the thick one in the book), midgets in brownface, subdued performance by the great Gene Wilder, and pedestrian special effects can't conjure the truly exciting magic that anyone who has read the book (PLEASE read the book) will know about. The story in a nutshell involves a poor boy who learns of a contest to find golden tickets in candy bars. Only five tickets exist, and these allow the lucky winner to go on a tour of Willy Wonka's famous candy factory, the most magical one in the world. Most of the winners are obnoxious brats who get their comeuppance through their own faults. I won't say what becomes of our hero, Charlie. This movie more or less sticks to the plot of the book, but it adds an extra villain, a rival candy-maker. The songs are mostly forgettable, though the Oompa Loompah song is pretty good. Those who complain that the film is ""scary"" are referring to a very odd scene in which Wonka takes kids on a boat ride that inexplicably turns into what can only be described as a nightmarish acid flashback; one wonders what the director was on. Is the overall story a good and engaging one? You bet it is, but the film version just doesn't cut it for me. The book was simply too good. You are cheating yourself if you watch the movie. It's like eating chocolate with water in it."	3.0	So-so version of a classic	2003-06-10	17	5	12

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2MH0QDRZFWF2S	Kenton Larsen	"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, according to director Mel Stuart in his book ""Pure Imagination,"" was bankrolled by Quaker Oats to provide children with ""quality"" entertainment, presumably as long as that quality entertainment sold its upcoming chocolate bar.Director Mel Stuart's film is, indeed, one of the best ""quality"" children's movies ever made, though it's so subversive at times, it's doubtful that this could be what Quaker Oats had in mind when it handed over the money.Don't get me wrong: the movie is a children's film in some of the usual senses of the term. There's an incredible chocolate factory that will have kids wishing they were there, and musical numbers entertain along the way as we learn valuable lessons about the dangers of greed, gluttony, and watching too much TV.But there it is, right in the middle of the film and directly out of left field, the scene that plays like a bad drug trip, in which Willy Wonka (who truly is played to perfection by the brilliantly deadpan Gene Wilder) captains a boat down the chocolate river and an array of multi-colored lights and random images flash on the walls as the boat goes faster...faster...faster...to the horror of everyone onboard. These images include a worm crawling across a person's face and a chicken coming into contact with the business end of a cleaver (no blood, but still...chocolates, anyone?). Then again, it's probably more effective then the ""Just Say No"" campaign ever was.If this sounds all too disturbing, it's debatable, and likely depends on the kid; the darker parts of the film are few and far between and all part of what makes this it so memorable and so unlike any other. Adults will love the sarcastic humor and most children will love the chocolate factory - scary boat ride and all.As for Mel Stuart's book, ""Pure Imagination:"" it's an interesting read with some behind-the-scenes pix and info - but to the die-hard fan it comes off as a little light on details and heavy on hardcover, the better to increase the price.By the way, Stuart says that Quaker Oats never did produce the chocolate bar tie-in it had intended; for some reason, it could never get the recipe right, which I guess makes it the first movie product tie-in that wasn't."	5.0	The best, and most subversive, kids' film of all time	2002-01-27	16	13	3

Yes its a kids movie but i think adults will enjoy it as well, no swearing, sex or violence. jack albertson is the boys grand father who gos along with charlie (He finally got a gold ticket) on a wonderfull magical tour of the candy factory, and of course thats where they meet the oompa loompas.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1FIC2H5HU5MRM	KHoffman	I compared my BD version to the first 1999 SD DVD. The 1999 DVD is in an open-matte, full frame version which shows more of the top and bottom of the film. The BD version is in Hi-Def, but looks &#34;zoomed-in&#34; in height compared to the '99 DVD but somehow has more film information exposed on the sides of the screen than the DVD, which is interesting, The raw frame ratio must be somewhat odd to account for this.	5.0	Needs an HD version for the Open Matte Version Too	2014-04-27	0	0	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	The fantastic works of Roald Dahl present several amazing stories such as The Vicar of Nibbleswicke, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and James and the Giant Peach.  Many of his works have turned into films including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that received the film title Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.  This year many viewers will also be able to see Tim Burton's adaptation of Dahl's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and he should have no problem capturing the dark elements of Dahl's creations, since he has proven himself several times through directing fascinating and captivating fairy tales such as Big Fish (2003) and Edward Scissorhands (1990).  However, this review is not in regards to the upcoming film, but rather the first film about Willy Wonka.The version made by Mel Stuart in 1971 where Gene Wilder performs the role as Willy Wonka offers a fantasy journey through song and music while capturing the ominous atmosphere of Dahl's work.  The story focuses on Charlie (Peter Ostrum), a selfless and thoughtful kid, who would rather share the little he has than keep it for himself.  At home Charlie's mom works hard doing other people's laundry while taking care of his four bedridden grandparents including Grandpa Joe.  Besides attending school Charlie also has a job as a paperboy and he shares his meager income with his poor family members.  It is a hard life for him and his family, but they get by as their kindness to one another makes the hardships tolerable.In Charlie's home town there is a chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka.  People in the town are creating their own mysterious myths in regards to the chocolate factory, but one thing is for sure, these myths base on the fact that no one has ever seen anyone enter or exit the factory including Willy Wonka whose identity is still unknown.  However, it appears that Willy Wonka has decided that he will invite five strangers that get a golden ticket from a chocolate bar that they buy.  This seems like a brilliant marketing ploy, as the mystery around Wonka creates a frenzy for Wonka chocolate bars.The people of the world begin their quest for chocolate bars, as they desire the few available tickets that would lead them into the secrets of the Willy Wonka chocolate factory.  Five children find the tickets, as some of the children display some undesirable traits such as gluttony, sloth, greed, envy, and pride.  Even the names of the characters offer a hint towards what deadly sin they are leaning toward, as their name refers to the action that creates the unwanted train.  For example, for gluttony you have Gloop, Teevee (that should be read: TV) for sloth, and the more interesting Salt for greed as salt once was considered to have much value to all people.Ultimately, all of the five children with an accompanying family member get to meet Willy Wonka who brings them into the magical kingdom of his chocolate factory.  Through the journey the children's negative traits begin to show, and eventually take control of each child to which the audience gets to hear the wonderful Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do song.  Each time the audience hears the song a new lesson is taught in regards to good manners and what impact they can have on the persons life.  This song is truly a highlight of the film, as the Oompa Loompas characters sing and dance.Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Facotry is a wonderful film for both children and grown-ups, as both can learn the lessons of a good upbringing.  The story becomes more intriguing through its colorful and fantasy-like mise-en-scene, which Mel Stuart cleverly captures in the well framed film.  Gene Wilder also provides an enigmatic performance with clownish moments that enhance the fun for all viewers.  Also, the script and musical elements push the story into a lighthearted, yet ingeniously thoughtful portrayal.  When it all comes to an end the audience will have laughed, felt suspense, and had something to ponder through the many lessons that the film offers.	4.0	Thoughtfully Amazing Fantasy Journey...	2005-05-28	2	1	1

Unlike Tim Burton's darker version- Willy Wonka is cherrier with colorful characters and faces... Willy Wonka played by Gene Wilder is SUPERB he gives a delicious performance as the lonely candymaker...everything from his eye movements to his character's lines is Wonka ""I can hardly stand the excitement"" when Augustus is stuck in the pipe. He seems to hate children- yet want to like them. Making you feel like Wonka is a truly conflicted character such as he is in the book. In looks and manners Wilder IS Wonka. His ""Pure Imagination"" song is a song- that I wish the world would listen too... ""If you want to view paradise simply look around and view it... want to change the world... there's nothing too it"" is a true statement that echoes in the movie.Young Charlie is brillant and makes this movie what it is...With a great cast, colorful set, and classic catchy showtunes this movie is a delight for the senses and true treat for old an young.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"With the upcoming Tim Burton remake soon to be released, watching the classic 1971 original, I can't help thinking that Johnny Depp has got his work cut out for him, stepping into Gene Wilder's intimidating shoes. This timeless gem of a movie tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a down-on-luck kid who buys a Wonka candy bar with a golden ticket inside that allows him entrance to the fantastical Wonka chocolate factory and the mysterious eccentric, Willy Wonka. Roald Dahl is an author many adults find unsettling. They abhor the idea of their children's elucidation of books in which the grown-ups are so consistently portrayed as stupid, malevolent, and out of touch with the really important things in life. His earlier work is a lot less unsympathetic, but the attitude is basically the same: most people are cruel idiots, and the exceptional few who are not are justified in doing what they like to the many who are. Not a pleasant point of view, but it makes for some remarkable stories, which place the eccentric characters above the ""normal"" ones. The film itself however is a real treat. And thankfully it retains it's magic regardless of age. Those who dismiss it as candy-colored fluff miss the point. This is pure escapism with two large helpings of multi-flavored fun. Just like Wonka says ""A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest of men'. After 20 odd years, this is still one of my all-time favorite movies. Arthur Ibbetson's wonderful cinematography captures the essence of Dahl's best book perfectly. And who could forget the amazing candy land visuals, the ultra- catchy oompa-loompa songs and brilliant storytelling magic? Willy Wonka is a classic that will be remembered forever."	5.0	Big shoes to fill for Johnny Depp	2005-07-08	2	2	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1CXVAOCM2IN5Q	Kurt Miller	"This is a Great DVD!  My 3 year-old daughter loves this movie even more than the Wizard of Oz.Gene Wilder is spectacular as the ""Greatest Magician of them all--Mr. Willy Wonka!""  His ability to shift moods at the flick of cane twirl really makes the movie.  Part mad-scientist, part imaginative child, and part philanthropist, Wilder is funny, frightening, warm, and even pitiable when he needs to be.The idea of a magic world behind the gates of a chocolate factory will always hold meaning for imaginative children, who aren't constrained by the knowledge big business and corporate profiteering.The Oompa Loompas, by the way, have a real show-stealing nack.  Their dance routines and lectures via song, are my daughter's favorite scenes.  She can do most of their routines, and has memorized their lyrics.Of course, there is also a very nice story of the first being last and the last being first, and of the gentle inheriting the earth.  So despite a slight amount of 1970's baggage (e.g., all the children are caucasian)the film's message is very admirable.A question I would like to know the answer to is, how much the author of ""Charlie & and the Chocolate Factory"" owes to Dr. Seuss, as it appears there a many Seussian homages in the film?A bigger question I have is why this wonderful movie hasn't had more of a Wizard of Oz sort of treatment?  While the Wizard of Oz is shown at least once a year, I never see Willy Wonka on TV.  I also haven't been able to find any Willy Wonka toys for my daughter.  That is one of the reasons it seemed important to have the DVD in our video library."	5.0	But I Want An Oompa Loompa Now!	2002-11-29	3	1	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1D8FXMKOLTL7A	Lalalalaura	There's kind of two separate movies in here -- the part everyone remembers is the fun part after they get to the chocolate factory, but you have to remember that it can take forever to get there.  A friend of mine who had very fond memories of this movie tried to show it to his younger brother, but it wasn't such a success because, as he said &quot;I forgot about all that boring plot at the beginning.&quot;  That's not to say you shouldn't watch it, or try to get kids to watch it, but be prepared that it doesn't just dive straight into the good part.Once it gets to the chocolate factory, of course, it's so much fun to watch.  Roald Dahl gets most of the credit, of course, for thinking up such wonderful things, but the filmmakers -- director, set designers, etc -- deserve a lot of credit also for actually doing it right.  I'd actually love to watch it with a little kid who hadn't seen it before, but they showed it in the film series when I was at college and that was a lot of fun, too.	4.0	gets good after a while	2001-10-09	4	3	1
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AT061G4F480TI	Lance Ehlers	Very cool widescreen DVD of the classic film. The commentary track is excellent (ex: Peter Ostrum talking about how when his kids saw the film, they asked him why the filmmakers had made him wear a 'wig'-- it's the poor kid's real friggin' hair).The documentary is also worth investigating. The 'Oompa Loompa' who's interviewed is all tanned & decked out in gold jewelry. I'm tellin' ya', he's so sexed out, he could probably lay a line on me and pick me up. Hey, and speaking of sexed up, raise your hand if -- like me-- you found as a kid that there was something intangibly curious about Veruca Salt.This film remains the most deliciously subversive, nightmarishly odd bit of entertainment ever created for an under 13 demographic. The flying monkeys ain't got diddly on the stuff in this film. And I don't mean to say that children should not see this. As the director says in the documentary, kids are very sharp and very hip. And they understand the film. Kids need limits. They need to understand that there are consequences for breaking rules. They need to understand that a person needs to be responsible for the choices he or she makes.This film is a classic because it is smart, imaginative, totally whacked, and never condescending. Mark my words: in another 30 years, after all the Pokemon films have crumbled to dust in the discount bins, your kids' kids will be watching this film.If you were disappointed with previous editions of the film, this is the version to get.	5.0	Flying monkeys ain't got diddly on this subversive classic.	2003-07-21	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1N643TZ48RPG7	Leonard Snerdley	"I love movies.  I love them a lot.  When my friends ask me about the best films to show their children, I respond with the classics: ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Mac and Me"", ""D.A.R.Y.L."", ""Flight of the Navigator"", ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"", ""The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again"" and ""Baby Geniuses"".  All are genuine classics with nothing subversive on their mind, except for fun, which is not subversive.  Inevitably, someone will ask about this film, to which I always reply, ""What?!  Are you kidding??!!""Somewhere along the line, it was decided that this was an ideal children's movie.  I'm not sure why; perhaps it was the presence of children and candy.  Perhaps the character of Willy Wonka reminded us of late Halloween nights munching on Wonka classics like Nerds, Pop Rocks, Gobstoppers and Almond Joys.  But any logical person viewing this film will see it as a cruel, mean-spirited, feature-length advertisement with nothing more on its mind than bumping off kids in progressively gruesome ways.If you're a parent, think twice before screening this film.  Think about what's more vital to show a kid: kids dying and eating lots of sweets (this movie), or robot children finding families that love them (as in ""D.A.R.Y.L."").  Or heck, even the sweet beauty of little Michael bonding with MAC in the timeless ""Mac and Me"".Save your money and your time.  There's nothing in this candy bar but nougat and cruelty."	1.0	Wholly unsuitable	2004-11-23	80	10	70
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1430KYDJIY6GU	"Les ""ie1ljs"""	"Having seen both versions several times I have to say I like both. Yes there are stark differences in the main character Willy Wonka and there were some other minor differences in the characters of the children and their parents. Actually, there are a great many differences between Tim Burton's version and the original Mel Stuart version. Mel Stuart's version was more like a musical, highlighted with several musical interludes presented by Gene Wilder and his portrayal of Willie Wonka and one other musical interlude given by the character Varuca Salt - the ""I want it now"" song. Both versions had Oompah-Loompah songs - after all, it wouldn't be the same without the Oompah Loompah's musical mantras touting the social problems of misbehaved, spoiled children. I did, however, prefer the original Oompah-Loompah performances. The lead up story, basically Charlie's story, for the most part is unaltered with Burton's version deviating slightly to include Charlie's father, a man who works at a toothpaste factory, and his mother is non-working to stay at home and take care of the ramshackle hut of a house and Charlie's grandparents. In the original, we do not know of Charlie's father and his mother works at a laundry, washing clothes. Tim Burton's remake also does not include ""The Candy Man"" song or Charlie's theme ""Cheer up Charlie"". There is one other song when Charlie's grandfather get's out of bed for the first time in twenty years. It's not in Burton's version either. In contrast, the only ""musical"" interlude in Burton's version aside from the Oompah-Loompah songs was a cheesy ""Willie Wonka"" mechanical doll performance at the entry to the Wonka Factory. This performance while starting out innocently enough soon transcends in to a scene more apropos for a ""Chucky"" film - hideous and revolting!Over all I give both versions equal ratings. In the following I discuss in general the differences I noticed and meant the most to me. If you for some odd reason have not seen either movie and wish not to know the details then please read no further. They have certainly been on TV several times.The parallels:Augustus Gloop, the gluttonous brat: No differences between the two versions.Violet Bueregard, the gum chewing brat: In both versions she takes the gum from Wonka and, at the behest of Wonka not to, begins to chew the gum. The 2 movies do deviate at the point only slightly where as Wilder's Wonka does, in a more nonchalant manner, say ""stop, don't"", Depp's Wonka simply bemoans where the process goes wrong. In both versions, Voilet turns violet and becomes very, very round and plump, like a blueberry, only in Burton's version, more so. The end is the same- to be rushed off to the blueberry squeezing room!Varuca Salt, the spoiled rotten brat who gets anything she wants: All through the movie (both versions) she demands her father to buy her this or get her that. The difference here is that in the original she sees giant geese that lay giant golden eggs - for Easter, of course. In Burton's version, and as I understand from the original book, there are squirrels - who test and shell walnuts. Of course, Varuca demands her father to buy her a squirrel, or in the case of the original, a goose. In either version she attempts to steal her prize and ends up going down the garbage chute to the ""incinerator"". Which we find out isn't working that day - whew, thank goodness for that ;).Mike Teevee, the brat with a television addiction: The same annoying ""know it all"" brat. The difference being that in the original he was addicted to westerns and in Burton's version he is a video-game addict. I liked the way in which both Wonka characters dealt with Mike through the course of the movie. The end for Mike was the same in both versions.The major differences (aside from the musical score and the characterization of the Oompa- Loompas);Willy Wonka: The eccentric chocolate mogul. There are stark differences between Mel Stuart's version and Tim Burton's version.Mel Stuart's Version of Wonka portrayed by Gene Wilder is a light hearted, whimsical and somewhat eccentric man where as Tim Burton's version portrayed by Johnnie Depp is a considerably darker character who has deep emotional evulsions toward parents - linked to an apparently overbearing father who was a dentist, as we are repeatedly shown in no less than 3 ""flashback"" scenes. Depp's Wonka was definitely eccentric. His portrayal, however, stopped well short of whimsical and was in no way light hearted, but rather more stogy with a slight after taste of stale comedy.Then finally to Charlie Bucket: The poor and destitute ""good"" child. Here, the story isn't quite the same, either. The differences are many; I'll touch on the most notable.In the original, there is no father figure. Charlie is closest to his grandfather, who hadn't stepped foot out of bed in 20 years. In Burton's version, Charlie has a father figure who had just been laid-off at the ""toothpaste"" factory, his job being replaced by a robot. In both versions, however, Charlie does go to the chocolate factory with his grandfather.In the original, Charlie and his grandfather DO get in to mischief by taking a sip of some ""Fizzy Lifting Soda"" and end up floating up in to a, for lack of better description, smokestack. They do return to ground unharmed and continue on with their adventure - after all, the story is about Charlie. In the remake, no such detours. Charlie was a perfect child all the way through. In the original, Charlie did not initially win. He had to prove his ""goodness"" by returning the ""Everlasting Gobstopper"" at the end of the adventure. At which point Wilder's Wonka awarded Charlie the factory; End of movie. In Burton's version, Depp's Wonka, since Charlie is the last remaining child, the factory is awarded to him, BUT, unlike the original, Wonka tells Charlie his family can't come with him. The movie languishes on with Charlie actually showing Depp's Wonka that having a family is a good thing and eventually Charlie wins out, reuniting Depp's Wonka with his father and then obtaining the factory and moving his family in as well. There is hardly a mention of the ""Everlasting Gobstopper"" in Burton's version. There was a ""sub plot"" in the original version that centered around honesty. Wonka's chief competitor was Slugworth Candies. A man posing as Slugworth approaches each child offering him/her cash fortune to get an ""Everlasting Gobstopper"". A tempting trial for each child, no doubt. While this sub-plot does make an appearance in the Burton version, it ends up fading away never to be seen again. In Stuart's version, this sub plot would be the deciding point for Charlie, had he not returned the Gobstopper to Wonka, he would not have won the ""prize"". This sub plot proves honesty above all else.Let's not forget the flyover in the glass elevator. While minor to the movie, it should be noted that in the original we never see the end result of the children who lose out. This would be the end of Stuart's version as Charlie, grandpa, and Wonka fly onward and the credits roll.In Burton's remake, we get to see each of children as they exit the factory in a cartoonish portrayal of what each child went through.Augustus covered in dried chocolate - attempting to eat the chocolate from his fingersViolet, still violet in color is now more flexible, but otherwise unharmed and apparently enjoying her new found flexibility.Varuca and her father exit covered in trash. Varuca spots the flying glass elevator and quips, obviously not learning her lesson, ""Daddy, I must have a glass elevator!"" This time, however, Mr. Salt retorts quite shortly ""the only thing you're getting is a bath!""Mike Teevee, having been shrunk in the Wonka-vision is now considerably taller and very, very thin; having been stretched in the taffy pulling machine.Then we see the glass elevator crash through the roof of Charlie's house where Depp's Wonka delivers the prize to Charlie. Telling him he has won the factory, but then dashing his hopes by telling him his family can't come along. No, sadly, this is not the end of the movie as it languishes on. We see later Charlie working a shoe-shine stand and Wonka sitting, pretending to read a news paper, taunting Charlie about his decision and wondering why such a smart child would want his parents around. This continues with Charlie convincing Wonka to find his father, Wilber Wonka DDS. They do, they meet, the Wonka's engage in a rather reserved father/son embrace. We then see Charlie and Willie returning to Charlie's house for dinner - but this time, the house is actually IN the factory. Wonka did give the factory to Charlie AND allowed Charlies entire family move in.I did prefer Stuart's version of the Oompah-Loompahs. Burton's version seemed like a cloning production in overdrive. All looking exactly the same. Which, in reality it was. In Burton's version, Gordeep (Deep) Roy played ALL of the Oompah Loompahs - with a little help from technology, of course.All that said, I have not read Dahls original novel. I have read the introduction for the screenplay, however. The Intro scenes of Burton's version do, for the most part, follow the Dahl intro. From the point of the children gathering at the gates of the Wonka Factory and forward, I can't say. Perhaps I will have to obtain a copy of the novel and find out."	4.0	Overdue review by an impartial viewer	2008-12-26	1	1	0

To be in a room where everything is edible. It also teaches a lesson to children to be nice and caring to others instead of being greedy and selfish brats.  Gene Wilder would have to be the best ever person to play the part of Willy Wonka.  He has that unique quality about him that just makes the movie more interesting.  I have two copies of the movie, the 25th and the 30th anniversary(which is in mint condition). I would recommed this movie to anyone.

I loved the book, I loved the movie when I was little, and I still love it. It has so many parts that a little kid could never understand. Gene Wilder is brilliant as Willy Wonka, creating a Wonka who is very intelligent, slightly insane, and somewhat scary at times. All in all, it is a clever combination of satire and Roald Dahl's story which is enjoyable for everyone.	5.0	Willy Wonka is SO good!	2001-08-29	0	0	0

Though this movie version does not follow the book precisely, it still seems true to Roald Dahl's vision of how the story should be shown.The young actors in this movie are talented, and show a wonderful ability to portray the traits of their characters perfectly.  Gene Wilder is perfect as Willy Wonka, able to show the wild emotions of the character in a way that is both accurate to the book's version of the character and that is hilarious.I would recommend this movie for both kids and adults, who will both find something special about it.	5.0	Wonderful movie!	2003-05-27	2	2	0

A true classic - not just for children, but for adults.Spoiled brats, greedy children, and overindulgent parents  share the screen with Charlie, who is the star of this film, and Willy Wonka, the millionaire chocolate factory owner.  Gene Wilder is hilarious in his role as the goofy and slightly deranged Wonka, who obviously has no idea how to interact with adults, nevertheless spoiled children.  Each time a child disappears in his factory, Mr. Wonka simply moves on to the next attraction.Funny and sentimental, this film will have you singing along to the many songs.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2W00XKTTF1G0Z	"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa..."	Willy Wonka  &amp; The Chocolate Factory is a classic. Why? Not only was it makes ion the whim of a child and financed by oatmeal company but it survived the most important test of all - time. It has music, warmth and magic.The ensemble of children - including Charlie, was very well cast. The energy and enthusiasm of what their plight is made each one of them funny, obnoxious and charming. Their respective parents can be identified in your everyday life as `real' parents. Even the songs like `The Candy Man', `Cheer Up Charlie' and `I Want It Now' make you smile, cheer and sing along. Who could ever forget the Oompa Lumpa songs too?The sets were fantastic. Colorful and detailed is what everything on the set was made to be. From the moment the title role...to the blasting out of the Wonkavator at the end - you are left with a warm heart, good feelings and the extreme desire to eat chocolate. (Recently the movie `Chocolate' did that to me.) The costumes and location and sets were all timeless and the movie works well even 35 years later.The DVD extras include a clever menu that guides through the various scenes, languages and captions that this film was dubbed in. There is a `making of' documentary that was produced in the 70's and there is one produced last year (2001). They both are insightful and funny and complete with behind the scenes footage of the making of the very unique and detailed sequences that make the Magic of Willie Wonka so wonderful.I've saved the best comment for last. Mr. Gene Wilder is a genius. His acting and performance as Willie Wonka was one that I can even any other actor in history doing. He is so interesting and exciting and unpredictable that watching him makes you laugh, wonder and be amazed. His charm and talents also include my favorite song - Pure Imagination. Mr. Wilder has a very melodic and talent voice that sends shivers down your spine. He is got to be one of the best actors of our century and his Legacy that is Willie Wonka will be loved for generation to come. He is Willie Wonka, he is the magic and he is 100% of the fun.	5.0	Gene Wilder Is The man And The Magic!	2002-07-24	11	8	3

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1PEDCNJZ33WXN	Luke E Tesdal	Gene Wilder in an incomparable performance as Willy Wonka is everything you remember from your childhood, or will later if you are still a child. If you are looking for naughty children getting their comeuppance, eccentric recluses employing orange-faced little-people, or the furious hunt for golden tickets then this movie is for you. Personally I always thought the candy store owner (while an excellent singer of &#34;The Candy-Man Can,&#34; a song you should know) was sort of a jerk to Charlie; when all the other kids are in there he is just throwing candy around like it is free, and then poor Charlie comes in and the owner's clearing his throat to make sure he gets paid. Not cool bro. Also, no one really likes the song &#34;Cheer Up Charlie&#34; (so don't feel like you are alone if you use that interlude to refill your drink or make the sandwich you forgot to make before the movie started). I realize it explains he is poor and unhappy, and that his mother inexplicably thinks they will be able to do something about that, but I sort of got that anyway.Two suggestions: (1) Pay close attention to everything the school teacher says, and (2) feel free to close your eyes during the stuff in the tunnel: you can still hear the song with your eyes closed and you can hear how traumatizing the images are from the reactions of the people in the boat.	5.0	Pure Imagination...and that stuff in the tunnel.	2014-06-24	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AZT9OGZODW8VW	Lyman Green	If you like this movie (and I think it's safe to say I LOVE this movie) then you need to get the new blu-ray, whether you get the collector's box or not.  The box has a lot of extras, which are all well and good, but the best part is new blu-ray.  It looks and sounds great.  I swear, it seemed to me that the movie could have been made yesterday, not 40 years ago.  The color on this film is important, and it looks better than it ever has (VHS and DVD both of which I owned in the past).The extras in the box are really neat - there are some pre-production notes (reproduced) that are a time-capsule into the making.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1GJLHYQWLJQHX	Mad Paddy	Ive noticed that the boat ride scene in Willy Wonka is catching alot of negative flak from reviewers, many calling for it to be removed. Im tired of folks always wanting to censor and remove anything that can be remotely construed as offensive or damaging to children. Although its a scary scene, I saw this as a child and was not traumatized by it, maybe your kids are just wussies! I believe the scene was shot to add a dimension of danger to Wonka's world and truth be told, a dose of fear in children is healthy, not the kind of violent axe murderer stuff but the old fashioned fear of death or the unknown. Fear keeps kids in line and lets them know there are boundaries and repercussions, not everything in life is peachy keen and chocolate covered. I dont think the boat ride scene was made to scare the crap out of kids but just as a psychedilic freak out, it gets their minds working. Its a magical, mysterious, bizarre scene that is true Hollywood magic and Im glad to find that its still included despite the controlling, revisionist, sissyphied parents of today who want to shelter their kids from everyting and end up creating their own monsters who fear nothing, worry about nothing, and care about nothing. On another note, Gene Wilder is just fantastic in this movie, one of the all time best characters ever!	5.0	Boat Ride to Hell best scene in movie	2003-10-27	8	6	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1BKMYEQ6BP5B5	"Maria Beadnell ""gotlips"""	When I first saw this, I was a child who had just finished the book, and disliked the movie for being nothing like it. Well, I'm an adult now, and understand many movies can be excellent when they depart from the book. So my daughter and I saw it, on a big screen even. She loved it. Not me.First of all, as much as I love Gene Wilder, he never for a moment convinces me he's a crazy candy man. He's much too monotone, and too gentle in spirit, even as he lets children come to horrible ends. He should have used some of the energy expended in screaming at Charlie in the beginning in making us think he was the ball of wackiness that would have been necessary for that crazy, wonderful factory.They changed the 70s book depiction of the Oompa Loompas as pygmies (in the original book--illustrations since changed) for little people. It is painful to watch their attempts to dance (dwarfs being physically challenged and it was obvious).The plot changes make no sense. The scene wherein Grandpa Joe and Charlie decide to drink the fizzy lifting drink comes right after one child has met with some horrid fate, and Charlie being an obedient kid in the first place certainly wouldn't disobey after seeing Augustus sucked away or Veruca garbage chuted or whatever just happened.The producers couldn't let the dad be unable to support the family, so they killed him and had the mom do laundry. Laundry? In a tub? Like in the 50s? But the cars are from the 70s, so when does this take place?And--again, as an adult--where the heck does this take place? All the shopkeepers have English accents--OK, they are in England, notice the cobblestones. No, they can't be in England, they are using German coins, and the aerial view is of a German village. And two of the grandparents have German accents. But they can't be in Germany, Charlie and Wonka and Grandpa Joe and Mom and the newscasters have American accents.Some parts are wonderful! I have never seen a crew of child actors so excellent. Yes they are portraying nasty kids, but doing it beautifully. Every one of the kids is delivering the lines as if it really occurred to him or her just that instant. Of the adults, Jack Albertson is also excellent, even if the writing doesn't do the character justice.And the sets were colorful, crazy, believably weird.  But that didn't make up for a story that falls apart and an uninspired lead.That's the adult not liking it, though, and it wasn't made for me. My daughter, who'd never read the book, thought this movie was wonderful and read the book cover-to-cover afterwards in a day, not minding the differences.	3.0	Not only is it not like the book, it doesn't work within itself	2013-07-22	3	0	3

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2VVIT14CE3KGA	Mark Twain	"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has long been one of my all time favorites when it comes to children movies. The more I think about it, though, the more clear it becomes to think that this movie isn't only for the youngsters, but adults and teenagers alike. The humor that melts off of every single action and event, the zaniness of the story, the setting for which the film takes place in... all of it adds up to a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The book that this movie was based off of, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is also a favorite of mine, if not because Roald Dahl wrote it. That brings me to one of my biggest reasons why this movie was such a hit success: the man truly behind the story was not necessarily the director, but Dahl, who made up from scratch every nook and cranny you see. He also wrote the screenplay, as a matter of fact. From the almost loony Willy Wonka - - played perfectly by none other than the legendary Gene Wilder - - to the chocolate factory itself, it's hard not to take notice and admit that Mr. Dahl played an important role in the movies glory.So let's get down to the meat of the movie, shall we? The lead character of our story is a young boy by the name of Charlie Bucket (played by the talented Peter Ostrum) who lives in a lower-class neighborhood alongside his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) and several other ailing family members. Sweeping into town comes an announcement from behind the doors of a mysterious chocolate factory: five lucky children will have a chance to get a tour of the also mystical Willy Wonka's factory! The chase is on, and all chocolate factories from one end of the street to another are jam-packed of kids wanting to find the lucky golden ticket that holds the ""key"" to the tour. Before anyone knows what's happened, four kids have got their tickets. Sadly, all of them are spoiled rotten brats. This pattern changes when Charlie finds the final ticket, and he's ecstatic. Bringing along Grandpa Joe, Charlie embarks on the tour with high hopes. What he gets is more than a little unexpected, I'm sure.I can't help but take notice of the amazingly beautiful background that this film is saturated in. Yes, perhaps they are dated, but for a movie that was filmed in the early 1970's, the producers and what not did a superb job of making the whole ""fantasy candy land"" a reality, and I applaud them sincerely. I actually think it's better that this movie is so old, as it gives it a very surreal aura. I also cannot forget the acting! Throughout the movie I found myself honestly intrigued with every character that was thrown my way. Every actor made their persona as believable as possible, especially Gene Wilder who I have to tip my hat to. I first saw the man in Young Frankenstein, and he never ceases to surprise me with his unbelievable top-botch portrayal of zany characters. His job as Willy Wonka is no exception.Willy Wonka is a part of pop culture, it would seem. It's hard not to notice the effect that it's had on the States. Whether it's constant references to people turning into blueberries, the constant jokes about Oompa Loompa's, the memorable Marilyn Manson video where he imitates one of my favorite scenes in the movie... it all gives more reason to check this movie out. As I said before, this is a total family movie. Not just confined to the age-old ""child"" or ""adult"" categories, Willy Wonka crosses the border and becomes a classic that no one will forget any time soon. Check this one out now for good laughs, an intriguingly eccentric story and character line-up, and extraordinary acting to boot."	5.0	Caramel. And Cherries. And Peanuts, oh my!

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3U33FRD5JY8EG	Mark Twain	This is a movie that can be enjoyed at different levels.  DVD technology does this film justice as the scenery of the town and colors of the chocolate factory come off really well.  Willie Wonka is great because kids love him and adults can understand and even laugh at his dark side and offbeat humor.  The music is also great.  It's hard to believe this movie actually did poorly at the box office as it has now earned classic status.  My kid loves it.  She asks to watch it constantly and it lights up her imagination more than Disney movies.  The DVD actually gives you a choice to just play songs or select scenes.  It also offers commentary by the now grown up kids and director.  This is a good one to own rather than just rent.	5.0	DVD -Willie Wonka	2001-10-31	4	4	0

There's some great musical numbers, and the Oompa Loompas are quite lulzy (in a good way) Each of the scenes surrounding the first four children are entertaining, with some great musical numbers added (singing about how Veruca Salt is spoiled, etc) Compared to the newer version with Johnny Depp, this movie is good - well, I like both versions of the movie. If you liked the movie, please be sure to check out the book and its sequel, 'Charlie and the Glass Elevator' which picks up the story right after the first one ends.

I remember every time I watched the film I always had this craving for chocolate (hershey's bar, I wish I had a wonka bar though!), fizzy lifting drinks (7-up, minus the floating) and gobbstoppers (starbust)!

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	In 1971, Mel Stuart directed a hilarious musical fantasy entitled &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, based upon the 1964 children's novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; written by Roald Dahl (1916-1990), who also wrote &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; in 1961.  The story is about a little boy named Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) who works as a paperboy to help his impoverished &amp; widowed mother (Diana Sowle) pay their expenses by working as a paperboy.  Living with Charlie and his mother are all four of his grandparents: Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson, 1907-1981), Grandma Georgina (Dora Altmann, 1881-1971), Grandpa George (Ernst Ziegler, 1895-1980) and Grandma Josephine (Franziska Liebing, 1900-2000); none of which have gotten out of bed for twenty years.  In the same town where Charlie lives is the famous chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder).  One day while Charlie is in school with his strange schoolteacher, Mr. Turkentine (David Battley, 1935-2003), a momentous announcement is made:  Willy Wonka has started a contest to win a lifetime supply of chocolate.  The entire world becomes crazed with finding the five hidden golden tickets that are hidden in five Wonka chocolate bars.  Only the bearer of a golden ticket will have the opportunity to enter the mysterious chocolate factory and obtain the lifetime supply of chocolate.  Various children from around the globe find the golden tickets, including Charlie to the amazement of his family.  The winning children, and their accompanying adults, enter the most fantastic place that any of them have ever seen; but none of them could have imagined what their actions could merit.  The other four children and their accompanying adults include the selfishly whiney Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Mr. Henry Salt (Roy Kinnear), the conceited Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mr. Sam Beauregarde (Leonard Stone), the television-addicted Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen), Mrs. Teevee (Nora 'Dodo' Denney), the gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) and Mrs. Gloop (Ursula Reit).Memorable scenes in the film include children enjoying the delights of Bill the Candyman's (Aubrey Woods) candy store, Henry Salt's employees searching for a golden ticket, Willy Wonka's first appearance, the edible fantasy room, the invention room, the soda pop room, the golden geese room, the events in Willy Wonka's office and the amazing Wonka-vator.  Other memorable characters include Arthur Slugworth (G&uuml;nter Meisner, 1926-1994), The Tinker (Peter Capell, 1912-1986, newspaper-stand owner Mr. Jopeck (Werner Heyking) and the many Oompa Loompas played by several actors including George Claydon and Marcus Powell, who respectively played &quot;Strutter&quot; and &quot;Horseflesh&quot; in the 1981 film &quot;Time Bandits&quot;.  The film's very memorable songs were nominated for Best Original Music by the Academy Awards.  Each of the songs, along with with my ranking for each, are listed below:* &quot;The Candyman&quot; (5, performed by Aubrey Woods).* &quot;Cheer-up, Charlie (5, performed by Diane Sowle).* &quot;(I've Got a) Golden Ticket&quot; (5+, performed by Peter Ostrum &amp; Jack Albertson).* &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; (5++, performed by Gene Wilder).* &quot;Oompa Loompa&quot; (5, performed by the Oompa Loompas).* &quot;Wonderous Boat Ride&quot; (5+, performed by Gene Wilder)* &quot;Everlasting Gobstoppers/Oompa Loompa&quot;, (5, performed by the Oompa Loompas).* &quot;I Want It Now/Oompa Loompa&quot;, (5, performed by Julie Dawn Cole and the Oompa Loompas).* &quot;Wonkamobile, Wonkavision/Oompa Loompa&quot;, (4.5, performed by Gene Wilder and the Oompa Loompas).Overall, I rate the classic &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's a wonderful film that both children and adults alike can watch many times without becoming tiresome, and the film itself is by no means dated.  Both the dialog and plot were brilliantly executed and each of the many actors in the film did superb jobs in their roles, especially Gene Wilder.  If any producer attempted to film a remake of this film, I couldn't imagine anyone other than Gene Wilder in the role of Willy Wonka.	5.0	If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it	2003-11-16	4	2	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2R9J5LULVKF6T	Michael T. Rognlien	A dark look at the greed of children and a turn for the underdog, Willy Wonka was THE movie of my childhood years. It's got it all - the single mom, forced to care for her son and her aging, bed-ridden parents; the child who dreams of the impossible exit from poverty; the obnoxious brats who are one-by-one undone by virtue of their fatal character flaws; the triumphant rise of good over bad. While starting out a dreary film of life in the projects, the movie magically comes to live in full technicolor when we enter the magical land of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. This film deals with so many fantasies of young children (neverending supply of candy, good fortune, winning it all by &quot;being good&quot; etc) that it's almost too over-the-top. But either way, a great film and one that kids today still enjoy. Downside - No widescreen format for the hardcore movie purist.	4.0	The best movie John Waters never made..	2001-08-28	8	5	3

I just enjoy the journey, the memories, and some of the songs as well. The movie is really quite timeless. I think that Gene Wilder really does an excellent job playing the manic Willy Wonka. As compared to the more recent version (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with Johnny Depp), I think this version is more likeable, more down-to-earth, and just more fun. Don't watch it for the special effects, don't watch for the depth of the characters, or how true it is to the original story; watch it because it is just plain fun -- a kind of fun we really don't have in movies any more.	4.0	A classic worth buying	2013-07-14	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2H22I2RWE0HOV	Mr. Sinister	With the newer, brighter, more Tim-Burtonized version now on the shelves, we need to take a look back and remember the original for what it is and what it was.  First of all, Gene Wilder is genius in the role of Willy Wonka.  Hands down his most memorable performance (that isn't said lightly, either).  Wilder played the part as half madman, half petulant child.  Hysterical in places.  The songs are etched into the memory of two generations.  Lacking the perfection of todays FX wizardry, the overall production value was great at the time of its release.  Is Burton's version better?  Hmmmm.  No.  Closer to the book...yes, but not better.  Depp is classic as usual, but I felt a lot of the new movie was borrowed not from the book but from the Wilder version (even though Burton claimed not to be a fan of the original....sacreligious!).  This is one of those childhood classics like The Wizard Of Oz or It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.  Untouchable. Beautiful.Dig it!	5.0	Still The All-Time Classic	2005-11-10	4	2	2
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2HLDJAXE9U9HI	Mrs. K	"This is a very special movie any family would enjoy watching together. In a fun atmosphere it delivers good, old-fashioned family values-in memorable songs courtesy of the lovable Oompa Loompas.While still a child at heart, Charlie is mature beyond his years. He is caring, unselfish, unspoiled, and he loves his family. Although he's poor he always gives more than he takes. After all, he buys the bar that wins the Golden Ticket ""for my Grandpa Joe"".I watched it by myself last night purely for my own pleasure. I giggled with joy at that triumphant moment when Charlie peeled back the corner of that Wonka bar to expose the corner of the ticket. I laughed at crazy Wonka's wit and dark sarcasm-which will leave the parents entertained without frightening the kids. And, as always, there's Veruca Salt. (Yep, a veruca IS a wart. LOL!) I guarantee every child will remember her and strive to behave better!The book is almost always more rewarding and this is no exception (the book has darker, adult-humor overtones that will whisk right over the kiddies' heads). But for a movie the whole family can watch and enjoy, you can't go wrong with this classic."	5.0	Family values delivered in a sweet story	2006-02-25	1	1	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2L119B70PDKAH	musicfan	I do not understand why this bigoted movie became so popular. I find it to be extremely offensive. The suggestion that Willie Wonka has midgets as his own personal slaves is horrible. This clear exploitation of a genetic disorder is disgusting. Not only are they midgets, but they are also orange. This leads me to believe that Willie Wonka would favor the days of slavery when non-whites were put to work on plantations. I have heard that this is a very popular movie among members of the KKK. You sheep are blind and have allowed this racist, bigoted, piece of filth to enter your children's' minds and make them believe in a world of white supremacy.

Well, trust me your kid will enjoy it. It is a great movie! For all who may have missed it over the years (is there anyone out there?), the story is about a giant chocolate factory run by a never seen owner (Wilder). Over the years of the factory's operation he has become quite the legend. He decides to open the factory to a few lucky winners of a contest ~ all but one of the winning kids are truly rotten. And as all good stories go, the bad kids get their just ""desserts"" (sorry, couldn't resist the pun) leaving the good kid to win. A lot of good lessons taught about sharing, greed, gluttony and theft. Pop some popcorn and enjoy it with your kid; you'll be glad you did."	5.0	Still a great one!	2004-07-07	2	1	1

Follow Charlie as he and 5 other children enter into Mr. Wonka's (perfectly played by Gene Wilder) chocolate factory.  Soon you are immersed in a world of orange men and candy galore.  The films charm and creativity are only overshadowed by it's dark and almost morbid undertones.  The children begin to fall by the waste-side one by one.  The children will appreciate the visual affects and the playful side of the film while adults will revel in the wit of Wonka and his many snide remarks and one liner jabs.  The DVD even has a sing-a-long! (yey)  So now even YOU can sing right along with those Oompa-Loompas.  Enjoy.	5.0	Dementia Exemplified	2002-01-03	1	0	1
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2NSCDHYL2Q825	Noah	I love this movie. I've owned a copy of the VHS version for about 11 years now, and last week I purchased the DVD. Yes, its full frame, but I don't know why everyone is so upset about it. If you look on the back of the case of the DVD, it tells you that the movie was filmed in full frame, not widescreen. They had to change it for the theatrical release. You are not missing anything with this DVD, this is how the director intended it! The transfer is very crisp, especially the &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; room, it looks luscious with bright colors. The extras are great. Its a delight with the audio commentary, for the actors, thirty years later, enjoy making fun of each other as they watch the film for the first time ever together. They also tell how about how some of the effects were done. They are so funny, especially Julie Dawn Cole (whole played snobby Veruca Salt). The documentary is intesting to watch. The intro of the DVD and the transition to each feature is spectaculare. You entre the Wonka Elevator and are transported to the Special Features and such.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1AJLWQRKCZD7R	Noelle W Dempsey	I'm one of those people that wonders whatever happened to child actors of my favorite movies.  This movie definitely caters to that curiosity.  The new featurette has interviews with all the actors talking about what it was like to make the film and what they've been doing since.  There's also a touching interview with Gene Wilder in that featurette.  I had a delightful surprise with the running commentary!  It's all the kids from the movie together for the first time!  They share interesting stories about filming the scenes and seem to be having a great time with some good-natured teasing.  The guy who was Augustus doesn't seem to talk much - I'm not sure if he understood what  everyone was saying - or maybe he just doesn't speak much.  I get a feeling that those kids really WERE playing themselves from the commentary.  It adds a fun dimension to the film but I tend to like the commentary features on DVDs.  I think the commentary's my favorite part.The sing along does not have the popular &quot;Candy Man&quot; song, which is a bummer, but it also doesn't have that maudlin &quot;Cheer up Charlie&quot; song - always had to fast forward through that one.  It does include the corresponding scenes with the songs but doesn't always have the words at the bottom:  &quot;I've got a Golden Ticket&quot; with Grandpa Joe, &quot;World of Pure Imagination&quot; with Willy Wonka, &quot;I Want it Now&quot; with Veruca Salt, and the Oompa Loompa song that came after Veruca fell down the eggdicator.All in all it's a fun DVD.  Only complaint is its not widescreen.  But I've really been enjoying all the features.	4.0	Fun little extras!	2001-12-31	3	3	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	"In an age where it's becoming increasingly difficult to find films that are truly kid-friendly, it's nice to be able to fall back on classic movies like this one.  I watched this over the weekend with my 8-year old son, who saw it for the first time (it was my third or fourth viewing).  He enjoyed it immensely, but I also didn't mind making a little diversion into the world of ""pure imagination"" for a while.For those poor few sheltered souls who have never seen the movie, it's all about young Charlie's dream to break free from his life of poverty in London and experience every kid's fantasy -- winning a tour of the world famous Willy Wonka chocolate factory to meet the mysterious Willy Wonka himself (played by Gene Wilder).  Oh, there's also the matter of a lifetime supply of chocolate.  Charlie is a character of pure, unselfish heart who never lets go of hope even in the face of overwhelming odds.  He stands in stark contrast to the greedy, self-centered children (and their parents) who join Charlie on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure, and who provide wonderful object lessons about how NOT to be.The story is replete with song, color and fantasy as Willy Wonka takes Charlie and the others on a great adventure through his chocolate factory.  Pure imagination is the order of the day, and strange wonders await behind every door.  Willy Wonka can be described as eccentric, to say the least, but his philosophy can be summed up in his simple statement -- ""We are the music makers; we are the dreamers of dreams.""  Gene Wilder does a marvelous job bringing this character vividly to life.If you've never seen this one, by all means do, and make sure your kids are with you.  It's more fun when the grown-up kids and the not-so-grown-up kids share the experience.  ""Willy Wonka"" is destined to remain a classic."	4.0	A classic family film, a gem for kids young and old.	2005-03-07	5	3	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3HNBLO0KIJVTS	"paper tiger ""Adriel August"""	This review is for the 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition Blu-ray.We all know Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a great movie. This review is simply the mechanics of this special edition set.It is very nice box set and well organized and put together. However, to keep all the items in place are these clear cheap thin plastic pieces which make the whole set look a little cheap. I rather have foam like material to keep the items where they belong. The discs are on the bottom in a candy bar looking cardboard foldout sleeve, so you must dig through all the other items to get to the movie.The box is colorful and fairly solid. It is slightly thicker than the Warner Brothers I am Legend special edition box set. When standing upright the top just slides off, but you need it to be on it's side or all the stuff will fall out. Really nothing of any use. I'll never use the smelly pencils or eraser. I wish the Blu-ray/DVD case was a steelbook or something a little stronger than cardboard. The golden ticket is cool and some of the other stuff is all right.I had the Willy Wonka & Chocolate Factory UK Blu-ray and I can honestly say this disc looks and sounds a lot better. It is probably the same as previous USA Blu versions, though to me it looks the best it ever has.Over-all it is a nice set to have if you are a big fan like me. Each box is labeled as to what limited number you are out of 100,000. This label is actually a silver sticker on the outer cover of the box set. I wish it was on the inside somewhere, but that is ok. If you are hesitant, maybe wait until the price drops a little. I can't see this item selling out or being hard to find as there are 100,000 of them and it's not the best set in the world. But at $43.99, I am not disappointed with the set, movie, or cost.	5.0	40th Anniversary Collector's Edition Blu-ray	2011-10-19	13	12	1

Just a little too lightweight and creaky for me. (not being blinded by nostalgia, I think the Tim Burton film is far superior).

I wouldn't pay that unless Gene Wilder delivered it personally) I suggest waiting until the price reaches a reasonable level.	2.0	$45.00? Isn't that a wee bit overpriced?	2012-04-27	10	1	9

All those kids were old enough to know right from wrong, were rude to their parents and all others in their vacinity, refused instruction a got their just deserts. I'm sure they all came out OK in the end. They and their parents needed a little lesson.  Those reviewers outraged by their fate have never been babysitters or had a belly laugh at a Warner Bros. cartoon.Hint: It's not real, and kids today figure that out pretty easily, they are much more sophisticated than we were.But I have deducted a star for that LSD trip boat ride!

Why do all the grandparents sleep in that one bed? Why is Charlie so happy? A complete mystery to me, but I love the movie.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A7BD39Y0G0LTQ	person with opinions on internet	I watched the movie first as a child and did not understand why it was supposed to be such a wonderful family classic. There are several reasons that I disliked it particularly, the first being that it was not true to the book at all, and a very poor representation too. Many, many liberties were taken; characters were left out altogether, some not in the book were added, and many that were left in were changed significantly.The music was absolutely horrible, I must say. The Oompa Loompas with their &quot;Oompa Loompa Doopitie Doo, I've got a pretty puzzle for you&quot; and their bizarre dances practically made me nauseous. They are a far cry indeed from the lovable and hilarious Oompa Loompas of Roald Dahl's book. Read it if you don't understand the comparison. It's very good.Most of the acting I disliked very much; I thought Gene Wilder's performance in particular was very bad, and about as untrue to the book as you could get. The only actor that I liked at all was the one who played Veruca Salt; she did a fairly good job of portraying an entirely spoiled brat.Finally, the scenery and the special effects were absolutely terrible. The scene with the chocolate waterfall looked cheap and it, again, was very far from the scene described in the book. The boat ride scene can be somewhat frightening to young children, but although it did not scare me it was incredibly strange and the effects were, once again, quite bad.I might recommend this to children between five and eight, as my sister liked it when she was seven, but it has very little to offer to adults (unless there is a nostalgia factor for you), and if you're a teenager, like me, clear out and stay out. I am sure that you will regret doing otherwise. Above all, do not watch this movie if you loved the book. It's a horrible rendition. I hope that the remake will be better.	2.0	What's all the fuss?	2003-12-30	42	8	34

"I purchased this since I am on the 10% discount club for the year buying HD-DVD discs, and given my experience I feel that HD-DVD will win if for no other reason than many of the movies have a ""Combo"" disc - one side is for HD-DVD ONLY and the other side is for regular DVD - awesome so you can loan out the movie even if the people do not have and HD-DVD player.To this movie specifically, unlike many of the other HD titles this movie does have extra materials and was very interesting.  The quality of the transfer is on par with other older movies.  They are noticeably crisper than the non-HD counterparts - even on an upconverting DVD player.  The re-mastered sound is great and all-in-all I can find no faults.

Well, being the classic movie buff that I am (especially in blu ray format), it piqued my interest. First of all, the price. They were selling it for $25, a savings of over $40! Sale? I'm there! Secondly, I read the product description. They loaded this package to the teeth!!! Too many surprises to list, but I'm telling you, THIS IS THE GREATEST COLLECTOR'S EDITION I HAVE EVER SEEN!! If only Marvel put as much thought and effort into properly selling ""The Avengers"", I would've bought that too. There were so many disappointed fans of that release, I didn't even bother.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AQTLEPYWOJNEM	P. Simmons	"(((Spoiler following))) I watched this movie on TV for rhe first time when I was 6 years old and I haven't outgrown it since!  It is a wonderful story about the power of imagination and how good things eventually come to those who do the right things.  The movie is based on the Roald Dahl book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""  Willy Wonka is an eccentric candy maker who initiates a contest offering a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate to five lucky winners who find a golden ticket in their Wonka bars.  One of them is Charlie Bucket, an impoverished, but good natured,  child who hopes for a better future for himself, his mother and his grandparents.  The other four winners are some of the nastiest, most obnoxious and brattiest children imaginable.  Augustus Gloop is an overeating glutton, Violet Beauregard is a gum chewing fanatic with no manners (picking her nose while talking about how disgusting spitting is), Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat who wants everything she sees and whines until she gets it and Mike Teavee is a television addict with a smart mouth.  One by one, they are eventually done in by their bad habits.  Augustus falls into the chocolate river after drinking from against Wonka's objections and is sucked into a pipe, Violet chews a piece of Wonka's ""meal gum,"" although Wonka warns her not to, and turns purple and blows up into a giant blueberry, Veruca goes on a tantrum when Wonka tells her she can't have one of his giant geese and she falls down a garbage chute and Mike wants to be on television so badly, he willingly gets zapped into the size of an insect by Wonka's TV camera.  Charlie, by being the respectable child that he is and by not compromising his integrity, not only completes the tour, he wins a prize beyond his wildest dreams.The parents make it obvious why their children are so impish.  When the children get into trouble at the factory, the parents blame Wonka instead of the kids' own bratty behavior.  From the moment they step into the factory, they're complaining and finding fault with everything Wonka does and they take things way too seriously (much like the critics of this film)!  I bet if the Oompa Loompas, with their wisdom, raised these little demons, they'd be much better.Don't miss this film.  It is not only a fun to watch diversion from reality, the messages are very timely and it makes you think about the good that still exists in this world.  The critics and nitpickers may not get it but anyone who watches with an open mind and doesn't take it too seriouly will."	5.0	Timeless classic!	2004-03-13	10	7	3

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2C5F13FC6KM45	"Ransom Carroll ""A Concerned Citizen"""	"This movie is intensely uneven; 85% is the most fantastic cinematic experience ever bar none.  15% is painfully sappy musical.  What is even more amazing than the unevenness is that the Depp remake is half much more literal and faithful to the book, and half completely invented new plot, with one cheap gag worthy of the Zucker brothers (the ""flags of all nations"" exhibit).  What is it about this fantastic work that means that people get most of the way there and then go insane?  Could it be that the themes touch too deeply inside us?Although Depp's performance is also magnificent, Gene Wilder really IS Wonka in a deep (not Depp) way.  And he delivers the key lines that get across the film's main lessons...perfectly.  He even pulls off a song (""Land of pure imagination"") in a way that is touching, dramatically balanced, and empirically justified.  And the main lesson comes across:  Candy is to children as dreams are to adults.  And candy is all about purity--the children are weeded out because they bring greed and selfishness to the realm of candy making.  The movie has more of a concession to our wishy-washy morality than Dahl's book (he was never one to shy away from the gruesome death and mutilation of those who deserved it), in that everyone is supposed to turn out all right, but the comeuppance is still a severe one:  thou shalt not lie, at least within the candy factory.For a long time I was troubled by the fact that the film makers introduced this gratuitous scene in which Charlie and his grandpa broke the rules themselves.  The whole point of the original was that there were two kinds of kids, bad and good.  Charlie was good, so he gets the factory.  End of story.  If he is also bad, what's the point?Although I still think it led to cinematic weakness, on a moral level, I think that this concession to reality was important.  It reminds us that even the heroes, even those who really do care about the miracle of candy, can make mistakes, they can break the rules.  Unless you're going to live your life like some nerdy Oompah-Loompah, you've got to make some tough decisions.  In a world in which some guy wielding crazy knives can threaten you, maybe you should at least hedge your bets and tell Slugworth you might have something for him.  At least, if he promises to get the knife sharpener off your back.  [16]"	5.0	Candy and dreams	2008-02-05	1	1	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2OW6TJLWSKUJ3	Reviewer When Required	Being one of my favorite books when I was much younger, I was very excited when I first heard that a WONKA movie existed. I don't remember when I first saw the movie, but it's been worth seeing several times since... and  I decided to buy the DVD once I had a player. I wasn't disappointed.This  DVD features crisp audio and video... perhaps not quite up to par with true  'philehead expectations, but plenty good for the average viewer like  myself. Wilder provides an excellent portrayal of Wonka, from the opening  Wizard-of-Oz-like transition from the streets of the city to his factory,  through the vices of the contestants that devour them one by one, up to the  ending scene in the magic elevator.  Physical comedy abounds throughout,  and Peter Ostrom does a surprisingly good job of playing Charlie.  I'm  highly critical of child actors but had no problems here.Not a ton on  the Bonus Materials side of the DVD, but it does include some interesting  Production Notes.All in all, a grand addition to any movie collection  that includes timeless classics from an age not quite faded into the past.  You'll enjoy it as much as your children (or cousins or neighbor's children  or whomever the younger people in your life may be). The boat in the tunnel  scene still spooks me, Wonka's antics still entrance me, and the songs of  the Oompa's still teach me as much now as when I first watched this  wondeful film.	4.0	A Golden Ticket to fun for you AND the kids!	2000-06-30	34	14	20
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2IYUCI5A26O82	R. Hansen	I have loved this film since childhood, and like all good films that children like, it has stood up to the well-earned cynicism of my adulthood. That is of course because it is good on binary levels; that of a beloved kid's movie and a sentimental disportment for adults. That is why it is not only endearing, but enduring.An entertaining mix of irony, camp and charm, it is made of the stuff that produces dreams in the young and a longing for insouciance for the old. Who could resist this fantasy world within the walls of that enigmatic candy factory where the wallpaper is edible and rivers flow with chocolate? Who could not hum along with the crafty music numbers (mega kudos to songwriters Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley)? And of course who could not love the homunculin Oompa Loompas?The child actors/actresses are great. They serve to provide a certain satisfaction to the audience because in truth there is a reticent schadenfreude in seeing bratty kids get a comeuppance or two. And not enough can be said about Gene Wilder. He is brilliant in this role that has a underlying Oscar Wilde wit to it. In fact his appearance is a demarcated turning point in the movie in both tone and irony. I'm not sure who else could have pulled off this unique mix of lovability and acidulousness.	5.0	Great on many levels	2004-08-02	4	2	2

Gene Wilder is perfectly cast and the kids (as well as adults) in the movie did an excellent job.  In the review before this one, lizardkingjr stated that the nose picking scene with Violet was cut from the widescreen edition.

I have a special place for this kind of movie not only because it's very good but it's also one of those classic mix of movie/singing films that was done extremely well. The acting from everyone in the film was perfect for their roles especially for the children actors/actresses and of course Gene Wilder was great as Willy Wonka. So for fans who saw this movie either at the theater or t.v. now we have it on dvd to keep in our movie library for us and the younger generation to enjoy whenever they wish to watch this enjoyable movie....	5.0	A Great Classic Movie Remembered Fondly Now For Every Child And Adult To Enjoy	2013-04-19	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1FZI1F22GRO4C	Richard Veysey	This is a great, timeless movie about simple acts of kindness shining in a dark world, or, to put it more simply, how people, whether good or bad, get what they deserve.  Featuring Rahl Dahl's classic style of dark comedy, and mixing in a little dark chocholate, Willy Wonka delights from begining to end.The movie starts introducing the children, most of whom are gluttonous, vile creatures (they can be called nothing better), and their equally awful parents.  Charlie and his grandfather would be the one exception to this.  Charlie is the son of poor parents and enjoys the few things he has.  He could almost be viewed as a personification of youthful innocence.Willy Wonka, played brilliantly by Gene Wilder, decides to place five 'golden tickets' inside five of his candy bars, and each of the children gets one.  One of the girls has been horribly spoiled by her disgusting father, one is a fat brat, the other two are described slightly less, but one is basically a TV addict, and the other... Well, I can't remember anything except what happens to them in the factory.  Charlie one day runs into a man who gives him a candy bar with one of the golden tickets inside.  Soon Willy Wonka has drawn all the children and their parents into the magical world inside his factory, where anything is possible.The movie follows the book quite well (although the squirrels from the book were replaced by the very entertaining Umpa-Lumpas because they couldn't find a way have giant squirrels working in the factory).  Each of the horrid children find themselves getting what they deserve, not dying, but sent to the inner parts of the factory, such as the furnace (some of the Umpa-Lumpas go to rescue her).I myself don't care that much for the begining parts of the movie, but once Gene Wilder gets on the scene, the movie suddenly glows with his wacky light, and energy which he seems able to put in all his movies.If you're a fan of Gene Wilder, he won't disapoint you, if you're a fan of Rahl Dahl, the movie is wonderfully accurate to his vision, if you're a fan of candy, you'll see lots of it.  The only people I can see not enjoying this movie are the TV addicts, gluttons, and greedy people upon which the children in the book and movie were based.	4.0	One of the most brilliant children's movies ever made	2004-12-21	4	2	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3MQ15651KGVLJ	Rick L. Parrish	This verdict from my Six Year Old Granddaughter who upon entering my bedroom and finding me watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory asked me &#34;Whatcha Watchin'?&#34; and was told Willy Wonka....Squinted her eyes at Depp's androgynous face and frowned for a moment and then announced &#34;Wait...Grandpa...Wait...&#34; and ran off down the hall only to return ten minutes later with this DVD in her hand and pushing it prominently into my face announced &#34;That's not Willy Wonka...Grandpa!!...THIS is Willy Wonka!!!&#34;  Let's Watch!  Let's Watch!So Mr. Wilder where ever you are (first thanks for all those wonderful performances that lightened our hearts) rest easy.  After having seen both Cindy (the aforementioned Granddaugher) is firmly in your corner and after having laughingly told this story many times to many of my peers I've been pleasantly surprised to hear it repeated many times in return.  To those kids who would die for that Golden Ticket you're the only one who can hand it out!!.  No offence to Mr. Depp who has turned in his share of wonderful performances as well.  But there can be no argument about who the toddlers love (except perhaps in Mr. Depp's house of course) as Willy Wonka.  Don't ask me why...I find them both entertaining but the Ticket Holders have spoken.So if you have any doubts about whether this movie is any good...just realize how many generations of youngsters Mr. Wilder has enchanted so far with his wonderfully whimsical and yet wondrously winning Willy Wonka.  But he's not alone in catching all those little hearts as the movie is beautifully cast and produced in all those candy colors kids just adore.  Tis the classic...there can be no doubt.	5.0	Wilder Has No Challengers	2014-03-28	1	1	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3K1RVYM3JQZZS	Ricky Hunter	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a wonderful film.  For reasons that are now mysterious to me, I missed its theatrical release when I was nine despite being a huge fan of the book.  I think it best to blame my mother and move on.  Seeing it for the first time just recently I was delighted that the darkness inherent in the tone of the book was only slightly toned down  which is quite a feat considering how candy colourful the entire movie become once the children enter the factory.  The songs are harmless and, generally, throwaway but charming in their own quiet way and Gene Wilder makes a delightful Willy Wonka.  I waited too long to get to this treasure but I am glad to have finally joined the cult.	5.0	A Cult-Like Pleasure	2004-08-03	3	2	1
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1XBOR5UPW9AYB	Riley A. Vann	If you have children, want children, are a kid, or ever were a kid, you can enjoy this movie.  Children can enjoy the spectacle and excess of the candy and music.  Adults can enjoy the marvelous acting (the role that Gene  Wilder was born to play) and hidden literary references and metaphors for  the modern industrial society.  The problem with so many children's movies  today are that they refuse to have an edge.  This movie not only has an  edge, but actually pushes people right off of it.	5.0	the greatest children's movie ever made	2000-05-09	3	2	1

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AXC4OG5GQ9A58	"R. Miller ""drifter2k"""	"Firstly, despite what one reviewer says, the widescreen edition is NOT simply the deceptively named 'full screen' version with the top and bottom chopped off (no, it's not a 'faked' widescreen) it was originally filmed 'open-matte' in a 1.33:1 ratio (same as a 4:3 television), a process which involves covering up (matting out) the top and bottom of the image for presentation in theatres to create a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. I do not like this method of filming as it gives widescreen movies an underserved bad name. The widescreen shape is what the director intended to be seen but ,alas, it does offer less visible image than the open matte version so can make one feel ripped off! However, that said, keep in mind that when movies filmed this way are seen 'full frame' the artistic composition of the shot is often lost and sometimes things that shouldn't be visible such as microphones are seen. Widescreen is easily the way to go if you want to see the most image on the vast majority of releases as 'open-matte' is really not all that common a format.I would not say 'buyer beware' just 'buyer be aware' that there are a myriad of formats. I would encourage anyone who isn't familiar about the different film formats to do a web search for the letterbox and widescreen advocacy page for an excellent visual description of the various formats and matting techniques used in films.Finally, this movie is a lot of fun and I recommend it to children and adults alike. Yes, the boat ride is kind of bizarre and perhaps could be a bit unsettling for some, but it's no more scary (in my opinion) than a lot of scenes in 'The Wizard Of Oz' such as the witches legs curling up after she gets crushed by Dorothy's house. Children can't be so sheltered from life so as to not see a bit of darkness at times. Also, the worm in the 'Willy Wonka' boat ride scene crawls across a living person's face not a dead person...you can see their eyes follow the movement of the worm. One more comment on the boat ride scene...despite what a reviewer said, the widescreen version DOES have violet picking her nose while saying ""spitting is such a dirty habbit"" - my copy certainly does anyhow.I would give it 4.5 stars if I could but will have to round it off at 5.p.s. I must mention that Amazon.com incorrectly shows the widescreen ratio of this DVD as being 2.35:1 instead of its actual 1.85:1 ratio."	5.0	Widescreen is not what everyone will want for Wonka because:	2003-01-07	21	18	3
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"First of all, I will not try to compare the Gene Wilder version with the book.  Never read the book, so have no preconceived notitions.  I was eight when the movie first came out, and actually went to see it.  Don't remember too much about the experience, except the film seemed ENDLESS and boring.About eight years ago, we rented it for our then 9 year old son.  Didn't make it to the end...boring.Saw it again last night on DVD.  Lovely transfer, decent sound, ridiculous movie.The best part of the film is the terrific performance by Gene Wilder.  His performance was, frankly, ahead of its time.  He's a loon.  At one moment sweet and open, the next frightening with his wide-eyed gaze, the next barely engaged in his surroundings.  He's snide and whispers some really droll insults under his breath.  Just the kind of thing ""heroes"" in kids movies didn't do back in 1971.  His performance makes the film bearable.Everything else is dreadful.  The sets are cheesy beyond belief.  The boat ride through the terrifying tunnel is total out of place (a centipede crawling over a person's slightly open mouth!!  What the..??!!??).  It feels like Luis Bunuel.  The songs are mostly totally forgettable, and even the ones we know (THE CANDYMAN CAN) are horrifically staged.The circumstances under which Charlie lives are not amusing or quirky.  My first thought upon seeing it just recently was ""He needs to be put into a foster family...NOW.)  He appears to be the only breadwinner, while his grandparents sit around in bed all day.  There's probably a good reason for it, but it's not explained.  I guess they're just ""quirky.""  Charlie uses his meager earnings to buy tobacco for Grandpa Joe.  Even in 1971, tobacco shouldn't have been so glorified.The famous OOPAH-LOOMPAS (who DO have a memorable little tune to provide us) are just creepy, in all the worst ways.  Their dancing is terrible and out of synch.The adult actors in the film all overact tremendously.  The young kids who play Charlie's fellow contest winners work really hard at being obnoxious...and they are!!  But there's no nuance to the roles...they just all kinda scream and throw fits and carry on.  Except Augustus, who is so busy stuffing his face you can't even understand his dialogue.  And Veruca Salt isn't just a greedy brat, she's a psychopath of the first order!I realize I'm sounding like a grinch.  The movie is beloved the world over.  Kids movies aren't supposed to be ""realistic.""  But I believe even a totally unrealistic scenario has to have its own reality that we can tune in to.  It's own set of rules.  This film is made so clumsily and unattractively that it's pretty hard to find a way into the world so that we can believe the outrageous characters.  Mostly, I just hate them.I know I'll take a lot ""not helpful"" hits for this, but I feel I must be honest.  And I truly believe if someone actually HASN'T seen this film before they should be spared."	2.0	UNASSAILABLE CLASSIC...yet it's a pretty rotten movie	2005-07-15	45	11	34

Starring Gene Wilder, it won awards as a musical, but did not breathe as well as the Tim Burton version starring Johnny Depp, primarily because of better special effects (although the 2005 version is not particularly digital). The troop of factory workers (Oompa-Loompas) were unfortunately unattractive, whereas the modern trick of making all of them from the same person (Deep Roy) made them quite magical.	3.0	Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory not as good as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	2013-12-23	4	0	4

I figured it is worth mentioning since Amazon has clumped together reviews from various editions.I'm not going to talk much about the movie itself since I'm sure almost everyone reading this has seen the film at least once and if not, I don't want to give out any spoilers and ruin the movie for you.The first thing I want to mention is the dvd photo in Amazon's listing is incorrect. This is NOT a two dvd set as shown. I'm holding it with my blueberry stained fingers and it is only ONE dvd.Video: The movie is presented in 1:78 anamorphic widescreen. This is a fairly clean and colorful transfer. There are some grainy spots in the film but it is not too bad. Overall, Warners has done a nice remastering job on the film.Sound: There is an English 5.1 dolby digital track that sounds fantastic. Amazon fails to mention that there are French,Spanish,and Portuguese 1.0 mono dubs. All three sound crap-tastic.Subtitles: There are English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.Extras: The most significant extra is the commentary with the ""wonka kids"". The ""wonka kids"" are all grown up and have got together in one room for the first time since making the movie. The commentary track is fun and informative and well worth a listen. The only other extra of any real significance is the 30 minute Pure Imagination documentary. There is also a 4 minute 1971 featurette,an onscreen cast and crew menu,four sing-a-long songs,a photo gallery, and a trailer.Also included in my dvd case are three fruity smelling sheets of stickers.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A22IF678HKJEO8	Roy Kristiansen	"It's mostly a matter of preference, relating to the type of screen that's in your home. We've been through this discussion so many times by now and I still can't come to a clear-cut, one-size-fits-all opinion. It's true that some films originally shot in 1.33:1 and then cropped for the theater DO look better in their full-screen version. I'm thinking of films like Koyaanisqatsi. However, in this case I've got to go with widescreen. There are any number of shots that are much more convincing without seeing the tops and bottoms of the sets - the first shot of Charlie's family, all stretched out in the same bed, gives you the visual joke straight off by emphasizing side-to-side, rather than vertical. Likewise, the Candy Room looks (to me, at least) less like a big clunky set on a studio soundstage by allowing you to imagine what's above it, rather than showing you that nothing is. This cropping of films for the ""widescreen"" theater is part of production planning right from the start (the cinematographer has a set of ""lines"" to look through so he can tell which part of the image is actually intended for the screen), and the 4X3 versions that make it to home video are mostly a concession to those folks who simply can't stand those black bars on their analog sets. I predict this will change as more widescreen sets make it into homes.One last note: the widescreen version of Airplane! is similarly cropped. I did a simultaneous A/B comparison of the full- and widescreen home-vid releases and found that the visible parts of the images on both were *exactly* the same size. There was no ""zooming"" involved for the widescreen. I must say, though, that I have no more patience for cropping films *intentionally* shot for release in 4X3, to achieve a false widescreen look (theater owners were, for a long time, notorious for doing this to the great Disney animated classics), than I do with that hideous old practice of ""colorizing"" original black-and-white films for TV."	4.0	A Matter of Preference	2009-08-14	2	1	1

This luscious story, full of wisdom, laugh-out-loud humor, and visual  delights galore, is one of those rare timeless kids' movies that truly  endures.  The music, which includes the songs Candy Man and the beautiful  ballad Pure Imagination, is enduring as well.  You and your family will  love the off-kilter but somehow recognizable world created by writer Roald  Dahl, as well as the faultess performances of every adult and every child  in this lovingly imagined classic.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AEGR40GALMDJ4	Ryne Williams	Okay, one thing I must complain about this film is that it is so unlike Roald Dahl's book.  I would not be pleased.  The film is good and is a definate classic but, good grief, they could've been faithful to the book just a little more.  Gene Wilder carried the film all on his shoulders.  The movie did not get going until his appearance.  The music is okay, and the sets are fantastic.  The effects are also brilliant.  The child acting was fair.  Overall it is a good film, but not really good.  A definate for kids and fans of musicals.	4.0	Not wonderful but a great movie.	2004-05-05	1	0	1

All the beautiful colors and the candies in the movie were attractive to kids. What is more important was that there was a big moral lesson behind the story.

The story is fun, the characters are funny and very quotable, and even though the effects in it are a bit dated, nobody really cares because it is all so... fun! That is the best word to describe the entire film. And although I am not the biggest fan of musicals, all of the songs in the film are (surprise) very fun and enjoyable (with perhaps an excpetion for ""Cheer Up Charlie"", which is a song I always fast-forwarded as a kid, but watching it now it is tolerable). In fact, the film is a lot more fun to watch as an adult, surprisingly. There are so many jokes that a kid would never understand that when you get older just make it that much funnier. There's no question about it, if you are a living, breathing, organism, you have to get this movie. Right now. I'm not joking. And this DVD is the best way to go (especially in WIDESCREEN, yippie!) for a great transfer, and all the bonus features.

How right he was! Though director Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is more faithful to Roald Dahl's book, it lacks the awe and wonderment of the original 1971 film. ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" endures as a family classic - aided by Wilder's bravura performance, Harper Goff's production design and Mel Stuart's underrated direction.

I just thought it was really weird to make Willy Wonka a woman . . . . . I have since been enlightened, but my opinion remains the same: there can only be one Willy Wonka, and that is Gene Wilder, hands down. No offense to Johnny; he makes a perfectly-lovable Mad Hatter.I am outraged that this movie is being sold at such a cheap price, like a piece of junk. I am, however, somewhat consoled that the remake is only 92 cents more.""You know what happened to the man who got everything he always wanted, don't you?""""What?""""He lived happily ever after."""	5.0	Still unbeatable	2013-03-28	0	0	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1CJPRF2X3V9EH	"S. Hall ""Associate Professor of Communication"""	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory belongs in the ranks of surreal film which includes The Wizard of Oz and An American in Paris.  Perhaps it is something about the musical genre which thus frees the mind.  One of the  more memorable films from my youth (the Oompa Loompas haunted my dreams),  having viewed it again I now see a tremendous amount of social commentary,  some of which is laughably dated (as are certain of the special effects).  Gene Wilder's performance is absolutely top notch, and one of the main  reasons to see the film; his oscillation between mania and dry indifference  proves how he intimately knows &quot;the land of pure  imagination&quot;.As for DVD details, the little bonus items (film  details, cast bios, a bit about Roald Dahl's book) are of the standard  variety, more like sprinkles atop a Wonka cupcake - you will appreciate  them as eye candy, but they are not really satisfying.  The film transfer  is good, the colors being quite vivid.  As for the remix of the soundtrack  into 5.1, prepare for a little disappointment.  While the sound itself is  crisp, the subwoofer and rear channels were not really utilized to any  significant degree.	5.0	One of the more surreal films	2000-01-19	11	9	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A13STKDYQO5DQ8	"S. Hebbron ""S B H."""	A stylistic, glorious and beautiful adaptation of much favoured Dahl book. The Eastern Europe mystic locations add to the magical, old world feel and charm of the story. The children are multi-national are perfectly cast, just as in the book, and bring with them the deadly sin range of glaring faults, greed, covertness, arrogance and fibs a plenty!The one difference being Veruca Salt's commuppance, in the back she falls down a shoot for  bad shelled nuts, being shelled by Squirrels. These are replaced by Geese and golden eggs in the film, the shoot being for bad eggs, a more obvious visual analgy and Geese were perhaps easier to film than Squirrels! Each naughty childs end in the story is punctuated by the wonderful Oompah Loompahs morals to music.What really sets this film apart is Wilder's playing of the dotty and slightly sinister Wonka. He is the perfect mix of sweet hearted Gentleman and screwball lunatic.Generally a heart warming film which spares you none of Dahl's trademark moralising. It will be interesting to see if the 2005 version is comparable, somehow I don't think Depp has the range to give us a bipolar mix of kind hearted sweetness and cruel eccentricity in way Wilder manages with near imperceptable accuracy here.	5.0	Tooth rottingly delicious!	2005-07-18	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1XEFHQZP8Y35W	Silver Screen	"""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is one of those rare films that bridges the child-adult film gap.  Persons of all ages can watch, eyes wide, and revel in Willy Wonka's eccentricities and Charlie's inate goodness and splendid luck.  The film, more than 30 years old, hardly feels its age.  Made in a time before computerized special effects, the relative cheese quotient only serves to make the film that much more charming.Gene Wilder is superbly cast as the unconvential confectioner, Willy Wonka, who is partial to brightly colored leisure suits, large hats and not averse to breaking into song when the moment requires it.  Rather than being simply odd and borderline unsettling as Johnny Depp would portray him three decades later, Wilder's Wonka is obviously an overgrown kid himself, a person who truly enjoys making candy and making people smile.  There is not a hint of any darkness hiding behind those dancing eyes.The children are all marvelously cast, each one befitting their character's physical description on Roald Dante's classic book.  Despite hating seeing them go, their individual come-uppances are rewarding and indulging.  The parents have very little to do, other than watch their respective children get into trouble, bemoan the fact and watch the Mystic-Tanned Oompa Loompas break into early karaoke about it.Watching this movie reminds me of what is so fun about being a child - - the innocence involved in believing that such a place as the Wonka Factory can exist, and the good kid (Charlie) comes out on top in the end, while the bad kids go home empty-handed and having learned their lesson.""Willy Wonka"" is good, clean fun for the whole family, with catchy lyrics provided by the Oompa Loompas to boot.  Pop it in, break out some chocolate bars or gobstoppers and enjoy!"	5.0	A Child's Paradise	2006-08-30	4	2	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2QQHIY23PL7H3	Simon	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is still a classic of a movie after all these years, with memorable songs, acting, and special effects that continue to hold up well. The Tim Burton remake is coming soon, and no matter how well its received, I hope no one forgets the original.Try and purchase the widescreen version of the movie if you can, which actually is a matte of the fullscreen version that crops the top and bottom, but is truer to the director's vision and covers up some of the special effects techniques (such as the hose for Violet's blueberry effect). Both discs contain some good special features, including a commentary and documentary that reunites all five Wonka kids. There's not a lot here compared to newer releases, but the quality of the retrospective is -wait for it- worth its weight in chocolate.A must-own family movie, and a great movie to watch before seeing the remake.	5.0	Still tasty	2005-07-13	4	4	0

I loved this film as a kid from the very first time I saw it in a theater, and that love has not diminished one bit in the 40-odd years since.  This movie is an all-time classic.It's a beautiful fantasy tale of mystery and wonder, of wildest dreams coming true, of adventure, with the clear moral that honesty, truth and humility will always stand you in good stead.  That, and imagination is only as real as you choose for it to be, whether an adult or a child.  A beautiful, lyrical, magical film for adults and children alike.  And it's fun to sing along with, too.My 3-year-old son loves this movie. He can't yet explain why, and it really doesn't matter. It's got candy, outrageous and colorful (literally) characters, fantastic sets, song and dance, and every now and then goes seriously surreal, strange, and downright creepy.Superior entertainment, with a valuable, positive, and stealthy character-developing message.	4.0	Timeless, Even if You Don't Like Candy	2001-05-07	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	Negative comparisions to the Roald Dahl text notwithstanding, &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is the last really great movie musical.  It's miles beyond the motion-sickness-inducing &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; or the thighs-in-your-face &quot;Chicago&quot; and has the charm to delight even the least imaginative of us.  The beauty of the film is how well it balances adult cynicism with youthful hope--Dahl's satirical subtexts of European colonialism and slavery (as witnessed by the greed of just about everyone involved and the predicament of the Oopah Loompahs, respectively) are virtually indetectable for children wowed by the colorful production design and memorable songs.  So are the swipes against the Germans, common in British films.  But the core of the story revolves around Charlie Bucket, the poor but kind-hearted boy whose bleak life with his struggling single mother and invalid grandparents is punctuated only by the occasional ray of sunshine.  That he finds the last ticket to compete for a lifetime supply of chocolate is deserved; that he wins against a gaggle of spoiled, obnoxious children that represent the worst of humanity is inevitable.  Peter Ostrum and Jack Albertson are terrific as Charlie and Grandpa Joe, respectively, and Gene Wilder inhabits the wily but world-weary Wonka wonderfully.  Children (and some adults) sometimes becry the darkness of some scenes, as well as Wilder's often biting reactions to them, but they miss the point:  Wonka seeks genuine kindness and decency in a landscape populated mostly by avarice and deceit.  To find an heir that possesses such qualities, he must present both the beautiful and the ugly, and act both the benefactor and the villain.  It is only through witnessing their reactions--and the rotten kids are never put off by the horrible things they see and do--that he can discover which of them deserves to inherit his fortune.  Great songs and uncomplicated special effects add to the air of fantasy that makes this film a winner.	5.0	Still Great After 30 Years	2004-05-16	1	1	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A12A8LU93A132U	Steve	This is my favorite children's film next to 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. I won't review the film because enough people have. Therefore, I'll just review the DVD. The picture was very bright and clear on my TV. The picture was much better than a lot of newer movies I have on DVD. The sound was adequate, but I don't have a fancy sound system hooked up. The film I thought would make for great bonus materials such as commentary and a documentary, it has neither. Two trailers are included, the original trailer and an 25th anniversary trailer. They are both fairly the same except the newer one's image is better. Some production notes on the making are very short consisting of one page of text for things such as location, crew, screenplay etc. The cast/crew notes are also very short. I would bet since this is out-of-print they are producing a special edition version DVD of this film. It would certainly be worth it.	5.0	A DVD review	2000-12-03	6	3	3

Though Johnny Depp was OK albeit more than a bit creepy in the 2005 movie, Gene Wilder will always be the only Willy Wonka for me.  Sure the movie is a bit dated in regards to a 70's look and no modern special effects but does it really matter?  This book is so true to Dahl's original children's book and the songs, characters and sets match up exactly to what I envision when I read it.  I love Jack Albertson as Grandpa too.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A23Q1T4MXZHFM7	susumu-5	I saw the film after seeing Tim Burton version in 2005, and I really enjoyed this 1971 version starring GENE WILDER.Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka is really witty and performing the role of the legendary chocolate bar factory owner brilliantly. The first appearance with somersault which is the Wilder's own idea, tells the Wilder's sense of humor quite well. Wonka is an old man in the book but Wilder was still in his 30s. Wilder wants to stress that the book and the film is different? Punishments of the naughty kids are done really well and its lesson can be seen a lot more clearly than the 2005 version. And what is impressive is that the invited children as well as adults truly enjoy the fantastic garden compensating for a bit poorly designed sets. Another factor making the storyline quite convincing is that even Charlie shares the mistakes by tasting the body-floating candies. The process by which the Charlie wins the factory is well described and quite impressive.Wilder's Wonka is by no means true to the original book but the appealing one for sure.Verdict: Compromise the sets and outdated F/X and you may feel like being one of the luckiest kids or their accomapanying adults.Rating: 88 out of 100Recommended for: Classic movies fans and fantasy novels fans.	4.0	Well-Witted, and Well Performed	2009-04-18	1	1	0

While a lot of people say that the movie is great fun they often don't mention the very serious commentary the movie (and the book for that matter) makes about economic classes, television, junk food, and huge egos.  The special effects are still pretty cool today and the movie still can make your heart race or your eyes tear up at times.  The dialog and music are cleverly done; Gene Wilder's acting is wonderful in this film.  I probably won't let a small child watch this, but almost everyone else should enjoy it.

My one complaint is a ""psychedelic"" scene after the chocolate river encounter when the remaining children take a scary ride on a boat down the river. There are frightening images (chicken getting its head cut off, weird man with snake? crawling over his face) that seem to have zero to do with the plot of the film.

The quality is clear, the movie runs fine, even the documentaries on it are good.  But (and there is always a but) some of the options dont work, like the Sing-along song section is only a couple of the songs, and the oompa-loopa song doesnt let you see the words (as the others do).  The navigation is not designed as nicely as it could have been.  I had been hearing about this for a while and was slightly disappointed when I finally saw the finished product.  Hence only 4 stars.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	ADB8XCKNSDY5Z	theboombody	A film for children?  Maybe.  But you can't deny that this is a great film none-the-less.  It's tough to stay true to an author's vision when converting from a novel format to a movie format, but I believe this film has done so successfully.What makes this film stand out is its imagination.  It doesn't skimp on crazy, unexplainable happenings at any point.  It never sacrifices imagination in order to be convincing, and somehow this works, and works well.  The many wonderful musical numbers in the movie work well too.After watching this as a kid, you wish that a place like the chocolate factory actually existed.  It's a wonderful dreamy illusion.Chances are you know the movie, but it's still good to watch from time to time.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AN3V81A6V576	The Nurbler	"I love the movie, packaging, and everything about this .. except the reported list price and savings.  Amazon shows the list price (as of Jan 12, 2012) at $64.98 with a savings of $36.99, which sounds great.  However, Warner Home Video (the folks who made and released this product) currently lists this at $39.99.  If the savings Amazon listed were true, this would cost a mere $3.00, which would be quite a bargain indeed!  When questioned about this, Amazon admitted that I could find different prices for their products elsewhere.  That's it.  They never acknowledge their somewhat deceptive practice of showing ""list"" prices that are sometimes significantly higher than reality, thus making their prices look like a great savings, even when they might be higher than other places (and once, higher than the actual list price of a product!)Sorry for putting this here, but Amazon hasn't seemed to care when I sent them questions about this, so I felt compelled to share to ensure that others are watching for this, too."	5.0	What's up Amazon?	2012-01-12	14	11	3

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AT7W1EXT0PF2Y	The Patriarch	"Ahh...The good ol' days. The Patriarch remembers fondly the days of his youth when he was forced to watch this film in his local Thought-Control-and-Processing-Center to wit I mean public school.The first strikingly strange thing about this movie is the fact that it takes place in no specific time period. I mean, it was made in `71, it has 60s/70s and slang, modern automobiles, and yet Charlie's family lives like 19th century proletariat laborers. They live in a one room shack where all four grandparents live in a communal bed, the mom works in a sweat-shop laundry, and they all dress like chimney sweeps. It looks like they use the same sets and wardrobe from Oliver, which they probably did.If you're still awake after the somniferous credit sequence then you'll get to witness a frightening 1920s era candyman/soda jerk. These obviously no longer existed in the early seventies, so it only brings up more questions about the era this movie takes place in. The scary bachelor candyman now throws candy at the kids and gives them the run of the place. I fail to see how this will help his profits. He sings the children the first song of the film, the aptly-titled Candyman. Looking in the window in silent reproach is Charlie Bucket. (NOT pronounced `bouquet')Charlie always has this look on his face like he just watched his dog get hit by a truck and dragged down the street. Of course if you lived like Charlie, wouldn't you? An unusual glimmer of hope enters Charlie's life when eccentric, reclusive Candy maker Willy Wonka holds a contest to give five lucky winners a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Don't ask how much a lifetime supply of chocolate is, since chocolate is not needed to support human life it may very well be 0 bars of chocolate. The bigger question is just how winning this contest would help Charlie's miserable life get any better. It seems the logical course of action would be to sell the golden ticket to an eccentric millionaire.Wonka-fever grips the world, the first winner is a family of German stereotypes, the Gloops. The Gloops will eat anything including microphones!!! Oh well, when your country stages a failed world conquest it just goes with the territory. Winner #2 is rich heiress and spoiled brat Veruca Salt. Veruca's father has his whole plant ripping up Wonka bars in order to find the ticket. Just why he has a 1940s era sweatshop is a mystery. Winner #3 is Violet Beauregard and her father used car salesman Sam B. She's a plump loud mouth that is a self-proclaimed gum chewer. Meanwhile Charlie's mother has the nerve to sing this song, Cheer Up Charlie to him. Yeah, cheer up, Charlie, you've got a big bowl of cabbage-water coming to you when you get home. Winner #4 is Mike Teevee who, ironically enough, is obsessed with TV. He's watching a colour TV so I guess this movie takes place in the same time period as it was filmed, it's best just to ignore all the glaring anachronisms.Charlie opens a few Wonka bars only to have what little hope remained in his Pollyanna optimism crushed; but, a little sewer-grate picking scores Charlie an unidentifiable amount of money that he blows on more Wonka bars, even though the contest is supposedly over. Yeah, blow your money on candy Charlie, we don't mind eating cabbage water for another month. He picks up one just for Grandpa Joe, a good deed which is rewarded with the final golden ticket. The factory tour is, conveniently enough, held the next day. So Charlie and Grandpa Joe put on their Sunday best and head out to the factory where they are greeted by Wonka.Wonka is insane.His factory is a sadistic funhouse that is all one inside joke for Wonka's unhealthy amusement. Speaking of inside jokes, nearly everything he says is an inside joke, usually a quote from an obscure piece of literature. After a little psychological torture, Wonka lets them in to this open garden area where everything is `eatable.' Here we're introduced to the Oompa Loompas, an evil race of singing, know-it-all midgets. In this area we have our first causality, Augustus Gloop. He accidentally falls into the chocolate river and only Charlie tries to save him. Wonka is too concerned with the cleanliness of his chocolate river. He must not be too concerned as he sails a boat, the Wonkatania, through it in the next scene!Wonka takes them through a tunnel in the Wonkatania that can somehow emulate the effects of acid. Wonka has the boat go hundreds of miles per hour as he rants on like a madman, all for his own twisted amusement. In the next room Wonka throws a bunch of foreign objects into his candy vats, such as a pair of tennis shoes, a winter coat, and an alarm clock. Here Wonka introduces his chewing gum that tastes like a full course meal. While I don't find the idea of chewing gum that tastes like lamb gravy appetizing, to each his own. Violet, the gum chewer of the bunch takes a piece without permission and is turned into a blueberry. According to the Oompa Loompa's song, her only sin is gum chewing. Is that really that bad a thing?Now Wonka leads the remaining unsuspecting children to a room with geese that lay golden eggs. Veruca decides she has to have one. She's wanted everything she's seen so far, but she just HAS to have one of these. So much so that she goes into song in which she expounds upon her unfettered avarice. And uses some darn interesting words to do so.""I want a feast/I want a bean-feast(?)/Cream buns and donuts and fruitcake with no nuts So good you could go nuts/I want a ball/ I want a party/Pink macaroons and a million balloons And performing baboons(!?)/ and give it to me Now!/I want the world/I want the whole world/I want to lock it all up in my pocket it's my bar of chocolate/Give it to me now!/I want today/I want tomorrow/I want to wear them like braids in my hair(??) And I DON'T WANT TO SHARE THEM!!!*She struggles to regain her composureI want a party with roomfuls of laughter /10,000 tons of ice-cream/And if I don't get the things that I'm after/ I'm going to screeeeeaaaaam!!!""And with that she goes on a rampage mussing up Wonka's factory before finally falling down the garbage shoot. I think Veruca actually had the right idea. She's like Donald Trump only young, a girl, and with good hair. In a world of Paris Hiltons, here is an heiress that wants to make herself more rich instead of just having s e x with everybody and driving drunk. And can you imagine Veruca going on some silly photo-op journey to Africa to help the less fortunate? Of course not!As the movie draws closer to its end, I think now is a good time to contemplate the message of our dear fable...Do not cross Wonka! As a matter of fact if you ever encounter a man in a full length purple coat, top hat, and cane, run! Just run! What he's selling may look good on the outside, but on the inside the sweet candy is rotten and filled with all kinds of sickly critters.

The retrospective documentary has a lot of ""Where are they now"" material, including the fact that most of the kids didn't act professionally after the movie. The one playing Augustus Gloop seems to think that he was cast because he was a sweet kid - even though he was supposed to be an obnoxious brat.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1AQVXJF8AEDYV	TK James	"I saw the movie four times as a boy around Charlie's age, but as an adult it's obvious now that the movie is a little campy (a dark comedy that's also a musical?); a little cheesey (they didn't bust the budget on sets); and a little kitschy.It's Wilder's Wonka, though not entirely true to the book, that makes the movie.  He appealed to me as a child and still does as an adult.  He's a mixture of strong emotional attractions and strong dangers.  As an adult, you can appreciate the mixture more.  He has obvious depth, maybe even with a dash of melancholy.  He can be whimiscal at one moment (putting an overcoat into a vat of candy because the candy was too cold) and then quote Shakespeare the next (""Where is fancy bred...?).  You can imagine Johnny Depp's Wonka putting the overcoat into the vat of candy, but you can't imagine him quoting Shakespeare.For young children, even though the movie is rated G, my advice would be that if a child is too young to read Dahl's book, then the movie probably isn't for him or her.  The ""scarry"" things in the movie happen for a reason, and they're supposed to make the children watching think.As for adults, ""A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men."""	3.0	A Little Nonsense Now and Then...	2006-06-29	2	1	1

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) is a classic movie, in that it depicts the fact that dreams can come true. The story is seen through the eyes of Charlie Bucket, a boy from a poor family who has a big heart, and is respectful of people, and appreciative of everything he gets. Gene Wilder was a good choice to play Willie Wonka, and gives a stellar performance. For being over 40 years old, this film has held up well in preservation and remastering; expect good picture and sound quality. It's an impressive movie for a relatively low budget.

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AFJ6ZVBQG4LRK	Too Cold in Madison	...hence the 3 stars.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my two favorite books as a single-digit kid back in the late '60s. (James and the Giant Peach was the other.) I had high expectations of the film when I saw it in a theater at the age of 12. I was rather disappointed for several reasons.The first flaw is that they changed it too much from the book. As an adult, I can understand using geese instead of squirrels because live geese were probable easier to deal with than live squirrels back before CG. But having Charlie and Grandpa Joe drink the bubbly against the rules is inexcusable. My best guess as to why is that self-indulgent, moral-relativist Hollywood types could not abide a child who would actually behave well all through a visit to a candy factory.The other thing that I really hated though was Gen Wilder's over-the-top screaming temper tantrum over the issue. It really stunned and traumatized me at the age of 11, having read the book at least ten times and knowing that Willy Wonka would never do such a thing.5 stars for production values, 1 star for the egregious intentional flaws = 3 stars overall.	3.0	I am of 2 Minds on This One...	2007-04-07	6	1	5

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1XOQOW2HJSOIV	"Trekkintheplains ""Take a sad song and make it..."	"Yeah, yeah, so the enormously talented and amazingly HOT Johnny Depp did a new version of the novel this movie is based on titled ""CHARLIE and the Chocolate Factory"".  Well, I find it creepy and too modernized.THIS is THE Willy Wonka!  Gene Wilder is unbeatable as the quirky, engaging, singing, hermitic, clinically insane candymaker extraordinaire.  These oompa-loompas with their green hair, orange faces and clotheshanger-in-the-pants uniforms are the only way to go.  And the singing, the routines, it's fantastic!  I personally enjoy the colors and the 70's filming techniques used to make this movie.  Anyone who was a child in the last 30-some years had to have grown up singing ""oompa-loompa, doompa-de-doo, I've got another puzzle for you..."" and delighting in the sounds, sights, colors and over-the-top acting of all the brat children.Everything from the room that gets smaller at one end, to the boatride, even down to the moving-hand coathangers is bright and cheerful even when it's utterly terrifying.  And, there are no CG effects to spoil the atmosphere.  Face it, the CG in the newer movie is STILL not good enough to be convincing.  When you know they were just in front of a greenscreen, the movie is not the same.  This movie is authentically cool and nostalgically cheesy in some parts and all the more endearing because of it.  Willy Wonka belongs to the time of films when most everything was made by hand and children's films were - at heart - sweet, endearing, family-oriented affairs.  Some of my friends and I (we're in our 20's by the way) want to know what happened to such movies as ""Willy Wonka"", ""Hook"", and the wonderful, hand-drawn illustrations from films even as recently as ""The Little Mermaid"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"" - I grew up on these and am sad everything is so CG and driven by extraordinarily cheap, vulgar humor.  And what about fantastically done versions of classic books such as ""Black Beauty"" ""The Secret Garden"" and ""The Little Princess""?  I grew up on those as well and loved them dearly.  Or others, like ""The Sandlot"" and ""Angels in the Outfield"" - where are these movies today?  Why aren't these sorts being made still?Take my advice - classics like ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" are the kind of movies we need to keep showing our kids, and watching ourselves if only to be reminded what a truly classic children's movie ought to be."	5.0	Childhood Favorite for SURE	2008-06-08	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A26HDM444XEZ8J	Ummm no	Don't let the star rating fool you. Despite this movie having an absurd plot,  largely unlikable characters, particularly Charlie's family, and repetitive singing from the loompas, this is a fantastic movie. But wilder and the boy who plays charlie are the ones who really makes this movie a classic. ill leave the explanation of whats in this movie to the editors and other reviewers.the reason for the 1 star deduction is because of the transfer quality. some scenes are quite bad. such as the sketchiness of when charlie runs home after finding the golden ticket. since its been ages since i've last seen this movie i have no idea if anything was removed.Overall, this is a good buy. They're are interviews with cast and directors included on this too which makes even more valuable.	4.0	Wilder makes this movie worth it.	2007-06-26	4	4	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A3T8QNAEQ4SW7R	Vain Saints	The funny thing is that the bad reviewers can't get over how demented the film is, and that's why I like it.  It's why I liked it since I was a kid.  I never particularly cared about whether or not Violet or Verruca survived their ordeals; and in fact, I consider it a cop-out that Wonka had to reassure Charlie about the welfare of the other kids.  (But I guess it was necessary to preserve the character of Charlie as a genuinely caring person.)  The psychotic Chocolate River scene is probably my favorite in the movie.Some things I'd like to add.  I love how the film is set in a sort of no-place.  It's not England (Grandpa and Charlie are not English--nor are their families) but it's not America (Charlie's schoolteacher is English, but the students are not--Wonka isn't but the Candy vendor is).  It's set in contemporary no-place according to the cars, but life there is nothing like 1970s urban life.  There seems to be little crime, no bureaucracy (the only gov. worker is the local teacher) and no significant welfare state.  It's the bourgeoisie of the 1970s Anglosphere that never existed.  I love how Wonka is some kind of bizarre candy-making uber-mench who gets to decide the laws of physics in his candy universe and who is not accountable to any authority.  (The Oompah-Loompas are probably brainwashing the parents of the bad kids into confessing the murder of their own children as we speak.) Yet, I love how the film, in spite of all this, believes in truth and meaning.  In no universe can the bad kids be anything but bad; and in no universe can Charlie not deserve his prize.One of my 3 favorite films of all-time.  Far better than the book.	5.0	Hilariously Twisted	2009-02-06	0	0	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was my favorite book as a child, this movie remains a favorite of mine even to this day.This film was made back in 1971 and is very simple in its style. The special effects are see-through and campy but the story line is a facinating metaphor for life that is forever timeless in its message. Willy Wonka is the creative genius who becomes a recluse in his chocolate factory because of society and its greed and malice. But he never loses his belief that someone in the world exists who can still believe in imagination and dreams. He finds this person in Charlie, a poor child who lives with his mother and four grandparents in a dirty basement home. Charlie has every reason to become dispirited and negative yet he remains a shining light of great positivity regardless of his circumstances. I suspect his attitude comes from the fact that his Grandfather Joe always supports his dreams, the boy never has to hear the word &quot;can't&quot;!The chocolate factory holds a contest and several children, including Charlie, get invited behind the doors with Willy Wonka. While on tour they are tested with fame, fortune, greed and honesty until one by one they succumb to the failure of a human heart. All except Charlie, who keeps a smile on his face and wonder in his eyes while being faced with the simple adversities that cause the other children to fail. Sadly I feel the parents are to blame creating children who thrive on material wealth, constant TV watching, gorging on food, and looking for constant attention. The parents of the children who fail refuse to believe in the dream of Willy Wonka surrounding the atomsphere with doubt and negative beliefs. How could anyone survive under such circumstances?The Chocolate Factory is filled with wonder, color and silly songs. Regardless of your age it will satisfy your sweet tooth and fill even a hardened heart. It certainly brings to life how parent's affect their children with their own actions and attitudes. Telling a child they &quot;can't&quot; accomplish all that they imagine only assists in stopping the world from greatness. Don't be afraid to dream!	5.0	A Great Metaphor for Life	2004-06-15	4	2	2

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A1JQIAVH9GNDL3	Wayne B. Geschke	I have always found this movie as a very uplifting movie. It makes me feel good everytime I watch it. Put yourself in the childs mind. Don't be critical of it. I can find some flaws (like when Grampa Joe gives Charlie a Wonka bar-about 15 minutes into the movie ) which isn't really the type of Wonka bar which would contain the golden ticket (because it is too thick-the Wonkas are thinner, like a Hersheys bar). By the way, my son brought that flaw to my attention. But please overlook such things. View the movie as a child that DREAMS. We have all had dreams. Please don't be critical and just enjoy the movie. There's lots of comedy in the movie and messages for children that don't act as well as we would like them to.Wayne GeschkeI hope this is helpful to you.	5.0	Enjoy this video as if you were a young child viewing it.	2004-02-22	2	2	0

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A2LDHJSP3Y6D9Q	"Whodathotit ""whodathotit"""	Well, not exactly... Some here have complained that the widescreen version is simply a matted version of a full screen print, and that the widescreen presentation chops off part of the image at the top and bottom. Well, according to my copy of the DVD, that is only half correct. I own the 25th Anniversary 1996 release of this film on DVD, which has both the widescreen and full screen version on one DVD. I compared numerous scenes in freeze-frame between the widescreen and full screen versions. In widescreen, sure enough, a bit of the top and bottom of the image seems to be cut off when compared to the full screen version. But I also noticed that when viewing the full screen version, an equal bit is missing from the left and right compared to the widescreen version. So no matter which version you watch, you aren't seeing &quot;everything&quot;. But which is proper? After comparing many images, I conclude that the widescreen version is what we are supposed to be seeing. Consider the beginning of chapter six. If you watch the widescreen version, you see a news anchor sitting at a desk. the bottom of the image is framed with his name plate on his desk, and the right side of the screen says &quot;Evening Report&quot; on the back wall. Watch the full screen version, and you will see a bit more blue background on the top, and more of the desk below the name plate on the bottom, but the right side of the image now reads, &quot;Eveni Repo&quot;! Folks, you ARE missing the left and right sides when viewing the full screen version, and from what I saw, the little bit of information that is missing from the top and bottom of the widescreen version generally was inconsequential. Every scene I watched and compared looked better composed when watching the widescreen presentation. Just FYI...	4.0	Widescreen ... fullscreen ... Guess what? Everybody's WRONG!	2003-01-21	56	50	6

Colors are vibrant, edges are sharp and crisp, and there is very little dirt on the print - amazing considering the film is over 30 years old. Bonus features include a commentary by all of the kids in the film who went back and watched the film 30 years later (should be the same commentary as the DVD version released a couple of years back), as well as a few other bonus featurs (all in 480, of course)So, why did it not get a higher rating? Right out of the package, I had a place in the bonus features where the audio and video suddenly became extreamely pixelated, broke up, and when it started back up - 20 seconds later on the running time on the front of the player, and the audio and video were off sync. This means one of two things - the disc does not have an anti-scratch coating (not required on HD-DVDs, but I have never had a scratch on a new disc freash out of the package), or a flaw in the manufactoring process (possibly a layer transition?) Luckely it was just in the bonus features - I would have been furious if it was in the main movie.	3.0	Beautiful HD transfer	2008-04-05	2	2	0

It was darker than anything I had seen to that point in a children's movie. However, my feelings about if have changed, especially my appreciation of Gene Wilder (even more after seeing Johnny Depp's decidedly 'weird' take on Willy Wonka - I can't believe that people buy that version for their children). But there are many fans of this movie. My review is about this box of goodies. The movie in blu-ray is spectacular - unbelievably restored after so many years. The box of scratch and sniff pencils and eraser is something I think many children would enjoy. I liked the book ""Pure Imagination"" by Mel Stuart, the director, and read it as soon as I opened the box. The gold ticket is a fun addition. I also enjoyed the features and seeing the children grown up. The box is sturdy and everything is wrapped well to protect it. I sent one to my grown daughter and one to my granddaughter for birthday gifts. One I kept for myself. This set is highly recommended."	5.0	nice keepsake for fans	2012-01-18	0	0	0
6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	A295P2KZIWUAWI	"W. Langan ""take403"""	Last Sunday, a friend told me this movie was on TV and I stopped what I was doing to watch it on TV!  Sure, I had seen it almost 100 times, even on the big screen when it 1st came out (I was about 4 and terrified by the boat scene!).  I see this video is currently out of stock.  Hopefully, after this past weekend, there'll be more demand for a reissue!Gene Wilder does an excellent job as Willy Wonka, the candy-making genius.  At one moment, he's overly calm and cynical, and the next moment, he's roaring with emotion!  Peter Ostrum plays Charlie Bucket, the friendly, obedient little boy who can barely afford a Wonka bar, and Jack Albertson (Chico and the Man) plays Grandpa Joe, who tells Charlie stories about Willy Wonka's candy factory.  Against impossible odds, Charlie wins the last of the Golden Tickets (which entitles him and Grandpa Joe to a visit to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate).  Charlie is already warned about the evil Mr. Slugworth and resists his lures.  The other 4 children disobey Mr. Wonka and pay the consequences- in unusual and hilarious ways!  There's Augstus Gloop, a little glutton.  Then there's the spoiled, greedy Veruca Salt (there are few things in the world she doesn't want!).  Next, there's the boorish, gumchewing Violet Beauregard.  Finally, there's the junior couch potato Mike Tevee (who spends endless hours watching TV).  And let's not forget the Oompa Loompas who run the factory and sing jingles warning the audience not to get in trouble like Augustus, Violet, Veruca, and Mike.All in all, a cleverly done movie which isn't just for children and teaches lessons about obedience and humility.  Who can resist the candy-coated muchrooms, the fizzy-lift drinks, or the exploding candy to save for your enemies?  Also charming are the songs &quot;I've Got a Golden Ticket&quot; and &quot;Pure Imagination&quot;.	5.0	Pure Imagination!	2001-01-23	6	5	1

6304176287	Willy Wonka &amp; Chocolate Factory [VHS]	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	This is a movie that every child born thirty to forty years ago will remember growing up with. A frequent objection bandied about by critics is that the movie makes no sense to children. On the contrary, I have found that the film's enchantment is almost universal (I have spoken to many who, like me, spent their childhood under Wonka's spell; I also don't recall speaking to a single person who didn't enjoy it). With that in mind, I find it hard to criticize; nevertheless, I'll make a noble attempt.The film has a few differences with the original book by Roald Dahl. The setting now appears to be America, rather than England (though it was filmed on location in an amusingly ill-disguised Bavaria). In the original book, Charlie had both mother and father; in the film his father is deceased before the story begins. This is not an arbitrary change, however. A thread that runs through the film is Charlie's need for a father (a male to fulfil his dreams and fantastical aspirations) and, just as importantly, Wonka's need for a son and heir. Here is an added dimension that builds nicely on Dahl's initial story.The film exhibits a few disturbing inconsistencies at the same time, however. One crucial blunder, that threatens to tear the narrative fabric apart at the seams, is the addition of a scene in which Charlie and Grandpa Joe explicitly disobey Wonka's instructions by tasting the fizzy-lifting drink, which has almost disastrous consequences for the pair. What, then, makes Charlie's actions qualitatively different to the other childrens'? When the entire plot hinges on Charlie's good character, next to the brazenly brattish and ignorant demeanour of his peers, this slip could easily prove fatal. It is not sufficient that Charlie is given the chance to redeem himself later on in the film, for this is an opportunity the other children simply did not have. It makes Charlie's subsequent dismay over the other children's behaviour ('Why don't they listen to Mr Wonka?' he asks his grandfather) a little incredulous. What saves it is the fact that most people will probably not notice this error, since the rest of the film is at pains to set Charlie apart from the other characters, so the incident is more likely to be taken as the result of misguided curiosity, rather than juvenile insolence or malice.Another error, with similar consequences for the story, is in the creation of a new character, Mr Wilson, an assistant to Mr Wonka. Though the character does play a significant part in the story, it is a role that would have been much better being fulfilled by some other plot device, since it is introduced only at great expense to the overall cohesion of the plot. In the creation of a world (Wonka's factory) unpolluted (ostensibly!) by greed, selfishness and worldly cynicism, ie. the influence of grown-ups, we have yet another central element on which the whole narrative hangs, thematically. The new character only serves as a badly-judged novelty that clashes woefully with the tenor of the rest of the picture. (The reason the character of Wonka is no hindrance, incidentally, is that his character is clearly neither child nor grown-up, per se, but belongs to the realm of fantasy, something which Wilson's character does not; indeed, if they had made Wilson's character more fantastical, it probably wouldn't have been convincing).There are a few other potentially worrying holes. For example, the aura of enchantment and magic surrounding the world of candy and chocolate, summed up in the rather hummable Candyman number (one of a few good songs; though there are also one or two real clangers), is offset by the fact that this is an enchantment and magic that only rich kids can afford. Charlie watches on enviously as those who can afford it taste of the delights of Wonka chocolate, whilst the Candyman ('He mixes [candy] with love and makes the world taste good') presumably passes Charlie by on account of his poverty. I won't go so far as to call this capitalist propaganda (!), but it is certainly an example of another glaring inconsistency.So, with all this in mind, what makes this such a great movie? It is imaginative and inventive. The production design certainly has a few technical flaws, but it is fun, original and captivating. The characters (from the mind of one of the 20th century's greatest storytellers) are pitched straight for the child in every one of us, regardless of age. It is funny and exciting, an involving fairytale that appeals to our sense of fantasy, curiosity and adventure. It is a minor classic that has become a part of generations of children and grown-ups. That tells me that, despite its flaws, it works. I heartily recommend it. Enjoy.	4.0	Minor classic	2002-05-11	11	5	6

I love all the characters in Willy Wonka.  My favourite one is Veruka Salt.  I hate to say this but she sort of reminds me of myself when I was her age.  I WANT IT NOW!!!!!  I also think Gene Wilder played his character brilliantly.  This film has alot of heart and has some important lessons infused with the plot.
