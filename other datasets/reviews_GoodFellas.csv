0790729725	GoodFellas	AZ1VJW1GBHCE5	7DogNight	I usually enjoy De Niro - and he gave a good performance in this movie.  But the story line told of a group of people who have absolutely no class.  Plenty of money, hostility, and aggression, but totally lacking in civility.  The macho excessively ritualized manners were laughable.  If I wanted to be exposed to this I'd move to the Jersey Shores.  Really found it obnoxious.	2.0	Not to My Liking	2013-09-19	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	ABHKBHETXHSYR	Aaron (cisco1@slic.com)	An excellent way to ruin an INCREDIBLE movie is to put it on dvd and then make me have to get up and flip the damn thing halfway through.  I don't have to do that with The Deer Hunter which is 3hrs long.  I honestly think  that you ruin the whole feel of the movie in those few seconds.  And  finally isn't this the reason most of us avoided buying laserdisc players?	1.0	Goodfellas is a flipper, of all the rotten luck!!!!	1999-10-13	6	4	2

0790729725	GoodFellas	AAKGTWGAFT1LQ	A C SHIELDS	This is a film about the Mafia but there are other aspects that make it such a memorable film , such as being in a gang no matter what the cost and the demands of keeping up a certain lifestyle .Martin Scorcese takes you on a ride that is a little draining but the actors show you why that is . The people either burn out , go to jail or die .One could say that the moral of the film is that ' crime doesn't pay ' , but that would be too simplistic and there are more layers to the film .The commentaries are informative and the Special Edition is very welcome .Buy this version of the film to get a better perspective on the whole thing .	5.0	A cautionary tale and a modern urban horror film	2005-12-27	2	2	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A1N3VPXSAO87IB	A Customer	This is one of the best film's of the 90's and next to the godfather, the best mafia film ever. The dvd however leaves a lot be desired. number one you have to turn it over halfway thourgh the movie. they couldn't put the whole movie on one side this is riddiclious, i can atleast watch the vhs without intruption of turning it over. The  other problem is there are no features at all and that is pittiful for such a great film. Warner brother's please put this out in 2 disc special edtion, untill then I will stick to my vhs and recomend you do to.	1.0	horribile dvd, great film	2003-12-25	14	8	6

Will always be a mob classic. Some of Liotta's best work and any movie with De Niro and Pesci has to be good. If you don't like violence then look somewhere else.	4.0	Goodfellas DVD	2002-01-06	1	0	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2PLEQNAV61VC0	"A. Dennis ""skateboarding saved/ruined my life"""	I don't see the point in writing a long drawn out synopsis of the movie Goodfellas because if you haven't seen it then quite simply you're blowing it big time.One of the best movies ever created... EVER.The bonus features for the 2 disc special edition are great. Interviews with everyone involved from the production crew to all the main actors.Having the standard version of this movie on DVD is okay, but you can't call yourself a true fan of Goodfellas unless you own this edition.[trivia: Saul Bass is the designer who created the artwork for Goodfellas. He also came up with the opening titles, which are as important to the movie as the rest of it. Bass designed nearly ALL of Alfred Hitchcock's film posters (Vertigo, Rear Window, North by Northwest, The Birds, etc).]	5.0	a MUST have	2008-02-13	2	1	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A3P5DOF3JFQPGU	"Adolfo Guerrero ""elclassiko"""	This Special Edition is great. The movie itself is pefectly done and directed, also the cast is one of the best when it comes to mafia movies.There's just a little problem.....I don't know if is my DVD copy but at the scene where Jimmy(Robert Deniro), Henry(Ray Liotta) and Paul(Paul Sorvino) are together discussing about Henry's problems certainly a vertical line appears in the middle of the screen. I rewinded it to make sure it wasn't my t.v. but the line appeared again, like i said before maybe it was just my DVD copy. Other than that there's no problem.So those of you who enjoy mafia movies this one is definitely a must have on your collection....	5.0	A must for your mafia collection!	2007-03-30	2	1	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	AZSN1TO0JI87B	A. Estes	"As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. In fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to.The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film-makers. Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you remember one thing about ""Goodfellas,"" it may very well be Eric Clapton's ""Layla"" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.Without a doubt, ""Goodfellas"" is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best. From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later."	5.0	Timeless and epic, brutal and unflinching.	2009-08-26	1	0	1

This is the way the real mob works, with the guys on the streets, not the man at the top. Masterful performances by all involved. Lorraine Bracco is gorgeous in this movie. Joe Pesci is never going to be cast as anything other than the character he plays in this movie, a wise mouth gangster. Shows a balanced account of the good and the bad about the mob.	5.0	One of the best mob movie's ever	2007-03-12	2	1	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1EH2HFR3IK6M8	Albert Babayev	Martin Scorcese, one of the most talented directors of his generation, delivered what many believe to be the finest gangster movie of all time.  Good Fellas, produced by Irwin Winkler, grossed $48 million and followed  the troubled life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from the 1950s to the 1980s.  As an Irish-Italian American affected by the rough immigrant-gangster  society in which he is raised, Hill begins to favor the celebrity lifestyle  lived by the well-respected and powerful gangsters.  The film, which took  place in New York City, won numerous Academy Award nominations.  Joe Pesci,  who played the enraged Tommy Devito, walked away with the award for best  supporting actor.  Robert DeNiro added another astonishing performance to  his marvelous acting career by playing the respected, but hostile Jimmy  Conway.  Based on Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy, Scorcese's film  depicts the extremely dangerous, yet materialistically rewarding lifestyle  of gangsters.  He uses Hill to portray the typical, New York kid, born to  hard-working immigrant parents and demonstrates Hill as someone who simply  dreams to live the life of a wealthy, important, and well-respected  individual.  Scorcese also introduces the viewers to the deranged DeVito,  whose idea of being a gangster is more extreme than that of Hill's, as he  uses his power to become a sick, murdering maniac.  The director carries  out his agenda by portraying the somewhat chaste Hill and the psychopath  DeVito as close friends who eventually lose all that they had worked for.  Scorcese chose to punish Hill by taking away all of his materialistic  gains, which Hill has dishonestly obtained, and to smite DeVito in the  similar vengeful manner that DeVito had become accustomed to inflicting on  others.  Scorcese clearly depicts the growing wave of immigration as  he follows the lifestyles of the mighty and powerful Mafia crew in NYC.  The film describes the importance of such power in the gangsters'  lifestyles.  They receive the utmost respect from everybody, including the  politicians and wealthy business owners, and most disturbingly, destroy  anyone in their path.  The objective of gaining wealth, too, appealed to  many gangsters, as they believed that it was more rewarding to acquire  riches through stealing than through working the ordinary jobs available in  NYC.  Ethnicity played a vital role in the movie as well, as the film  represents the major differences between the different immigration groups.  The importance of being a true Italian, for example, was vital when it came  to the rules of &quot;being made,&quot; a promotion within the Mafia world.  Furthermore, Karen Hill (Loraine Bracco) and her Jewish friend proclaimed  their discomfort of dating both DeVito and Hill because both gangsters came  from non-Jewish origins.  The film, which many believe to be the  finest mob movie ever, feeds the viewer with adequate information about the  lives of gangsters. Good Fellas is surely disturbing at times, as the  violence quotient runs high; however, because the film is based on reality,  the viewer will walk away with a new perspective on gangsters and mafiosi  lifestyles.  The film also teaches the audience about the flow of  immigration and the tremendous impact it had on America then and even now.  Good Fellas displays the inability of the Italians to Americanize and,  instead,6 exhibits the affect that the Italians had over the American  society.  The viewers can detect that by bringing together the different  traditions and values, the immigrants shaped what we call the United States  today.  The film in all aspects is notably unequivocal and will continue to  progress in fame.	5.0	Film Review: Good Fellas	2000-04-24	1	1	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2JVWVE7UB7P3Z	Albert John Alvarez	This will go down as an all time favorite for anyone who likes De Niro and Joe P. as well as Ray L. the entire cast was perfect for this movie. The storyline never loses ground; the fact that its based on a true story is even more enlightening. But it does give you a very realistic view of gangland at its best. The period is very convincing except for one noticeable mistake which I caught, and I really hate that about myself; I always find little things that don't go in the movie. For this one, was the scene where they went from Ray's childhood to his adulthood that was supposed to be 1963 as an introduction, Ray looks to cool dressed in a grey shark skin suit with his foot on the bumper of a 1965 chev. Only thing I saw that I could not help but notice. Over all the film kills....	5.0	Gangsters for days	2013-06-25	0	0	0

This is one of the greatest mob movies of all time and it stands tall next to godfather 1 and 2 in quality and originality. Anyone who gives the film a one star review makes me sick. I agree, it is a pain to get up and flip the DVD in the middle of the movie, and the sound isn't great, but overall just having this spectacular movie in your dvd collection makes up for this error. 5 stars for the movie, and 3 for the DVD, (even though it really should be a 0).

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	Claimed by many as one of the greatest films of all time! The grestest movie of the 90's! And, one of Martin Scorses's best films to date! I have to say, I'm inclined to agree with ALL three statements. Martin Scorsese is one of the few filmmakers who has a true &quot;ear&quot; for dialogue. His movies have characters that are &quot;real&quot;. You know that the way the characters are portrayed in the film, is probably the way the &quot;real life&quot; characters act and speak. But this is something that has always been said about Scorsese. His talent for making characters that seem &quot;real&quot;. The screenplay written by Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese himslef, is truly Oscar worthy. The acting by Robert De Niro (&quot;Jimmy&quot; Conway), Ray Liotta (Henry Hill), Joe Pesci (We should all know by now, he won an Oscar for this role playing Tommy DeVito) Lorraine Bracco (Karen Hill), and Paul Sorvino (&quot;Paulie&quot; Cicero) is amazing to watch! Every detail about this film is perfect. This is a movie all movie fans have to watch. There really isn't to much more I can say that hasn't already been said by other reviewers.

Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino are equally superb in the parts they play too. Even the lesser characters and people in the background give it their all.  Truthfully, I didn't think this movie was all that violent. There's a few scences, but the main controversy is by far the language.  It moves along so nicely that you don't even really notice how long it is. The music fits perfectly with each and every scene.

But Joe Pesci stands out, his character is in my view is a picture of mob figures.  The viscious nature that he expresses is truly frightening.  But what is more telling is the fact that he sees nothing wrong with his actions.  These men seem to believe that their way on viewing life, is the only correct view.  The films ending shows the illusion that they have been living.In the end their lifestyle destroys them.  This movie is a must have, for anyone interested in crime dramas.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3QFFA0F7YMZTX	Amy Marchand Ventimiglia	Well as far as the movie itself goes it is my all time favorite. Its the best mob film ever and all the people who disagree and say the Godfather is does not appreciate the honesty of this movie. The Godfather is excellent but it is not Goodfellas. For one thing it is a true story and really exposes the sleezy side of the mob but it is also very cool. I have read Wiseguy by Nicholas Peliggi many times, from which this movie is based, but this is one instance where the movie is better than the book. Usually it is not that way. Martin Scorcese did a masterpiece in shooting this film. Just that long drawn out scene when Henry and Karen go into the restaurant the back way on their first date is just amazing because it is done in all one shot! The cast is amazing! In fact it was so amazing I guess that is why 7 of the actors have shown up in the best TV show of all time;The Sopranos, either as lead or supporting cast or extras! I can honestly say I have seen this movie well over 80 times, maybe a hundred and it is always entertaining. The dialogue, especially Joe Pesci's (Tommy) part is great. DeNiro (Jimmy the Gent) really shows why he is an all time favorite and Ray Liotta (Henry) is great as a newcomer which he was in this movie and I have always wondered why he didn't go on to great things after this. Obviously this was his role of a lifetime to date! This movie is a drama but it also has a lot of humor in it too. This movie is almost 15 years old but when you watch it you would never know it. Its so precise on detail it could have been made 6 months ago.The way Scorcese covers all 3 decades is awesome. He gets every single detail right with clothing, sets, and cars! The soundtrack fits as well and the soundtrack is awesome too!Now as far as the Special Edition DVD goes I really wish this DVD had a little more and now I have the original and now this as well as my OLD VHS!!  Although the picture quality is awesome and the movie will never be anything but, I think it could have been done a little better. I did enjoy the Henry Hill commentary and thats about it. The documentary where filmmakers gave their viewpoints I could care less about and the commentary with the cast is dated! All in all I rate this DVD a 4 and thats only because the movie makes up for the extras!	4.0	Cannot top this movie but the DVD extras are lacking	2005-01-18	4	2	2

0790729725	GoodFellas	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I'll admit that when I first saw `GoodFellas' I was less than impressed.  I didn't understand why so many hailed it as the best of Scorsese.  In fact, the first thirty minutes or so bored me to such an extent that I turned it off and went on the watch something else.I know now that I was an idiot.Martin Scorsese is known for his gritty gangster films (although I much prefer his films like `Taxi Driver' and `Raging Bull') and with that in mind one must come to an appreciation for `GoodFellas', which is in all honestly Scorsese's finest gangster film.  The opening sequence, with De Niro, Liotta and Pesci driving out into the woods with a body in the trunk of the car, is priceless; utterly priceless.  It classically captures the ruthlessness of these men in their aspirations of power, money and most of all, respect.`GoodFellas' tells the true story of Henry Hill, an Irish/Italian who rose up in the mafia ranks beginning in the 50's and carrying through to 1980 when he entered the witness protection program.  Beginning in his early teens, Hill desired so badly to be a gangster that he found himself running small errands for mob boss Paul Cicero, getting in his good graces.  By the time he was twenty-one Hill had made a good name for himself in the mob community and continued to make money for himself and for his boss, Paulie.  Hill meets and marries the beautiful Karen and begins to build a life for his newfound family that revolves around murder, extortion and drugs.But what goes up must come down.`GoodFellas' takes a little time to establish itself in the beginning (thus the reason that I wrote it off all those years ago when I first saw it) but once it finds its footing it takes off brilliantly.  I often see `GoodFellas' compared to `Casino', the large majority standing by `GoodFellas' as the superior film and yet a small yet sturdy group contesting that `Casino' is the finer film.  I used to belong to the `Casino' club, but after a recent viewing of both films I must conclude that `GoodFellas' is the stronger film in the end.  `Casino' is set up similarly yet it doesn't take as long to get into, and I think that's why I was initially on its side.  It flows from beginning to end without any low points but it also doesn't have really any major highs.  While `GoodFellas' gets off to a slow start, once it gets going it is flawless and its highs are enormously rewarding.The one facet of `GoodFellas' that is the strongest to me is the incredible performances by the entire cast, especially the four stars.  Ray Liotta delivers his finest performance to date as Henry Hill.  I am not a huge fan of Liotta, but his portrayal of wiseguy Hill is flawlessly accurate and dedicated.  He's matched by Robert De Niro who beautifully settles into supporting territory as Jimmy Conway.  It's nice to see a major star like De Niro allow another actor to take the limelight when you know that he could have easily devoured it for himself.  The two major standouts here are Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco though, two actors who come into their own in this film and deliver heartfelt and moving performances.  Pesci plays Tommy, the hotheaded gangster who often lets his anger override better judgment.  His performance is so natural and charismatic it feels as though he isn't even acting.  Bracco plays Karen, Hill's wife, and she does so with accurate and realistic intensity.  As she struggles to wrap her head around her husband's lifestyle, the drugs, money and women, she creates a woman who is understandable and sympathetic.Scorsese knows how to capture a mood, an era and most importantly, our interest.  He has delivered to us monumental classics and `GoodFellas' rests near the top as one of his finest contributions to American cinema.  `GoodFellas' is a smart and engaging film about the highs and lows of the gritty way of life, exposing the emotional and physical damage done to those that engage in this lifestyle.  If you find the opening scenes hard to get into I urge you to settle down, take a deep breath and wait it out, for once Scorsese hooks you he never lets you go.	5.0	Much better the second time around...	2008-06-24	5	5	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AE8RQHFMSLN0D	"Anthony Damato ""Law professor"""	GOODFELLAS invites comparison with the first two GODFATHER movies (forget  about Godfather Part 3!)  I found it more authentic than the GODFATHER, but  nowhere near as good a plot.  What was especially more authentic was the  fun that these criminals had as they whacked folks.  It made them far more  menacing.  The GODFATHER always struck me as so un-humorous as to be  unrealistic.  Marlon Brando set the tone with his over-lugubrious lead role  (badly thought out, I've always believed).  The result was that GODFATHER  is a kind of corporate movie--intrigue in the business world, except that  the business they are in is crime.  Of course, what makes GODFATHER 1 and 2  among the greatest movies of all time is the superb plots that grip you all  the way.  GOODFELLAS doesn't really have much of a plot, because it is  based on the true life confession of Henry Hill.  After seeing GOODFELLAS  (for the third time!) I read Nicholas Pileggi's WISE GUY, the book upon  which the movie was closely based.  If you've seen GOODFELLAS, by all means  read the book: it tells you more.  In addition, director Scorsese missed a  big bet: he ends the movie as a kind of cautionary tale--Hill winds up in a  dreary Federal witness protection program.  The real life story by Pileggi  has a much more satisfying ending, which is worth quoting in part:  &quot;Today Henry Hill and his wife live somewhere in America.  As of this  writing he has a successful business and lives in a $150,000 two-story  neocolonial house in an area with such a low crime rate that garden-shed  burglaries get headlines in the weekly press.  His children go to private  schools.  He and Karen have their own cars, and she has embarked on a small  business of her own.  He has a Keogh plan....  Henry is so carefully  guarded and his new identity is so vigorously protected by the US Marshal  Service that even the Internal Revenue had to whistle when they tried to  dun the old Henry Hill for his back taxes.  Thanks to the government for  which he works, Henry Hill has turned out to be the ultimate wiseguy.&quot;  My bottom line: see the movie AND read the book.	4.0	Next to THE GODFATHER, one of the best gangster flicks	2000-07-31	0	0	0

It's the classic tale of how Henry Hill always wanted to be a gangster. Through his trials and tribulations, he lived and died (figuratively) by his own sword. It's one of those movies that is not only a classic, but should have won the 1990 Best Picture Oscar.That being said, this review is strictly for the 2010 Blu-ray release.Although it's billed as a '20th Anniversary"", it looks nothing more than a cash grab. The BD disc is the exact same as the 2007 release. The DVD, which is a documentary on the gangster film in general, has been featured in more compilations than you can shake a stick at. At least the Digibook packaging is something new to the table, and provides some basic info on not only the production but the personnel (actors, director, etc.) as well. It's a good read if you're waiting for the disc load, which quite frankly, takes up no time at all.I truly only recommend this if you, like me, didn't own Goodfellas before. I paid my $25 entry fee for this product, and have no regrets. If you own the original Blu-ray of Goodfellas though, you can safely pass this by."	4.0	Review for 20TH ANNIVERSARY ONLY!	2013-05-30	0	0	0

While that is up for debate, there is no doubt that it's up there. Brutal, shocking and true, ""Goodfellas"" is cinema at best.Martin Scorcese directs and Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci lead the pack of an amazing bunch talented actors in this tale of notorious gangster turned rat Henry Hill (played with a quiet ferocity by Liotta). As a kid, Hill become caught up in the world of the mob. Working for reputed mob Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), he does some small jobs before moving into the big league. He meets veteran criminal Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert De Niro) and the wacko Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, who was brilliant). The three hook up for a series of violent crimes over the years. Henry also goes through a tumultous marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco). As the years go on, the stakes get higher, these Goodfellas come closer to getting caught every day. Eventually, justice reigns, and the price is paid. And if the ending is disappointing, don't forget that all of this happened.This film is truly a masterpiece. It's by far Scorcese's best film, and the actors have rarely been better. Pesci deserved his Oscar, because he stole the show from everyone.

The movie told from the character Henry played by Ray Liotta perspective, it gives you an insight of three decades of moblife.  The main plot of the movie is about an Irish-Italian boy who dreamed about being in the mafia and how he actually got a chance to do so.  The wonderful friendship between Jimmy played by Robert De Niro, Tommy played by Joe Pesci, and Henry as they grew up from petty crimes to big time heist.  As if is not interesting enough, the director grabs more of your attention when rules are broken and people start getting whack.

A representaive in the legal department informed me that,just as I had asssumed, the packaging was in fact wrong. THERE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A SPANISH SOUNDTRACK IN THE FIRST PLACE!! I asked why and the representative kindly explained that ""90% of Warner Home Video titles are for the U.S and Canadian markets, and therefore only include english and french soundtracks"" Really? You mean hispanics don't live in Canada? She was kind enough to offer me a DVD from their catalog of my choice as an apology. Now that to me is great customer service.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2UKC6QFG9L5GV	Anton Ilinski	"Many people argue about what's better - ""Goodfellas"" or ""Godfather"". I guess there's no point in discussing this question. Every movie is great. ""Goodfellas"" might not be as sophisticated as ""Godfather"" but it shows the dreadful reality of a criminal's life. The film is brutal, ruthless and clever. Director's work is brilliant, maybe one of the best by Scorcese, the cast is outstanding - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and many others (many of them you could later see in ""The Sopranos""). Part of the film's charm is that many scenes were ad-libbed by actors as said in bonus features. You'll definately want to rewind and watch them again. What's also interesting is that the movie is based on actual events and on memoirs of the real mafioso Henry Hill (who is played by Liotta here). By the way the disc has a commentary track by Hill so you can hear how it all happened in real life.One of the greatest mob movies, one of the greatest movies in general.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AR15V2ULA2EYM	Antonio Giusto	After already buying this film (a crappy DVD by the way) and a few others (All crappy transfers accept for Mean Streets.) here comes the re-releases. I will never watch another Scorcese film. My money is better spent on real Italian directors like Fedrico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, or Ermanno Olmi.Martin Scorcese joins the rank of Francis Ford Coppola. These are two directors who have based their careers in forever tarnishing the image of Italians in North Amercia.

The transfer of this film appears to be the same source as the one used for the DVD version. This is not to say that it doesn't look much better in Blu-Ray than it does on DVD. But it is not, evidently, a brand new transfer made expressly for Blu-Ray release.As happened in past generations of video standards, VHS to LaserDisc, LaserDisc to DVD, standard definition 480i to ""high def"" 1080i, and now 480p progressive scan DVD to 1080p Blu-Ray, the studios are cutting corners and, with many titles, re-issuing transfers that were ""pretty good"" for the prior standard on newer media without re-mastering them for the full potential of the newer standard. ""Pretty good"" is not why you buy a Blu-Ray, or pay a premium for it.Sadly, some major film titles are being ""shoved out there"" with on the new Blu-Ray format. This appears to be one of them. Although not nearly as bad as the abysmal ""Silence Of the Lambs"" and ""Interview With The Vampire"" BDs, the picture quality of ""GoodFellas"" is still sub-par and underwhelming compared to what it could have been with a new-transfer made with BD release in mind."	3.0	NEEDS REMASTERING.

But I have to point out that Joe Pesci stands above the rest, what he doesn't have in height he more than compensate in performance and screen presence. And then there's Ray Liotta, the first movie where I took notice of him, and Robert De Niro, who had another great film that year (Awakenings). Together with the rest of the cast, and under the meticulous direction of Martin Scorsese, this team is explosive. This is, in my opinion, the best film about organized crime.	5.0	great film	2005-08-17	3	2	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1PASRZ81DY9C	Austin Somlo	"Viewed: 11/03, 2/07, 5/10, 12/13Rate: 102/07: The introduction of Goodfellas immediately lets the audience know that they are in for a ride. I still feel this way after seventeen years when I first saw the picture in a theater. Goodfellas is a hard-hitting picture because of its momentum and taut, stylish narration. Thanks to the amazing performance of Ray Liotta, Martin Scorsese is able to craft a better gangster picture than The Godfather. More importantly, Scorsese proves that he is one of the craftiest story tellers and most stylish directors. While the nature of the content is disturbing, it's immensely provocative. Concerning to Joe Pesci's performance, I think it's vastly overrated, and there is nothing special about it; just one excellent, if awkward, scene about how ""funny"" he is. All in all, Goodfellas is a true Scorsese picture.5/10: The first two minutes of Goodfellas is what sets the tone for the rest of the film. It is a hard-hitting, brutal picture, depicting three decades of life in the mafia. Unquestionably, Goodfellas is the best gangster picture made, effectively obliterating the perch that The Godfather has stood on. What I love the most about the movie is the rawness that comes with it, and that is done most effectively by Ray Liotta. I believe that he actually makes Goodfellas the film it is. Because without him, it's a very hard for me to envision the movie retaining the same attitude and feel. The May 10, 1981 scene describes the power of his on-screen presence. All in all, Goodfellas is a must-see picture.12/13: The best part of the Goodfellas is its taut narration. The story moves fast followed by a cascade of terrific scenes. I can't think of another film this good in the same vein as Goodfellas. Ray Liotta owns everybody and is the reason why it's easy to revisit the film from time to time. Robert De Niro's minimized supporting role is also fascinating because, let's be frank, it's Robert De Niro and he makes most of his time, giving a special performance. All in all, Goodfellas has aged very well."	5.0	Ray Liotta's Performance Doesn't Get Enough Credit.	2013-12-26	1	1	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AREYMJ0BWVIAE	Bill	Though I love Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, I must say Goodfellas is my favorite Scorcese movie.  The other two movies were great dramatic pieces, but this movie is just to damn cool.  First of all the pacing is beautiful.  This thing moves like gangbusters for the whole movie.  The second is the editing.  The quick cuts add a ton to the movie.  Next is my all time favorite actor Robert De Niro.  Though in a smaller part than in other Scorcese pictures, he still puts in a good performance.  Joe Pesci is also great as Tommy DeVito rightfully won the best supporting actor award.  So overall, being the Scorcese afficiando that I am, Goodfellas stands out as the best of Scorceses career.  Raging Bull had better acting, Taxi Driver was more disturbing but the clicher has to be the &quot;how am I funny&quot; scene which is classic.So if you like the Sopranos or any other gangster movie see Goodfellas.	5.0	Scorcese's Best	2001-09-26	1	1	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	AMYDDEWDYU83E	Bill Rice	The quintessential story of all time, Scorsese delivers a film that deserved much more recognition.  The direction is superb, form the freeze frames and voice over to the classic cafe conversation betwen Henry and  Jimmy, paving the way for the De Niro Pacino showndown in Heat. Joe Pesci  won an Oscar for his role as pychotic Tommy, but the award could have  easily gone to De Niro for his bustling dealing Jimmy Conway.  As Henry  Hill, the man who trades in a life in the mob for freedom, Ray Liotta has  never been better, and the Oscar whispers around this near perfect  performance has never been equalled. The story itself is a wonderful piece,  first charming and glorifying the power of the mob before savagely showing  the downfall of Hill, particularly due to drug abuse, Scorsese has never  been bettered in the portrayal of coaine addiction than in this film.  Pilleggi's story is a masterpiece, convereted to the screen by the greatest  living filmaker and should rightly be considered as a defining moment of  our generation.	5.0	Goodfellas-four decades in the life of a gangster	1999-12-02	0	0	0

Also, given the cheesy cases, maybe Warner Brothers DVD's should be sold but not given any promotional space since after my last WB purchase I'm not likely to buy any more DVD's for a while and when I do I don't think I'll be buying any WB issues.	1.0	ONLY HALF THE MOVIE	2000-10-22	9	5	4

Why would anyone glamorize these theives and killers, hang up pictures of them?Well, the answer might be in Goodfellas. It sees low leval mob life through Henry Hill from the 1950s to 1980, back when the mafia had sizable power: unions, construction, shipping, boxing, show biz. These guys had their hands in everything,  most of all, the piggy bank. Even RFK went after them, and some think it got him killed.Hill as a teenager saw the money, the cars, the mistresses, the free passes to see Bobby Vinton. Those ""guys"" across the street at that cabstand had everything a boy with otherwise limited prospects could ever want.Hill is smart as a whip and soon gets drafted--actually, he enlists. He is the kid with more money than the grown ups. He gets to park cars, hang with the gamblers. By the early 60s, he is doing airport heists.But soon things get more violent and Hill gets hooked on cocaine. Through the 70s, it gets a lot more dangerous to be a mobster, and the violence becomes more random as the society changes. Eventually, Hill is forced out after being busted for what the mob said they were never going to do--dealing drugs.What works so well about Goodfellas is the film does not give the crime or the violence an air of tragity or judgement. Scorcessee structues the film so it is like we are hanging out with the crime crew. In bars. In Caidlacs. On jobs. Crazy Tommy shot this guy. What are we going to do with him? All this to a rock soundtrack and jump cut editing, which increases the volocity of the roller coasterBut things do unravel and the glamor unravles with it.  Goodfellas is about the price of the violence over the long haul. It sneeks up on us as much as it does Hill, and in the end, we realize what gets paid when we Scorcessee pulls the planks from under.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1ANQC6HYCKEYL	bmayne28	After the Godfather saga, I consider this to be the best mob movie in America, although, this movie is based on a true story. The movie is centered around a former mob guy turned informant, Henry Hill, who lets us spectate through his eyes as to what mob life was to him through the 50s to 80s. It shows how Hill got involved with the mob at an early age, until he became a man being involved in hits, murders, robberies, and becoming a government witness. Also, shows the benefits of being a mob guy like eating well in large prison cells, and front reserved tables at the Copacabana with no tabs.Cast and characters you have Ray Liotta who does an awesome job playing Henry Hill, as Hill also gave credit to Liotta himself in a documentary. Hill also gave, one of the world's greatest actors, Robert De Niro, a great deal of credit for his portayal of Jimmy Conway, a good mob earner. Joe Pesci's character, Tommy DeSimone, was very scary as he was a gun toting, careless lunatic. Pesci did a terrific job and was my favorite character throughout the movie cause you never knew what he was going to do next. Lorraine Bracco (Tony Soprano psychiatrist) makes her first recognizable film role as Karen Hill, Henry's wife, as she becomes an outrageable wife stressed from the dangerous life of Henry, and the things that come with it like late nights and other women.What I love most about this movie is you really get that feeling of what it was like in the fifties and seventies, and that unforgettable music that will really attract your attention. Also, you can choose an audio option where the real Henry Hill is given commentary throughout the whole movie, and tells his experience of the moment of every scene in his own words which was very entertaining.

As far as Blu Ray goes, this is much improved over my original ""flipper"" 2-sided DVD version. Some reviewers have mentioned the grain in some parts of the film. That's just the stock they made the transfer from. There is another part where there is a vertical line in the scene through De Niro that is part of the negative. But when the film is sharp, the transfer is perfect. I think this is especially obvious at the very beginning of the movie when there is tight close-up of a young Henry Hill looking out the window of his apartment and you can see the details of what looks like a green contact lens (to match Liotta I suppose).I was disappointed by the audio. It seemes a bit muddy. I need to go back to my ""flipper"" version to see if it was any better. This may be a case of trying to make Dolby 5.1 out of an old soundtrack.Overall, Certainly worth the price. Worth replacing an older version (not sure if this applies to the newer ""collecters edition"" or not.By the way, one fun part of watching this movie is picking out all the Soprano's characters that were in this film. Christoper, Pauli, ""Old"" Carmine (Tony Lipp plays ""Tony the Wop"" or something like that), I think even ""Big Pussy"", Vincent Pastore has a walk on bit. For ""The Wire"" fans, I noticed that Isiah Whitlock Jr (the ""honorable"" Sen Clay Davis) had a bit part playing a Dr when Henry is picking his wheelchair bound brother up from the hospital near the end of the film."	4.0	Good Fellas - Blu Ray	2008-02-18	1	1	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3R4TS03ITT2JC	Bob Thompson	As a person who sees a lot of movies I tend not to exagerate how much I actually like a film. I can say that of all the films I have actually sat through that &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is probably my absolute favorite. This  is a complete masterpiece, Scorsese's best film and undoubtedly a timeless  classic. Anyone who has seen &quot;GoodFellas&quot; will surely know what  I'm talking about.What makes this film so good? For me I suppose  &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is the ultimate combination of humour and violence,  having it all and losing it all, and factual information. The casting is  absolutely flawless. &quot;GoodFellas&quot; also moves with a certain  energy which is totally uncommon in films. It is so enthralling and  completely entertaining that the first time I saw it I did not want it to  stop.Although Scorsese has previously made many great masterpieces,  (Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, King of Comedy) none of them move with the same  kind of frantic pacing. &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is so aware of everything in  a criminal lifestyle that it simply continues dispensing this  surge of  information throughout its two and half hour running time. Scorsese is  fully in control and a total master of his art in this film. The camera  work is beautiful, the costumes are perfect and the soundtrack is wonderful  as well.Never before have I seen a movie that gets everything so right.  Each time I watch &quot;GoodFellas&quot; I take away something new from it.  &quot;Casino&quot;, although many felt to be a retread, is actually just as  good.Maybe because this is my favorite film does it sound like I am  over-praising it. Normally I am not this excited over a movie but if you  haven't seen &quot;GoodFellas&quot; yet you are really missing out.	5.0	The Best Movie Ever!	2000-05-19	5	4	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	AR2T3NOGFNIUH	"Bradford VS ""Bradford V."""	Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS has a lift.  It's like RAGING BULL, except that it's not domineering.  It's like RAGING BULL made in a jolly, festive frame of mind.  In essence, it's about being a guy and guys getting off on being a guy.Scorsese, who knows how to make images dance, really keeps up the heat in this film and he doesn't go for ironic detachment.  He loves the Brooklyn gang mileu, because it's where distortion, hyperbole, and exuberance all commingle.  The movie is about being the cock of the walk, with banners flying and crowds cheering.  And this is what we get and feel for the film's first 90 minutes.Is it a great film?  Yes...it's one of the best of it's genre. Period.  It's a triumphant piece of filmmaking--jounalism presented with the brio of drama.  Every frame is active and vivid, and you can feel the director's passion and delight in making these pictures move.The moviemaking has such bravura that you respond as if your were at a live performance.  It's Scorsese's performanance.  He came of age as a director in the early 70's, at a time when many film enthusiasts were caught up in the 60's idea that a great film or even a good one is always about its director.  There's a lot of  metaphoric truth to this, but Scorsese puts the idea right up front.Scorsese makes you feel you'd like to hang out with him at a bar or coffee shop and listen to him tell how he brought off the effects; he's a master.	5.0	Marty's The Master	2005-12-22	3	3	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A254RFFJDTFJKJ	"Brasington ""johnsan50"""	This movie is a true classic, but I'm not going to talk about it.  There are 413 other reviews that drool about how great Goodfellas is.  If you don't know, you are either totally inexperienced with cinema or are living under a rock.Instead, let's talk about 'features.'  The last Goodfellas DVD was a 'flipper,' or a DVD that was so cheap, you had to get up and turn it over half-way through the film.  I can accept that I need to turn Lawrence of Arabia over during the intermission, but Goodfellas is comparatively short.  It is 2.5 hours long, to  be more precise.  A 2.5 hour film fits easily onto a single-side DVD with only a mildly-noticable transfer skip.  That is the only special feature I want from this new version of the DVD.  I'll buy it, just don't make me flip it, God in heaven!Furthermore, Martin Scorsese has gotten the absolute worst treatment of any director this side of Roger Corman on DVD.  Even his last film, Gangs of NY, was subjected to a ridiculous film-ruining stop right in the middle of a love scene that is so abrupt, you have to laugh.  Didn't the jack-a$$es who ruined the Goodfellas DVD years before learn their lesson?  OK, so Gangs was done by Miramax (the worst company on Earth for DVD quality and price,) but why does this trend have to blight poor Scorsese so terribly.  He is one of the greatest living directors, for God's sake!  His movies aren't exactly low-profile.  The only Scorsese film that has been given a proper treatment is The Last Temptation of Christ, but that was a Criterion, and not a Warner DVD.That brings me to my final thought.  Considering the fact that Warner actually does a great job at releasing quality DVDs with a decent amount of interesting features most of the time, it seems doubly stupid releasing some of their greatest back-catalog titles like a lobotomized afterthought.DIE!	5.0	I hope that it's not a &quot;flipper&quot; AHHHHHHH!	2004-07-15	1	1	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A3AW47HEFYPEVW	Brendan	THE MOVIE ITSELFThis movie is not only the best of the genre, but one of the best films ever made.Italian Americans may get angry with the stereotypes brought about by the making of these films as the most recognizable aspects of thier culture but such as life.This film chronicles the life Henry Hill, based on the book &quot;WiseGuy&quot;. His rise from neighborhood kid learning to score, to a full fledged, yet not connected mafia affilliate.Scorsese is at the top of his game here. The use of popular music from every era that this film chronicles in each part is a high point. Also, the full frontal graphic parts make this one of the greatest experiences ever. These range from the fights between Henry and his wife, to Tommy getting shot in the back of the head. The Billy Batts beatdown. ...This movie has a pulse and creates a timeless time on screen all its own. I don't know why this film did not make best picture.The acting is all on point with every character. The most realistic/convincing piece of acting I have ever seen is the scene where Liotta(hill), pistol whips the neighbor/date/preppie of his future wife. When he is walking away from the guy he has just pistol whipped, the rage in Liotta's eyes is beyond real. It is the single most convincing, space subtraction between the human eye and the screen I have ever experienced.This is a classic and it is only a decade old. People still hail &quot;Little Caeser&quot; and &quot;Public Enemy.&quot; Goodfellas will no doubt go down in the same category.DVD ASPECTSThe DVD is great, but the seasoned DVD enthusiast will be a bit put off by the fact that the disc is dual sided and not dual layered. The audio should also be redone to suit the new audio formats. This is a classic film that should be presented in the latest technological advances.	5.0	The best Mob film ever made.	2001-03-23	1	1	0

I didn't care if anyone got killed.  I was so bored i almost cried. ...  I hate having to watch a whole movie from the worst character's point of view.  The main character of this started doing drugs near the end.  His mind got all messed up.  If you like maffia movies, see Casino.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A14BICEIB1EUI4	Brennan Tyler	Goodfellas would have to be one of the most brilliantly pure interpretations of gangsters in the United States that I have ever seen.Starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesciand Lorraine Bracco, 'Goodfellas' was written by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorcese, although much of the script is based on a true to life novel by Pileggi, spanning 30 years of lif in the mafia in the United States.De Niro's performance of the criminalistic Jimmy Conway gives the film a naturalistic power, purely describing many of the capabilities and needs of a gangster. But not only is this film ingeniously acted, director Scorcese uses many daring film techniques, such as lengthy scenes without using any cuts (check the scene where they enter the niteclub).There are brilliant performances by all; in particularly the often exuberant Joe Pesci, for which this picture garnered him his first oscar. Liotta is versatile in his role of Henry Hill, and Lorraine Bracco plays a gangster's wife with pure perfection. All things aside, Goodfellas is a fantastic movie and is one to stand the test of time for many years to come. This film is worth watching many times. I give it 5 stars.	5.0	&quot;Goodfellas&quot;, a brilliant motion picture	2002-08-26	13	8	5

0790729725	GoodFellas	A20IVL127LEW6S	Brian Brems	In this film, Robert DeNiro, the greatest actor of all time, is teamed with Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci, whom he worked with in Raging Bull.  The  movie is told as a narrative from Liotta's character's, Henry Hill, point  of view.  It chronicles three decades of his life in the mob, from his days  working at a mob owned cab stand in the fifties to his mob breakdown in the  seventies.  The musical selection is excellent, as is the camerawork.  The  use of zooms and slow motion makes some of the best camera shots ever.  As  for the music, it changes with the time frame as the movie goes on.  There  is an interesting incorporation of the song &quot;Layla&quot; by Derek and  the Dominos.  The movie is based on a true story from a book written by  co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, who would also go on to write  &quot;Casino&quot;, also for Martin Scorsese.  The directing is awesome,  and the acting is phenomenal. Joe Pesci in an Oscar-winning performance for  Best Supporting Actor, is the testy Tommy Davito.  Also Oscar nominated, is  Lorraine Bracco, now of the Sopranos, as Liotta's wife.  Paul Sorvino also  is very critical to the film's success.

With all due respects to Mr. Coppola, &quot;Goodfelleas&quot; blows away even &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up in  the same neighborhoods as the characters in his film, captures onscreen the  most creditble crime story ever told.  Unfolding over the course of three  decades, the movie tells the story of Henry Hill, a mid-level mobster who  only turned state's evidence against his fellows after he had no other  choice.  The movie is bursting with memorable characters; Joe Pesci as the  hotheaded mobster, Robert DiNiro as the cold blooded killer-thief, Paul  Sorvino as the head of the family.  If these guys don't put a chill through  you, nothing will.  This is the best movie from one of America's greatest  directors.	5.0	Fugettaboutit -- the best crime movie ever made	2000-06-13	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A14LIZKKA7WYT9	brigsbmc@cs.com	"Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is one to be cherished,  valued,  and especially enjoyed over and over again.  Originally entitled WiseGuys from writer and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi's novel,  this title was dropped because of the existence of a Brian De Palma comedy already called WiseGuys starring Joe Piscopo and Danny Devito.  That WiseGuys has NOTHING on GOODFELLAS!  Goodfellas is more than a movie.  It is an experience!  What made this movie so different from other mob movies was the fact that the mob was treated as a seperate race from society.  From the explosive beginning to the near-heartbreaking conclusion,  the mob has you in the palm of their hands.  (...) The movie is told through the eyes of Henry Hill,  who grows up under the wing of the mob after taking a part time job there at the cab stand,  the hangout for the hitmen,  bosses, paesaens,  and Italianos.  The plot is so intricate and vast,  that it would be impossible to go through it in its entirety.  To break down,  Hill(Ray Liotta) grows up a friend ally to Mob legend Jimmy Conway(Robert DeNiro) and psychotic killer Tommy(Joe Pesci) while always under the supervision of Paulie(Paul Sorvino).  Hill marries Karen(Lorraine Bracco) and through three decades of drugs,  money,  murder,  and sex,  the men and women lose and win,  are killers or killed,  thiefs or victims,  you name it,  Goodfellas has got it.  All of this is amazingly pulled together by one of the finest filmmakers of our time,  Martin Scorsese(co-writer/Director).  Above all other scenes and situations beautifully filmed,  none can compare to Scorsese's ""coup de cinema"" tracking shot.  Those of you who have seen the movie more than once will likely know what I'm talking about.  With ""And then he kissed me"" blaring, Karen and Henry enter the Copacabana from the side entrance and proceed into the night club  in an incredibly filmed camera tracking sequence which never once takes its eyes off Henry and Karen until they are comfortably sat in the front of the Copa's band.  It is a testament to the fact that Scorsese's genius and talent is beyond compare.  Speaking of music,  nearly everyone knows that it is difficult to imagine anyone besides Scorsese who can use music so ingeniously in film.  The opening Tony Bennett number ""Rags to Riches"" sets the tone immediately for the amazing film which has already begun,  and the soundtrack is a must-have.  Personal favorite:  the rock n' roll blasting as the camera closes in on Robert DeNiro smoking his cigarette only the way DeNiro can.  The cast is amazing,  with Robert DeNiro giving a great performance.  Ray Liotta is electrifying as Henry Hill.  Personally,  I was very dismayed when Liotta did not receive an Oscar nomination for that performance,  he basically carried a good deal of that film with excellent versatility.  Oscar winner Joe Pesci walked home with the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his Tommy,  and Lorraine Bracco's strong-willed Karen was honored by a nomination and a great performance.  Paul Sorvino is cool and awesome as Paulie the boss,  and even Scorsese's parents get into the act,  his father playing the hitman who actually is responsible for Timmy's undoing,  and Catherine Scorsese plays Tommy's religious mother.  The scene in which Henry,  Tommy, and Jimmy end up at her house looking for a shovel to bury the man they nearly beat do death in the trunk,  she comes down and fixes each man a meal in one of the funniest scenes in the film.  Yes,  funny,  what makes this film so great is that there is a great deal of humor and it eases the tension of the viewer with a weak stomach.  Goodfellas was nominated for six Oscars,  including Best Picture and Best Director,  and was named Best Picture by the NY and LA Film Critics Association and the National Film Board Review.  It is absolutely one of the best films ever made,  and it stands mighty as number 95 on AFI's 100 best films of all time,  being placed among Platoon,  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,  Casablanca,  The Godfather,  Citizen Kane,  and Gone With  The Wind.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Joe Pesci won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his part in GoodFellas, a film nominated for six Academy Awards overall including Best Picture. And every accolade attributed to this film is well deserved. With an all-star cast of performers, GoodFellas is one of director Martin Scorsese's greatest productions. Based on the true story of former mobster Henry Hill, GoodFellas begins with his famous quote, ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster...""GoodFellas follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian American who becomes involved in organized crime at a young age. Quickly rising in stature as a small time gangster, Henry wins the heart of a local Jewish girl, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), despite her parents' objections. Karen, though frightened, is fascinated by Henry's life of crime. He has many friends - rich friends, powerful friends. And nobody messes with him. When they get married, Karen is forced to adjust to the life of a typical mobster's wife...Meanwhile, Henry's best friends (he and Karen only associate with those connected to the mob) in crime are Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) - two fellow wiseguys with their sights set on bigger and better jobs. When Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy pull together a team that executes the biggest heist in years, their reputations rise fast within the mob hierarchy. But things begin to fall apart when the incompetent and undisciplined men with whom they worked start flaunting cash from the robbery. The three friends are forced to kill off several members of the team in order to avoid raising the suspicions of the police.But eventually, Henry becomes arrogant and reckless, landing himself in jail. When he gets out, he's careful in his business dealings due to the fact that local mob boss Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) has his eye on him. Paulie doesn't want Henry to do anything stupid and land himself in jail again. But in the end, Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy get more than they bargained for when Tommy kills an annoying barfly - unaware that the man he killed was a ""made man"". Now, each man must figure out for himself which direction his life will take...Raw and blunt in its pronouncements, GoodFellas easily holds its own with some of the greatest films of all time. Like any good story, it brings the audience into an unknown world of mystery and seduction. The audience begins to feel the tension along with the characters in the film. That's the mark of a great movie...Liotta, Pesci, and De Niro all stand out in this epic drama about one man's life as a professional criminal. Through each man, the audience views the perks and the pitfalls of life in the mob as well as the perpetual feeling that one is always looking over his shoulder. GoodFellas doesn't glamorize life in the mob by any means, and those who enjoyed The Godfather will appreciate its contemporary slant on the drug trade to which Don Corleone so vigorously objected. When taking an objective view, GoodFellas stacks up as one of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and it certainly merits the designation of must-see film...The DVD Report"	5.0	One of the Top 100 films of all time...	2005-04-20	1	0	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1RFFLNUCSBW2S	"B. Slooten ""bvanslooten2"""	What in the world were Warner Brothers thinking?  First they botched the Stanley Kubrick DVD Collection years ago when they released the worst looking video copies ever on DVD.  The VHS versions looked 10X better.3 years ago they released the first Goodfellas DVD that had the outdated technology of a single layered disc that you had to flip over when the film was half way over.  The visual quality and treatment was average, but nothing great, for a very visually oriented film.Now, 3 years later and something I've been looking forward to for a long time they release a 2 disc special features DVD for a very well made film.I'm appalled and saddened to say that this version is the worst treatment to DVD I've ever seen.  You will see bleached out and washed out images that look ghostly.  You will see scratches on the film image (ie, the scene where DeNiro and Sorvino go over to Liotta's girlfriend penthouse to warn him about messing around with his wife) You will see colors that fade and flickers or light that have no purpose of being there.  You will see horizontal lines from time to time that appear out of nowhere.You will see something that is horrifying to watch and something you can't miss becuase it's so distracting. On the interior shots in the bars or the darkly lit room scenes and there are square pixels all over the place.  This really will distract you.I own a $3,500 Mitsuomi DVD player that is state of the art. It's a prototype from Japan and it's the best in the world. This player will fix flaws and try to correct them when playing back DVDs.  I also own a Sony Progressive scan DVD player that is top of the line for consumer models.  I played this DVD on both models and same result.  Absolute trash.The first edition flip side DVD has much, much better quality and that DVD wasn't anything to laud over.My advice to all of you is if your a big fan of the movie, buy it.  You'll like some of the special features (although they are very very short) but don't get it if you think your getting an upgrade in quality...you're not, you're actually downgrading.  I'm deeply disappointed and very disturbed by this trashy release of a very good film.Shame on you Warner Brothers.

But here in the rerelease we get yet the same version of the flick as before with a better picture and not the different soundtrack. Sounds alot like Scarface to me.The audio com's as cool as they are, are not that worthy of repeat listening.SO what else does this ""new"" double DVD have? Deleated scenes? No. Uncut version of the film? No. Retarded extras that you would only view once with nothing added to the film?

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""The Godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""Goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series ""The Sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made. ""Goodfellas"" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss ""Big Paulie"" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, ""made man"" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kid's birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative."	5.0	Greatest mobster movie ever made	2006-01-21	4	4	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2IRT10663Y6NF	Cari	"I purchased a Two-Disc Special Edition of ""GoodFellas"".  When it arrived, it was a single disc (contrary to the picture and description).  The ""Special Features"" were those of olden-time DVDs where a book worth of dialogue pops up.  What is most disturbing is that the jewel case cover for this DVD is correct adornments on the cover claiming to be the ""Two-Disc Special Edition"" and descriptions of the special features on the back.  There was only one disc included and none of the special features described were present.  0 for 2 isn't a great score in my book.When I presented this information to the seller, he claimed that this was the correct edition as with ""Warner it is normal for their two disk released with disk one as side A and Disk two as side B.""  I am old enough to remember the early days of DVDs so this seemed fair to say, but what he said next was ""It is the only way the two disk version exists of this title.""  This is clearly untrue.  My brother owns the same edition which has two discs and even the picture that the seller shows as the item description picture shows a version with two discs.He then tried to get me to send it back to him ""at [my] own expense"" and he would issue a refund when it arrived.  Not wanting to spend money on TESG's mistake, I e-mailed him back telling him again, that I received the wrong edition of the film and I expected to be compensated without needing to spend my own money in the process.  His reply is as follows...""I am confused with the fact that you ordered an item, got exactly what you ordered, refuse to return the item for a refund, and file a claim to keep the item wanting both the item and a refund.  Again, I shall issue a refund once the item is returned and until the item is returned I can not take any action on this matter.""You will notice that he still claims I got what I ordered.  He claims that I wanted the DVD, which is untrue.  And his ""confusion"" is clearly a veiled method for implying that my claim was fraudulent.By this time, Amazon had already stepped in and refunded my money so thank God for that.  This company was giving me a headache.  All negative reviews of this seller say basically the same thing and if we are saying these things independently then there is little doubt to their validity.If you buy from this seller, I guess you'd better hope really hard that you get what you purchased because any dissatisfaction with your purchase will be met with rude and accusatory dissent."	1.0	Wrong Product+Rude Service	2012-07-24	4	2	2

Superbly directed by Martin Scorsese, staring Ray Liotta as Henry Hill; Robert DeNiro as Jimmy Conway; and Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito.  I think the Academy Awards Society is still regretful that they voted ""Ordinary People"" as the Best Picture of 1990 instead of GoodFellas.  Joe Pesci got the Award as Best Supporting Actor.  Dialogue from the film is classic and quoted many times.  Period music throughout the movie works splendidly.I love this movie so much that I sent a copy to my nephew.  The disk was blank.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1ASCECH3KOZ3P	C. Gardner	"""Goodfellas"" was a fantastic start for the cinema of the 1990s, and has not dated itself in any way. It's a quasi-documentary about the social life of a Brooklyn branch of the mafia, and is packed with facts and observations which are seamlessly intertwined with the narrative (and in a non-gratuitous manner, too, unlike ""Gangs of New York,"" where the historical information seemed shoehorned in lieu of the story). The voice-over narration which Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese hammered out of Henry Hill's memoir is humorous and observant, and Ray Liotta's reading of it utterly natural-sounding. To me, watching actors entirely inhabit their roles makes the most spectacular CGI-saturated movies pale in comparison, and with a script as good as this one, it becomes a magic experience. Especially impressive is Paul Sorvino's Paulie Cicero, whose subtle expressions and mannerisms are amusing as hell all throughout the film. All the major cast are fantastic, but even those in the secondary roles are vivid, like Frank Vincent as a paroled mobster who gets done in by a senseless and spectacular act of petty revenge, or Chuck Low as Morrie the Wigmaker, whose constant nagging of master criminal Jimmy Conway (de Niro) for his cut of a big score grinds the latter down (not a person you want to bug even once). ""Goodfellas"" contains scene after scene of brilliant acting, perfect period music choices, a narrative which is both illuminating and suspenseful (even though the film has a very loose, episodic feel)."	5.0	The Ironic Tale of a Wiseguy	2004-03-28	1	1	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A285HKOX8YG18Y	C.

Unlike most films, these events are not filtered or linked to the virtues and vices of its characters in a way that creates a thematically cohesive narrative. To some, this may enhance its appeal by increasing its apparent verisimilitude.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3W44NDEQ2YD0S	Chris	"As an Italian-American, let me tell you why folks like Scorsese and Coppola make mob movies. It's because those of you who are not eat this garbage up like a big dish of baked ziti! It makes them rich, so why not! Sure it happened, but the mob life represents a razor thin sliver of the whole Italian experience in America. In my opinion Goodfellas is somewhat overated.  I found this film somewhat boring and depressing at the same time, like ""Boogie Nights or Casino.""  I didnt feel there was enough tension because you dont care who got whacked next. Who do you root for? Ray Liotta's character ""Henry Hill"" is as close to being the one protagonist in the movie but he has too many bad traits -infedelity, drug abuse, murder ect. that you are not endeared to him. And his wife becomes transformed into the very type of mob wife she originally despised.  Pesci's charachter Tommy is compleatly despicible and deserved what he had comming to him. I did think the scene where he goes on about ""do you find me amusing?!!"" pretty funny though. I didnt think the film very entertaining untill Liotta's charachter was franticly trying to evade the narc helicopter that was trailing him. If you like mob movies and are looking for escape from a mundane life, you would probably like this one, so eat up-Mangia!"	3.0	Another Unflattering Picture	2003-09-28	13	9	4

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2MIOCFZ3PAXIO	Christophe E. Johnson	This film has been hailed as a masterpiece in the Mafia Genre of movies.  Although few films have a greater cast as a powerhouse such as De Niro, Pesci, and Liotta, the history of the premise behind the film's story is shoddy.  If you have extensive knowledge of the Mafia's history, than you would also know that Henry Hill and his cohorts weren't even Mafia members.  Nonfiction accounts of these characters portray them as small timers and sometimes even laughable at best.  For what this movie is, it's great entertainment.  But if you are an aficionado of Cosa Nostra, it's not much of a story.	4.0	Big Actors; Small Time Mobsters	2005-11-28	1	0	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A38C12950IM24P	Christopher J. Cowen	Goodfellas is such a good movie that I wish I could rate it than 5 stars.  Since Amazon only goes up to 5 stars I'll have to settle for only 5 stars. This movies is a classic and is not only a great crime thiller but also a great movie under any genre.  Goodfellas features the amazing acting of Robert Deniro.Goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film follows the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family through the eyes of a Lucchese associate, Henry Hill. The movie covers the period of time from 1955 to 1980. The movie features the great acting of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino. Goodfellas was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor (Joe Pesci, who won).I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review.	5.0	GoodFellas is a classic	2013-12-06	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	ASU5IH3CM6XXE	ChrisTyrrell	"This movie fails where others succeed.  I know that lots of people think that this is one of Martin Scorcese's best films of all time, but they are just dead wrong.  It is about three friends who work in the mob and eventually they all do horrible, horrible things to one another.To begin with, this movie is obviously a work of fiction because who would believe that someone like Robert DeNiro could be a gangster?  If you've ever seen him in Stanley & Iris, you know that he is much more believable as a good man who just wants to read with Jane Fonda.  Also, Joe Pesci is really great as the short mafiaman in this movie.This kind of movie is definitely not Martin Scorcese's forte, and even if someone like George Lucas (awesome director) were to do it, it wouldn't be much better because the story doesn't make sense.  Why do these three friends decide to do mob violence all the time?  Do you think they would really talk with such foul mouths too (""f"" this and ""f"" that)???  I love My Cousin Vinny, and I don't believe Joe Pesci had to say any bad words to make that movie hilarious.Basically this movie is like a reality TV show that you would turn off quickly because there's nothing interesting about it.  And the three friends in the movie also do drugs, which I am against.I think this film would be good for carpenters and other tradesmen, because they probably like this kind of thing.  For the rest of us, it's for the birds!!!!  If you see it, you will blame yourself forever, and that's not being fair to the you inside.Maybe next time, Martin Scorcese.

Thanks to those who do this.They didn't put a whole lot of money or effort into this Blu-Ray release of ""Goodfellas"".  First off, the video aspect ratio was 1.85:1, instead of being 2.35:1, but I don't know if that is a limitation of the film.  Second, there was no DTS-HD Master Audio or Dobly TrueHD; just Dolby Digital 5.1.The video quality was not real great.  I didn't notice any grain at all, but the picture just wasn't that impressive.  But, it was still okay to watch (it wasn't bad enough to be distracting). I give it about an 8.0 to 8.5 on a 10.0 scale.The audio was very good, but there wasn't much sound from the surround speakers.  But, there was good left / right separation.This is a pretty good movie, which lasted about 2 hours and 21 minutes."	4.0	Video Quality Not Great for a Blu-Ray, But Still Okay	2012-02-25	4	4	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AJBHPCBU2C5CM	C. Kim	GoodFellas is one of my 6 favorite movies. Whats not to like? There's violence, heist, lil bit of humor, and raw emotion. The thing that sets this mob movie apart from the rest is the fact that it's realistic. Movies like Scarface and The Godfather are romanticized or they seem like fantasies. Everybody in this film did a phenomenal job. Also, I'd like to mention that Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro are my favorite.I would also like to add that the DVD extras were pretty cool.	5.0	F-ing A, Nuff said	2007-04-12	1	1	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	AZ5250G2U795I	C. K. Ogi	Goodfellas is one of the best movies of all time.  This really isn't ever the question.  Scorsese packs a whollop in this film that just can't be described adequately.  Peschi's performance, while often lampooned, is still searing in it's psychotic roller-coaster ride.  Liotta gives the most remarkable performance ever caught on film of the throes of drug-induced paranoia.  Bracco, too, turns in a performance that is typical of her calibur and skillfully multi-faceted.  The performances make this movie worth multiple watchings.The DVD, however...is NOT worth your time.  Originally released in 1997, the lack of extras, while annoying, can almost be overlooked.  However, it's double sided, which means half-way through the film you have to stop and turn it over.  It completely wrecks the flow of the film, not to mention is just annoying.While you can't go wrong buying this DVD for the film, when it gets rereleased in an enhanced version (I'm sure it will although I have no firsthand knowledge of this.  They can't leave a movie like this in the dust in the world of DVD, and it's DVD quality is just not there), that will be a definite must-have.	5.0	5 stars are for the film...but DVD deserves to lose a star.	2003-02-21	0	0	0

The scenes in this movie are very vivid; they stick with you.  It's hard to forget the climactic scenes that show the day Henry Hill is caught selling drugs, for instance.This movie has been accused by some of glorifying the Mafia life. I think the opposite is the case. Although in the beginning of the movie clearly it looks good to be a gangster, that all changes when Hill is caught with drugs and has his life threatened by his best friends.I'm having trouble getting across how wonderful I think this movie is.  Let me sum up by saying that if you are interested in the Mafia at all, especially in seeing how a blue collar Mob guy lived, you should check out GoodFellas.	5.0	My personal all-time favorite	2003-06-14	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"It was odd but I remember that my dad had a massive VHS collection and starting to become a film freak, I decided to watch a whole lot from Godfather 1-3 to Schindler's List to this one. It's funny how little I actually remembered of them. Yeah I remember the ""how am I funny?"" scene, the news on the payphone and one character's faux-made scene but I kind of forgot about it. Recently I decided to check it out and again and it was as great as I knew it was the first time, what little I remembered of it anyway. While I still see Raging Bull as a Scorsese masterpiece, this one is too.The film, based on a true story, follows Henry Hill who gets involved with the mafia. Loving the idea at an early age he becomes a junior member, and helping out. As he gets older, he's dealing with everything that comes with it, including what happens when you kill a made man without a hit being called, as well as federal officers and a growing drug habit.Some people might regard this as Godfather lite, a kind of ripoff passed off as something on its own. The only thing it's got in common is the whole mafia angle, that and Robert De Niro, who was in Part II. Godfather is about showing the inner workings of the top brass of the ""families"", this film's more about the soldiers, the so-called muscle who do all the jobs and handle the business personally. Sometimes they have to get quite violent including one unlucky guy who gets stabbed AND shot. The film's not as outright violent as I've seen but they're are some pretty un-kid friendly stuff here.Performance-wise it's solid across the board. In an odd segue, George Lucas said he didn't want to work with Harrison Ford for Indiana Jones because of American Graffiti and the Star Wars trilogy, saying ""I don't want my own Bobby De Niro"". Well Scorsese is a huge fan of Robert De Niro, off the top of my head I count Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, the King of Comedy, Mean Streets, New York New York and Cape Fear. Wow, lot of movies, good luck charm or just easy casting? Not to fear, he's reliable and he's great here too.Another Scorsese repeat(although not as often), Joe Pesci returns in another performance of a manic character but that's alright. Although I don't like the laugh, Ray Liotta does a good job as Henry Hill but my personal favorite is Lorraine Bracco playing his wife, Karen. Perfect at first but then goes more and more crazy until her craziness matches Henry's. Everybody else is great too, including a too-quick cameo by Samuel L. Jackson.It's of course quite a great film and a film classic in its own right which should be enough to warrant a purchase, but however, try your local video store for a try, you never know, you might hate it. I didn't though."	5.0	As good as everyone says it is	2006-04-25	4	3	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A3QB2VPGHT0SVC	"C. Monk ""CM"""	"This is a film that Scorsese should have won the Oscar for, not ""The Departed.""Goodfellas follows the life of Henry Hill through his life with the Mafia.  The story is based on the real-life Henry Hill.This film really established Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta as solid actors.  With Robert De Niro and Lorraine Bracco, the cast was just perfect.  The acting was great all around and the plot was very entertaining.Unlike what is seen in ""The Godfather,"" Goodfellas probably more accurately portrays what real life is like in the Mafia, atleast from what I've read.  Not that ""The Godfather"" isn't any good, it's great but it almost glorifies that lifestyle to an extent.Anyway,  as I said, the plot is entertaining and this is a film you could watch more than once.  The characters are interesting and the humor is appropriate.  There is some graphic violence as to be expected but it is not over the top.  There's plenty of foul language but again, it's not over the top.Overall, this is a film that you must see, if for nothing else to see Joe Pesci's famous ""am I a clown"" scene."	5.0	Classic Mob Movie	2008-03-04	0	0	0

The mob stands as sign and symbol for American capitalist corporate life.Under the guise of a nostalgic loving examination of New York's organized crime scene, the director of the Last Temptation of Christ rips open for our examination the inferno which our civilization became and the immoral base upon which it thrived. It is difficult to see any hope for such an empire based upon betrayal, drugs, violence and greed. Scorcese presents the pits of sin as clearly as Dante's Inferno, and runs them through to there logical conclusions in death and destruction.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"GoodFellas is a criminal epic that spans three decades while following the dramatic rise and fall of three gangsters through the eyes of one them-Henry Hill (Liotta). Early on, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) tells Henry the two most important rules for a gangster to follow: ""Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut."" Of course, Henry will break both these rules by the end of the movie. The film depicts their obsessive pursuit of the American Dream, how consuming it is, and how everything eventually turns sours and ultimately devours them. The movie is also about addiction and how it not only draws the characters in but us as well. We become addicted to the power of the film's style and visuals, which shows the seductive allure of the gangster lifestyle: to be able to do anything. And yet, the film isn't afraid to show the flipside-the nightmarish lows that come with the dizzying highs.The first DVD features two audio commentaries with the first being a cast and crew track. Comments from Martin Scorsese, actors Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and Frank Vincent, co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, producers Irwin Winkler and Barbara De Fina, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker are edited together for select scenes thereby eliminating any dead air. Scorsese expertly analyzes several scenes (he could have easily done his own track) as he and Pileggi dominate the commentary.The second track, entitled ""The Cop and Crook Commentary,"" features the real Henry Hill and former FBI agent Edward McDonald who sponsored Henry for the witness protection program. This is a factual based track that makes one appreciate the authenticity of Scorsese's film.The second DVD starts things off with ""Getting Made,"" an excellent 30-minute retrospective featurette that mixes brand new interviews with Liotta, Sorvino and Bracco with older ones from Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci. The featurette acts as a nice companion piece to the commentaries.""The Workaday Gangster"" features the real Henry Hill and examines how authentic the film depicted his life and the lure of the gangster lifestyle. This comes off as redundant after listening to Hill's commentary.One of the more entertaining featurettes is ""The GoodFellas Legacy"" which has several famous filmmakers gush about why they love the movie so much and what, in their opinion, makes it a great film.""Paper is Cheaper Than Film"" is a brief look at the annotations Scorsese made to the screenplay that he and Pileggi wrote together.Rounding things out is a theatrical trailer.GoodFellas proved to be a favourite with critics and audiences alike. It became one of Scorsese's most successful and famous films since Taxi Driver. GoodFellas has stood the test of time and its legacy paved the way for The Sopranos with half of its cast alumni from Scorsese's movie. Warner Brothers has finally done this classic movie justice with an excellent two-DVD set."	5.0	"""Now go get yer shine box!"""	2004-08-19	4	2	2

Even though the info on the back of the box says that it's from 2007 and is formatted for widescreen TVs, it's still two-sided (you have to flip it over halfway for the other half of the movie) and it's literally NOT made for widescreen televisions.  Of course since it was opened I couldn't return it unless I exchanged it for the exact same thing, which also happens to Warner Home Video's policy according to their website.  No thanks, I'm good.If you want it to actually look NORMAL on your widescreen TV, you have to spend twice as much and get the special edition...great job there Warner...	1.0	Don't get this copy, it's a ripoff	2010-03-14	3	3	0

The first (and only) time I tried to watch it the movie randomly stopped in the middle. I looked at the menu and it only went to scene 19 (right after Joe Pesci kills spider at poker). I tried it on another dvd player and it did the same thing.  I called the amazing amazon customer service and they credited the money back to me. The representative was super friendly!

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3UQLOZKAGTHY9	daniel mcinnis	A contemporary classic stylishly directed by Martin Scorsese, it's among his finest two plus hours (and that's really saying something coming from the man who brought us Taxi Driver &amp; Raging Bull!).  He once again  teams with Robert DeNiro to bring this seering tale of New York City's  organized crime syndicate in the late 70's to life.  The supporting cast  includes Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and Joe Pesci (in the scene-stealing  performance that won him the Oscar). Based on the novel Wiseguy by Nicolas  Pillegi (who co-wrote the script) Goodfellas follows the life of Henry  Hill, a connected guy who lives out his criminal fantasy of being a member  of the mob and eventually decends into drugs, which leads to his ultimate  demise.  The use of the oldies pop/rock soundtrack has often been immitated  but never duplicated (though Pulp Fiction would be a comperable  comparison).  Beware: fans of The Godfather may be distraught in seeing  their ideallic vision of mob life torn down brick by brick.  Let there be  no mistake, this mob movie stands unrivaled (though it's getting a push  from the HBO series The Sopranos).  I  urge fans of this movie to check out  The King of Comedy (another DeNiro/Scorsese masterpiece).	5.0	Great  Fellas	2000-03-12	27	23	4

I've seen quite a bit of movies as well!First of all, I love Henry's character. Great story. Hardworking kid works his way up and eventually lands with the top dogs Pauly, Jimmy, & Tommy.As the viewer, we're taken into quite an intense, sometimes laughable, & surreal ride. I loved it when Henry and Jimmy simply rob a truck driver at gun point. The robbery seemed oh too easy. Who knew this type of stuff happens?I love this movie because it's so beautifully shot and told. I love this movie because of the unique and believable characters. I love this movie because it teaches us something in life:  Ya can't always do things the cleanest of ways...	5.0	Sometimes, you just gotta be a little Crooked.	2008-07-09	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A11EK3U1DXWBSX	da_nolo	"Good Fellas is a movie with everything working for it. Taking in consideration for the director, actors, movie crew, script, editing, and what ever else you can look at in order to develop and over all critic a movie; there is no wonder to why this movie is a favorite among millions.The five stars rating is a personal opinion based not just on different aspects required to put a movie together (crew, editing, etc.), but style and other personal likes.Firstly, the movie is based on actual events. Some may waive this in saying it is not important as it does not mean whether or not everything happened as in the movie. Perfect example would be ""the social network"". A movie based on a single event in someone's life, yet depicting that moment in the classic Hollywood fashion in over exaggerating as well as substituting actuality with fiction. However, in comparison ""GoodFellas"" (if one was interested in historical facts) is not just one step, but several steps closer to the actual ""Henry Hill"" (names are swapped for fictional names).Beyond the above social interest in why a person may join the mob (and like this movie), there is still a fantastic romantic view provided along with it's harsh reality. A difficult task made to look easy. With it; a person easily slips into the story as if he/she was actually there. Only made possible by the production crew and everyone else who worked on the film.""Good Fellas"" was written, directed, and edited wonderfully which could be used for up coming movie enthusiasts, or to just sit back and relax for pure entertainment value. Having owned a copy for a few years, I have watched it close to 25 times if not more. Clearly it is a favorite.Which is why I added a fifth star. Normally I am comfortable in saying that a movie is four stars as most are. Not everything goes perfect in creating a movie, and even after post production there could still be little pieces or trivial aspects that do not work or seem to be off. ""Good Fellas"" is no way different, but remains easier to view. Adding to reasons why it is so easy to watch again and again."	5.0	GoodFellas = GoodMovie	2010-10-04	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Martin Scorcese's epic tale of the rise and fall of small-time Mafioso Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his associates is riveting storytelling that is often as densely packed with information about the details and culture of mob life as a documentary.  As a boy, Hill aspires to the power and wealth of the wiseguys he sees around the neighborhood.  As he rises through the ranks, accumulating money, power, and a beautiful wife (Lorraine Bracco), Scorcese shows us how seductive this lifestyle can be.  Yet he never flinches from its basic brutality and the thuggish mindset that money cannot change.  In the end, the concept of honor among theives is shown to be a lie, a self-aggrandizing fiction that lasts only as long as it coincides with self-interest.  This is perhaps Scorcese's best film and benefits enormously from complex, important supporting performances from long-time Scorcese accomplices Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.	5.0	Perhaps Scorcese's best film	2007-05-20	1	0	1

The direction is superb--the long tracking shot, following Henry Hill from his car, threw the kitchen, and to his table at a nightclub, is amazing.But I wish Scorsese had found a way to pick up the pace o the last 30 minutes.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A9K0YU07JICHI	David Olson	Martin Scorsese is arguably the greatest American film director of the last twenty years. I have a hard time picking his best film: is it his depiction of the disturbed Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Jack La Matta's  rise to triumph and his fall from fame in Raging Bull or his picture of the  Mafia between 1955 and 1985. This film is riveting. The actors all work  great together (although I would have liked to have seen Robert Deniro a  bit more!). As Roger Ebert said the film sweeps you through the film to the  end where evrything just crashes and falls down. And, as Scorsese  confirmed, the music is used very well to reflect the changing time  periods. Roger Ebert was right to pick this film as one of the best of the  decade.	5.0	An Amazing Film Experience	2000-04-22	0	0	0

How does one even begin to praise this masterpiece that simply has no weaknesses?  The casting and script writing of &quot;Good Fellas&quot; are near perfect, and the story based on the true life experiences of Henry Hill provides us with a brutal and unsentimental view of a social milieu that is both treacherous and violent.  These are not men of honor, but ruthless back stabbers who don't hesitate to betray close friends for a few pieces of silver.  Ray Liotta splendidly portrays Hill as a man who joins the mob as a teenager for the excitement and fast money.  Those like Jimmy Conway (Robert Di Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) befriend Hill in their own dubious manner.  Hill looks upon them as brothers, but it seems they merely perceive him as a fellow party animal who aptly carries out his responsibilities to the group.  Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill is a woman who marries her man knowing full well about his dangerous side.  Hill introduces his wife to drugs and often places her in harm's way.  Their marriage is a never ending dysfunctional disaster.  It totally redefines the meaning of family values.This is not a film for someone seeking a romanticized depiction of organized crime. These people are monsters who prey on their fellow citizens.  Scorsese refuses to pretend that they have many redeeming qualities.  Their virtues are few and far between,  and one only regrets that it takes so long for the authorities to put them behind bars.  Hill's later entry into a federal witness protection program is hard to swallow.  &quot;Good Fellas&quot; is hard hitting and honest.  I easily place it among the top one hundred movies of all time.	5.0	&quot;Good Fellas&quot; is a Magnificent Artistic Achievement	2001-12-02	4	2	2

0790729725	GoodFellas	A35RLO0D7DWL50	"""demonofthefall55"""	"I'll just point out right now that I'm going to spend more time reviewing the movie rather than the DVD features. As a DVD, this is really nothing special (it has no commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, or any of the other extras that have come to define what DVD is about), but it's worth owning just for the movie. ""Goodfellas"" is one of the few films that can be put out with no bonus materials and still be great. The movie alone is enough to warrant 5 stars.Now that that's out of the way, onto my main point, this is one of the best movies ever made. In the 13 years since this movie came out, few other films have been made that rival the greatness of ""Goodfellas"". This is one movie that has, and will most likely continue to stand the test of time.As you've probably heard, the movie is based on a novel (""Wiseguy"") by Nicholas Pillegi. It follows the rise and fall of mafia soldier Henry Hill, from his mob beginnings in the 1950s, to his eventual demise in the 1970s. One of the key aspects of this film is that it portrays the mob in a more realistic fashion than a lot of other movies do. Some films depict mobsters as bloodthirsty criminals who live only to kill, but this movie manages to capture something that many others do not ; a mobster's job isn't to kill people, a mobster's job is to make money. The killing that they have become so well known for is just a small part of that. ""Goodfellas"" doesn't show it's characters as the inhuman killing machines that many crime movies do, instead the characters are shown to be fairly normal individuals. This is where a lot of the appeal lies in this movie. People like to see things shown in a new way, and that's exactly what this movie does. It shows that criminals aren't really all that different from any one else. Henry's wife, Karen, explains much of this in an excellent monologue about half way through the movie.Some will say that this film glamorizes organized crime by showing all the perks of the criminal life; the money, the clothes, the cars, the respect, etc., but I think that in many ways this movie is actually very anti-crime. While Henry and his criminal cohorts do experience success, they ultimately pay the price for the lives they lived.As for the cast of this movie, they're absolutely outstanding. Liotta gives one of the best performances of his carreer, and De Niro is excellent as usual. Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco also turn in great work as supporting characters. As for Joe Pesci, he received a well deserved Academy Award for his performance. Watching the movie, you can really see the intensity Pesci provides as Tommy, Henry's maniac friend. Every time I watch this movie, I develop even more appreciation for Pesci's work. The direction is also spectacular. This is the movie that introduced me to Scorsese's work, and he's been my favorite director ever since. It's incredible to see the amount of work that he put into every frame of this movie. The stretch in the restaurant (I think it's the Copa Cabana) is some of the best photography I've ever seen.This is one movie that is definitely worth owning on DVD. A lot of movies lose their effect the more you watch them, but it's been my experience that the more I watch this movie, the more impressed I am by it. I love it more with every viewing."	5.0	More a review of the movie itself than the DVD	2003-06-22	0	0	0

I think that shortly after the making of this movie Mr. Liotta had some problems with &#34;having too much fun&#34; and almost ruined his career but he is now appearing in more and more really good movies.

Ray Liotta will probably never have a greater role than this since he has since fallen into doing B-movies or straight to video features. And Joe Pesci's Oscar performance as a psycho hood ranks up there with the best of Cagney. A little long perhaps but filled with juicy details of the mob and of course, DeNiros excellent performance. Also the HD DVD version of this classic adds a certain sheen to it all, though on Casino, it's even better"	5.0	Marty's Fellas	2008-05-07	2	2	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A22IE18GWB5A7O	Derek Lipman	Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a long movie that feels short, thanks to memorable characters, a blazing soundtrack, and expert pacing that only the director is capable of pulling off. The screenplay is so good, that watching episodes of the Sopranos evoke great memories of this film. In fact, any Italian mafia flick that came out after Goodfellas borrows (or steals) at least a little bit from Scorsese and Pileggi. Ray Liotta's narration is perfect. It is as good as Dreyfuss' wonderul narration in &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and is peppered with comedy, poignant emotion, and heart.&quot;Goodfellas&quot; practically made Pesci's career with his explosive performance as Tommy DeVito. Here, Pesci forever silences the theory that short, little guys can't be tough. Robert DeNiro shines equally as the Irishman Jimmy Conway with his famous &quot;Little Bit&quot; scene.The supporting cast of characters is top notch in the tradition of Scorsese with Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, and Frank Vincent creating memorable performances. If you haven't seen Goodfellas, buy it! It changed the way Gangster films were made, as it added a little comedy to the gritty criminal subject matter.	5.0	The Quintessential Gangster Film	2004-05-12	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3D99W4ATG4BC2	DJ	The beauty of Goodfellas is that it elegantly crystallizes all the tropes and themes inherent of the mafia/mob genre. The performances are high octane (Liotta) or elegantly understated (Deniro). As a tale of self-invention turned self-immolation, it is quintessential Scorcese.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2J6AMNSPJ8G2	DJ Siniestro	I recommend to buy Goodfellas (Two-Disc Special Edition) directly and skip this cheaper version.This movie is a classic, yet Warner Bros does not value its customers at all. Once again, they put up for sale a crappy DVD packaging, only for later release a better version and make you buy it again just because you weren't satisfied with the first one. This version has only one disk which is double sided. That is not the problem, though. The problem is that it stops in the middle of the movie and you have to get up and turn it around because the second half of the movie is on the other side. Kind of reminds me of the old audio-cassettes.At any rate, the two-disk version does not experience this and has a lot more extras, you'll be much better off.	3.0	Great Movie, Bad Packaging	2007-03-01	1	1	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	"GoodFellas is on top of my ""best films of all time"" list.  I was one of the people who had bought the previous DVD edition, the infamous ""two-sided, no features"" release that had been one of the first generation of DVD releases, before the medium evolved into what it is today.  I had been counting the days until they would re-release this film, so I was first in line to get this new edition.Unfortunately, though this edition is much better than the previous one, it very much pales alongside most modern DVD packages.The package aroused many suspicions in me that this was a rush job.  Among my dissatisfactions:- There's no booklet, leaflet, film histories, or printed material of any kind which generally supplements a two-disc release like this;- The film is long, but still under the three-hour mark, and the second disc has three short (eight to 20 minutes), unremarkable documentaries plus a storyboard-film comparison.  Wouldn't all this material have fit on a single disc?  Dragon:  The Bruce Lee Story had three times the media and was only a single disc.  If they didn't have enough material, why did they put up the illusion that there are two discs' worth?- There are only two commentaries, and one of them isn't even complete.  The ""Cop and Crook"" commentary is interesting, applying the great idea of bringing back Henry Hill (on whose life this film and its source book Wiseguy were based) and the prosecutor who had sponsored his Witness Protection Program, Edward McDonald.  It's not a very illuminating commentary, but it's still good to see what Hill is like today.  However, the ""Cast and Crew"" commentary is suspect.  Not only does it not cover the entire film, I actually suspect it was not recorded as a commentary, but edited from fragmentary interviews.  So rarely do the cast and director on this track comment on the specific scenes, the way a commentary should, that I don't think they were watching the film as they were speaking; I think the production company simply mixed the sound louder and created the illusion that this was a commentary track.  I don't know for sure if this is the case, but if it is, I consider it very dishonest marketing.  Don't call it a commentary unless it is one!- I found absolutely no new insights into Martin Scorsese or the film from the additional materials.  The ""making of"" documentary is the usual ""heap praise upon the director"" baloney.  Come on, do we actually *need* you to tell us that Scorsese is great?  How about giving some anecdotes and insight into the film instead?All of the above adds up to a very underwhelming DVD release of a film that's possibly the greatest American film of the last 20 years.  However, there is still one incentive to own it -- the entire film is contained, without interruptions, on one disc.  So unlike with the old DVD release, you can actually watch the whole film now without having to turn the disc over.  So this is still the best available version of the film out there.  However, I remain displeased.  After years of waiting, and being disappointed, why does this edition fail to satisfy?I can only hope that the impossible would happen -- that Warner Bros. would let The Criterion Collection take a stab at this film, and do it justice.  It will never happen, but the very idea does whet the appetite."	3.0	A suspect DVD release for a classic film.	2004-08-20	95	77	18

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1ZH086GZYL5MZ	Doug DeBolt	Martin Scorcese delivers one of the best movies about organized crime ever made in &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; due in large part to the intense portrayals by an excellent cast. Ray Liotta is completely believable as Henry Hill, an Irish-Italian who becomes a key player in the New York mob. He is befriended by other mob insiders -- Jimmy (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom give Oscar-caliber performances. The pace of the movie is so frenetic that you may begin to feel your pulse rise, particularly during the climactic buildup near the end. In addition to gritty performances, the groundbreaking cinematography in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; makes this a visual treat for the eyes. The only negatives are the sometimes overwhelming violence and language, which are realistically and graphically portrayed but still sometimes hard to watch. Even so, this is one of the best movies to be released in the past half-century.	5.0	A very violent, very gritty film...	2002-04-01	3	3	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AQIRBENYADT43	Eddy	No-one but Martin Scorcese could have created 'Goodfellas'. When it comes to the mood, tempo, soundrack and social setting of a film, no-one can hit everything as pitch perfect as him.In 'Goodfellas' we are thrown into the familiar world of the Italian mobster. Although it is a scene that has been visited many times in the movie world, 'Goodfellas' still manages to raise the bar throughout this genre, and, to this day, still outclasses its long line of imitators.The casting is one of the best and most enjoyable parts of this movie. The interplay between Liotta, De Niro and Pesci is a wonder to behold and their chemistry does jutice to an excellent script. On top of this is an impressive narrative told through the lead character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Often narratives can be very heavy handed and lack subtlety, however this one fits the bill perfectly.'Goodfellas' is essentially as close to perfect as a mob movie can get. It is quite possibly the best movie that Scorcese or De Niro ever made, and that is really saying something. Enjoy.	5.0	As good as Scorcese always is	2007-02-22	2	0	2

An overlooked cameo in this film is the portrayal of the wives of the mobster-goodfellas - shallow, crude,gaudily made-up and dressed..the wondrous Lorraine Bracco excepted (her character is Jewish). Almost an insult to ltalian-American women, but we have to keep in mind that the film portrays a very small percentage of them.And now the ""but"": as cited by movie critics, the 'f' word is used at least 199 times in this film and, even tho this is the way the mobsters talked,it can become tedious and a strain on the sensibilities, so be prepared. Me? l'm hardly a prude and  l'd love to see it again, but the constant use of the 'f' word was a turn-off for me, it being both used and abused brutally in this otherwise-marvelous film.

Unfortunately, Warner Brothers has done a fine job of screwing-up our ability to enjoy this masterpiece at home.  The &quot;modern&quot; DVD version of this movie is primative at best.  It is one of the few, single-layered antiques in existence that you must flip midway through the movie.  Pathetic.  They would've been better-off releasing this on Beta.  Sadly, if you are one of the many out there who hold this movie in the high regard that I do, you're obligated to own it - just don't get too comfortable.  Before you know it, you'll be getting-up to flip your &quot;DVD&quot; as if it were an old Earth, Wind and Fire album.  If anyone from Warner Brothers reads this review, do yourselves a favor and release a special edition of this classic.

Please, let's stick to the damn subject, okay? (Maybe they'll release a 15th anniversary edition in 2005.) The DVD is fine.Now, onto the flick. Brilliance. Sheer brilliance. This movie takes you in the life of the NYC Mafia from 1955 to 1980, and follows the life of a young Brooklyn native named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta, who's one hell of an actor) who gets into the mob at a young age (13ish). Along the way, he basically learns how to be a ""wiseguy"": rackateering, extortion, murder, robberies...no stone goes unturned here. His closest friends are Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci, who's unintentionally funny as a little guy who keeps dropping f-bombs left and right), and Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino). Throughout the movie, the viewer gets to witness the comings and goings and comings of the mafia. (If you're squeamish at all, bye. This is NOT the movie for you. Go watch Mary Kate and Ashley instead.) As Henry Hill progresses, his life starts to spiral more and more out of control, and it leads up to the big finish.Anywho, I recommend this one. It may be rather lengthy, but it's interesting the whole way through. Well done."	5.0	"""As far back as I can remember, I wanted to be a gangster.."""	2003-10-07	5	1	4

The base line  for the entire story is with 'Henry Hill', who is Irish Sicilian, growing  up in 'Mob Land' Brooklyn.  He becomes a faithful 'Family' member - a  Goodfella, until something happens to push his cosy enviroment into chaos.  Appearances from the likes of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (Nicky from  'Casino') and Ra Liotta (as Henry), make this a brilliant cast, who really  do make thismovie spectacular.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A4FAPQKQQLJY1	Elite	"""Goodfellas"" is one of those movies I patiently waited for to get a special edition. There were many times I was close to buying the crappy, bare-bones version that was out in stores, but I never gave in. And now I am glad I didn't.""Goodfellas"" is the story of Henry Hill. If you don't know by now, Hill used to work for the mafia. He then ratted out his friends and went into the witness protection program. This movie is his story from his days as a kid up 'till his last days as a gangster. I think the story is very engaging and it's amazing to see how these people live their lives on a daily basis.I just love watching this movie. It's as simple as that. It's got so many scenes that I can recite to my friends. It's a funny movie. It's got action. I mean if I was going to conjure the perfect mob movie in my head, this is what I would've ended up with. And when I say best ""mob movie"" ever made, I am not really comparing this to ""The Godfather"", as I think they are two completely different types of movies.Ray Liotta is brilliant here as Henry Hill. Liotta wasn't a big name at the time of this movie, but he was the perfect choice. And do I even have to mention that Robert DeNiro was fantastic? He plays the character of Jimmy Conway perfectly. Although Liotta & DeNiro were great, Joe Pesci is the one who steals the show here. Pesci plays the crazy, psychotic, out of control (but hilarious) mobster. He has most of the funny lines in the movie, and his character just eats up every scene he is in. No matter who he is acting with. Paul Sorvino plays the boss named ""Paulie"". He hardly ever speaks in the movie, but Sorvino did that intentionally. He is so good of an actor, just his looks and glares reflect what he is trying to say. Lorraine Bracco plays Henry Hill's wife and you can definately see why they picked her for ""The Sopranos"". I loved her here and it was another great casting choice.I remember back when I saw this movie, I really didn't know who Martin Scorcese was. Obviously I do now, but while watching this movie you can really see what an amazing filmmaker he is. Even other popular directors today say the same thing. I hope he takes the time to give 'Raging Bull' & 'Casino' the same type of DVD treatment her gave 'Goodfellas'. Those two movies definately deserve it, as well.Special Features: There are 2 seperate commentary tracks. One is with Scorcese and some of the cast & crew. The other is with Henry Hill & Edward McDonald, a former FBI agent. Both are pretty decent tracks. On disc 2, you get a very good documentary on the making of the film. Then there is a featurette interviewing other well-known directors who talk about the influence this movie had on them and their careers. Then you get a featurette talking about the ""less than glamorous side of working for the mob"". Finally, you get storyboard-to-screen comparisons & a trailer. Overall, this is a very good set of features. I just wish they hadn't made us wait that long for them."	5.0	The best mob movie ever made........	2004-11-11	4	3	1

The differences between this HD edition and the standard edition are not quite the leap of other releases.  Yes, this movie does benefit from the higher resolution.  It just does not pop off the screen like so many other HD releases.  Perhaps it is not meant to shine as brightly when you consider the artistic intent of the cinematographer.  Still other HD editions of dark films such as Million Dollar Baby and (to a lesser extent) Ray, I still think that more could have been done from the encoding side to cring out more details.  Perhaps the length of the movie played a part...who knows.  In any case, my purpose is to review this edition.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AL639TTVGWE9M	"Enrique Fernandez Roberts ""Stray Dog and comm..."	"First, this is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen.  While the Godfather showed us organized crime from the perspective of it's leadership, this movie gives us an intimate portrait of the mob from the ""blue collar"" side.Up until halfway through the movie, we see a young man become involved in a personal love affair with the mob.  We see him learn to hustle, get arrested for the first time, and we see how naive this young man is despite all that he is exposed to.The second half of the movie is the downward spiral.  We see this mobster go to jail, come back to see a different world (one that now involves the federal government's intervention), and ultimately lose everything because of cocaine.Henry Hill, the guy this movie is based off of, joined the witness protection program but left it a few years ago because all the mobsters he knew ended up dead or in jail.  As a plus, Henry Hill's commentary is added to this movie, and we get to hear his reflections on how this vision compared to his real life.To me, the purchase price of this dvd was worth it for the commentary alone.  Henry Hill talks of the mob with a certian sense of longing, but also with the understanding that if he had chosen to stay, it would have cost him his life.  However, his descision to leave the life of a mobster he himself sees as the end of one life and the beginning of another.So, if you already bought this movie on DVD and are wondering if the special edition is worth it, I would argue yes, if only for Henry Hill's commentary."	5.0	Henry Hill's commentary makes this the best version ever	2005-08-25	5	4	1

Hill is a great storyteller in the Italian street tradition -- it's fascinating watching the movie with him. The film ""was all based on the rhythm of Henry Hill's language,"" Scorsese says.The cast-and-filmmaker talk includes almost all of the key talent, whose comments are carefully placed and tightly edited.

Early on in the 50s Henry began doing work for the influential mobster Paulie (Paul Sorvino). He began skipping school and slowly begins making a lucrative living with the mob.  Soon he meets Jimmy Conway (De Niro) who loves to hijack trucks as well as the foul-mouthed, quick-tempered robber Tommy DeVito (Pesci). Over time Henry becomes successful after an Air France robbery and eventually he gets married to a woman named Karen (Lorraine Bracco). However, Henry gets caught up in a murder and he also starts seeing another woman. He still has problems but he begins a lucrative drug trade and the Lufthansa heist is pulled. The heat is on and Henry is eventually caught and decides to rat on his friends. He is then forced to live life as a nobody. I appreciated the period music, voice over, tracking shots, and freeze frames. The language of DeVito and others is tiresome but it shows how inherently corrupt they are.	5.0	Goodfellas (1990)	2013-06-01	0	0	0

"Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the ""best movie ever!"" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason, and nobody thinks Hal P. Warren had talent.Art shouldn't always be uplifting, I understand that (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this ""the best shot ever."" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there.  Even the tracking shots in Sunrise, another much-lauded film I think is nothing special, were genuinely moving and provocative (not like that, you pervs)."	2.0	Not a bad movie, but not that great either	2010-11-29	15	3	12
0790729725	GoodFellas	A1GY4VWXY0747S	FredCritic	"Not that there's anything wrong with The Godfather.  Although its director and cowriter, Francis Ford Coppola, has expressed his dismay with audience reactions to the movie.  Particularly, audience admiration for Michael Corleone (Coppola went to a number of screenings where people actually applauded when the door was slammed shut on Michael's wife, Kay, toward the end of the movie).But I'm not knocking The Godfather. Coppola did not in any way, shape, or form intend to glorify organized crime. It appears that Coppola's primary intention was to criticize corporate America by showing its similarities with organized crime. For example, the movie demonstrated how organized crime's business operations were quite similiar to those of the ""legitimate"" operations of corporate America.At any rate, Goodfellas demonstrated how ugly organized crime could get.  These ""goodfellas"" murdered just about everyone outside their organization that they could get their hands on, and when that wasn't enough, they turned on one another. And selling drugs wasn't enough for them; they got themselves addicted to the stuff as well.By the end of Goodfellas, no one walked away better off then they were at the beginning (and a good many of them didn't walk away at all).  Compared to The Godfather, Goodfellas was completely unambiguous in showing that organized crime is highly unrewarding in any number of ways.Scorsese's last masterpiece to date."	5.0	Antidote to the The Godfather	2006-05-21	10	9	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"This film is certainly one of Scorcese's best although to say it matches the calibre of Coppola's work on ""The Godfather I &/or II"" would be stretching it.  It's a good film though that's based on a true story and succeeds admirably in portraying a no-holds-barred story of what life in the mafia is like and is like a good adjunct to the whole ""Godfather"" franchise.This dvd version though isn't perfect as although the sound quality is good and sounded like it was a Dolby 5.1 Surround setup on my system but the picture quality hasn't been restored leaving a lot of frames with those irritating white spots.  I note that a Blu-ray version has been released and so here's hoping they took the opportunity to clean up the picture quality a little bit more.  No special features of note here as well but overall, if you don't mind the few picture imperfections and if you are not into the making-of documentaries or cast interviews then this dvd version should suffice.My recommendation though is to get the Blu-ray version but if you need to get the standard version, this dvd will do if you can do without the extras.Updated 17 July 2011:As Amazon will not let me review this separately I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is definitely an improvement over the dvd release I reviewed above but as far as comparison with other blu-ray releases that are out there this ranks as average.  The good thing is that they got rid of virtually all the white spots although the vertical scratch line on De Niro's face is still there but overall at least picture quality-wise we get a vast improvement over the dvd.  Sound-wise the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is still good but not a great deal better than the dvd release.  The Special Features section is vastly improved over the dvd with making-of documentaries and even a short interview with the real Henry Hill.  Overall this is much better than the dvd release but it is not perfect and hopefully they will release a future blu-ray version in a nifty digibook format and a more perfect picture quality soon.Verdict: mixed bag but definitely better than the standard dvd release."	3.0	Good Film But Not So Great DVD Version!

As a lawyer, I wouldn't defend Henry Hill if my life depended on it.  If the movie is accurate, he lead all those men to their death to save his own skin when he could have warned them to blow town.  He lead them to Jimmy Burke to get killed and probably blue the whistle on Tommy Disimone to save his own skin.  Just as he was in youth, he was as an adult.  The price he paid to be alive today left a trail of blood that was unnecessary.  If he was any man of principle, when Jimmy wanted him to lead those guys to him to get killed, or when the Gambinos were going to ""make"" Tommy, he should have informed the future victims and went to the authorities.  But, he didn't.  That's probably why he looks like a strung out drug addict, musing about the trail of destroyed lives he left in his path.  That's, of course, dependent upon the assumption of him having a conscience.  Maybe his addiction is just another manifestation of his compulsion to self gratification.  He had best repent ask Jesus Christ to save him from his sins.  If he had no reservations about ratting, why couldn't he rat in such a way that he and everybody could have lived?

0790729725	GoodFellas	AY12DBB0U420B	Gary Peterson	"My five-dollar, bargain-bin movie for last night was ""GoodFellas."" I first saw the movie when it came out in 1990. It was an exceptional movie then and it's just as good now. It was a story of the NYC mobster underground, their ways of doing things and their family ties. The looks of the cast and their social lives were absolutely authentic. Trust me on this one. I was going out with a Sicilian woman at the time, my best-ever girl friend I might  add, and we'd have a lot of social things associated with holidays and so forth. I got used to the ""look."" Then, Theresa and I went to see ""GoodFellas."" We both enjoyed it, but afterwards I remarked about how the people in the cast looked exactly like the people at her social gatherings. She laughed, and replied that it was a bit frightening. Well, I never detected any Mafia ties with her family, but a good-friend mainland Italian warned me to watch myself or I might end up with a horsehead in my bed. Funny experience.In any case, this movie was a quite good depiction of an extended Mafia family. The acting was excellent, The settings were first rate. Everything about the picture was first rate, although I got tired of the continuous pop music background. Even that was authentic and fit, I might add. The gang activity was certainly ruthless, so if you're squeamish be forewarned. The movie goes through the mob activities up  through and including ""The Big Heist."" Here, order and discipline broke down and posed a threat to the entire organization. Those at fault began to pay in an expensive and dramatic fashion. It's a really  first-rate depiction of how a mob operates, and I wouldn't care to be a part of one.Well, what else could I possibly say? It got the ""Best Picture"" award and earned it. One minor irritation was that it was a very long movie and was split onto both sides of the DVD disc. At the break, I was so wrapped up in the movie that I couldn't figure out what the problem was. The disc needed to be flipped. It's the first time I ever had to do that.Gary Peterson"	5.0	Everything About This Picture Is First Rate. Very Authentic.	2013-04-14	0	0	0

There have not  been any equal competitors afterwards, either. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci  give one of the top performances of their whole careers, and that gives  support to Ray Liotta.

0790729725	GoodFellas	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	This isn't my favorite Scorsese film, but it's still pretty damn great, and is perhaps the best mafia film I've ever seen.  The silly though often dramatically effective romananticizing of the mafia that you'd find in 'The Godfather' or 'Once Upon a Time in America' is completely missing here, and we see gangsters for what they almost certainly are, mere amoral creeps at best, and utterly sociopathic maniacs at worst.  This is a courageously unconventional film, as it is largely a biography, and  thus largely without a particular plot, and is completely devoid of any likable characters.  But, it's always interesting, often fascinating and frequently disturbing, and Scorsese creates a consistent sense of believability and reality, even as the events fall well outside the range of our experience.  Still, though Scorsese manages to shape the film in a way that makes it seem somewhat more purposeful and deliberate despite the lack of a central plot, it does have a slightly anti-climactic ending.  Simply put, Hill's sudden downfall is quite a bit less intriguing that his rise.  But, what are you gonna do, that's the way it happened. (More or less, anyway.  I don't know enough of the real details to say how many liberties Scorsese took with the facts, but I'll assume that this has the gist of 'em, anyway.)  The acting is uniformly top-notch, with special note going to Pesci as the murderous Tommy.  He's certainly one of the most unnerving characters to come along in the 90's, and he really seems to embody what I'm told is a sociopath.  He doesn't even kill because he likes to, precisely, he just does it because he just can't relate to others as human.  The suffering of others means absolutely nothing to him, and thus he has no reason to restrain himself other than how it might effect him later.  This is probably the scariest personality type: someone who seems kinda normal most of the time, but who is in fact a complete fraud, a fraud who doesn't really believe in any of the social constructions of the world, but fakes it to get by.  Henry himself is an interesting character, as he displays an unusual detachment from everything around him, as I suppose would true of a great many career criminals.  Being a criminal is just what he does.Authenticity is significant to the narrative, so this film lacks the surreal flavoring of some of Scorsese's classic work, but he still manages enough flair to keep interesting, largely in the form of some long, elaborate tracking shots, a bit of schizoid editing and some sudden freeze frames to go with the narration.  He also pulls the old using pop-songs from the era trick, but for once this just seems to be a natural outcropping of the setting, rather than an gratuitous, distracting device.Certainly, this isn't a film for everyone.  Again, no one is remotely likable, except maybe Paulie, who displays a wee bit more honor than most of the figures, and it's got plenty of graphic, callous violence.  It's not that gory, really, but the cold approach to it will doubtless effect many.  Still, if you're looking for an unconventional look at a disturbing unusual world that is still frighteningly close to home, you can't go wrong with 'Goodfellas'.Grade: A-	5.0	That Tommy guy sure is a jerk	2005-12-23	5	4	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A1FS9R0JXHLHEG	George Annessa	Scorsese delivers a realistic portrayal of life as a gangster in the tough city of New York, spanning three decades, mixing the glamour and violence to create a world that both gratifies and disgusts the viewer. As you learn that violence and murder was no big deal to these people, it was the only way people stayed in line.Robert De Niro, plays Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway. who acts as mentor to Ray Liotta's, Henry Hill, guiding him through the cheap steals and hijacks that fund their way of life. Along with Joe Pesci's psychotic portrayal of Tommy and the ever-looming, Paulie, as the boss; you cannot help but like them.There is no real honour in family of gangsters, it is all about money and once Henry goes behind his boss' back to partake in cocaine dealing with his Pittsburgh connections, it sets off a chain of events that coincide with the end of the gangster era.Joe Pesci delivers a superb performance, which he deservedly won an Oscar for. His temper and natural violence detracts attention from his diminutive size, who can only be controlled by De Niro, in a quiet but effective character role. I believe that Liotta does a good job as the lead character, his voice-over helping define scenes and situations.Scorsese is the real master behind the film, through his camera work and plotting to tell a story about a group of people he both detests and admires.	5.0	A Criminal Masterpiece	2004-06-29	1	1	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A39WL61420S1T6	"Gerald Brennan ""Loves the three Rs: Readin', ..."	"""Goodfellas"" is not only the best mob movie--it is one of the best movies ever made, period.Many movies show you a world you've never seen, a reality far from your own that nonetheless appears convincing and true. But few movies do what ""Goodfellas"" does. When you watch this, you feel more like a participant than an observer: actors speak to you, introducing themselves, talking as if they've taken you under their wing. You, the viewer, actually matter to them--they want you to like and accept and understand them, even as they do things that are unlikeable, unacceptable, and difficult to understand.The movie opens with a harrowing, horrifying scene: a bloody mob murder in a deserted wood, lit only by the red tail lights of a parked car. There are no clues as to motive or meaning; there is only pure, unadulterated brutality. Why, the viewer wonders, would anyone choose to live in a world so horrifying?Henry Hill, protagonist, narrator, and mob foot soldier, shows you why.After the jarring initial scene, the movie jumps back to his childhood, and Henry puts his arm around you and tells you a story. These men may seem cruel and immoral to you, the viewer, but to Henry they are gods. It's the ultimate childhood fantasy: they do what they want, talk to who they want, eat what they want, stay up as late as they want. No parents, no teachers, no cops, nobody to tell them ""no."" It's a glamorous, flashy world, fast and loose, so far removed from the day-to-day grind of Henry's family that he's instantly drawn to it.For the first half of the movie, there's no reason to disagree with that judgment. Henry and his friends grow older but remain young, brash, immature, and beholden to no-one. And they face no consequences for their actions: a judicial slap on the wrist is the harshest punishment Henry ever faces, and even that is occasion for back-slapping and joking. It feels like paradise.Only mid-movie, when we see the lead-in to the initial murder, do we really understand what Henry already knows: this is a world where saying the wrong thing, making a flip comment while drunk at the bar, can get you killed.Henry and his friends continue in this lifestyle even as it eats them up, one by one. Near the end of the movie, Henry is a coked-up washout with no friends and no future, a paranoid equally afraid of police helicopters and burnt pasta sauce. The fantasy life he so lovingly constructed has fallen apart around him, has nearly killed him: objectively speaking, he should be glad to just be alive. Instead, he longs to return to the life. He misses the fun, the power, the glamour. ""Everything we wanted was for the taking. And now, it's over,"" he laments, and he's explained himself so convincingly and pulled you so completely into his life that you, too, understand and lament.This two-disc special edition further blurs the lines between fact and fiction by giving the real-life Henry Hill a chance to comment on the proceedings. The ""Cop and Crook"" commentary features Henry and Ed McDonald, the prosecutor who brought Henry down, observing and analyzing events. It's not a perfect commentary track--there are far too many pauses and dead spaces, and McDonald frequently has to prod Henry into talking--but it's fascinating (and even more so in light of Henry's subsequent arrest on drug charges); one senses that they almost regret the power of the movie, because so many people miss the point, seduced, like Henry, by the flash and the glamour. They also touch on events from the book not covered in the movie, like Henry's stint in the Army and his role in various basketball point-shaving scams. (The other track, featuring Scorsese, Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, cinematographer Michael Balhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, is nothing super special. They spend most of their time talking about how the movie came to be made and how they turned a great book into a great movie, but they also seem somewhat awestruck, overwhelmed by their creation. They've captured lightning in a bottle, and they're at a loss to explain how they did it.) Still, people (like me) who already owned the previous DVD edition of the movie will probably find this new version worth buying, not only because of the ""Cop and Criminal"" track and the good-but-not-great documentaries, but (most importantly) because the DVD is no longer a ""flipper"" and you can now watch the movie from start to finish with no interruptions.Anyway, if you just want to observe mob life, buy ""The Godfather"" or ""Donnie Brasco"" or any number of other great movies. But if you really want to feel like you're living it, buy this; it is a great piece of cinema and an absolutely indispensable piece of crime literature.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1U63WQJYC5DAA	"Geraldo L. Perez ""Time Space Illusion"""	The movie is excellent, so lets get that out of the way. Im only writing about the HD quality of the Blu-Ray transfer itself. I guess I was not blown away by this transfer.Visually, the opening scene was not cleaned up and still has some film noise and white speckles. Color transfer appears fine, although not as vibrant as I would have thought. Audio again is just ok and nothing to get too excited about. I have not viewed the extra content, but it appears to be interesting and most of it may not be available on Special Edition DVD's.When you spend more money than what you would on a regular DVD, you certainly expect the quality to be much higher. I have a 50inch Samsung FPT-5084 capable of 1080p and I use my PS3's Blu-Ray player, so I dont believe my setup is an issue.After seeing 2001 on Blu-Ray, I know what kind of a mind blowing transfer is capable when the right people are on the task of doing it. Overall, I recommend sticking to the standard DVD version until a better transfer is available.	3.0	O.K - Quality Blu-Ray transfer	2008-01-06	7	6	1

Much lesser films have been given the gift box treatment, and the 10th anniversary of this epic work came and went without so much as an upgrade with some extras. However, I cannot say enough about how much I love this film. I wish I could return to the autumn of 1990 and see it for the first time all over again. Such exquisite storytelling! Such compelling acting and brilliant dialogue! And what an OUTRAGE that it was not handed best film and best director oscars on a silver platter instead of a very good but very inferior ""Dances With Wolves""! Deniro and Pesci deliver some of their best work ever, and all of the bit players who fill out the ""crew"" are just perfect. The settings - the cheesy nightclubs with the tacky decor, the even tackier Hill home in the 70s (""Watch the wall with the rock""), the music - you hear George Harrison's ""What is Life"" during the cocaine-fueled copter chase and it works - the frantic editing, all of it clicks perfectly. What's sad is the realization that Scorese will probably never be able to top it, though I have my fingers crossed. This is, to me, the best movie made in the last 20 years and surely one of the best ever made, and AFI should have placed it in the all-time top 10!"	5.0	This film deserves better . . .	2002-07-05	2	2	0

The acting is great as is the cinematography and direction. You really get a good feel for all of the characters.The bad thing is the DVD. This DVD for one does not have any worthwhile Special Features besides a couple of trailers, a couple of actor bio's and a few Production Notes. Where's the directors commentary? Where is the behind the scenes footage? I hope that perhaps they are planning on releasing a Specail Edition because this DVD does not do it justice. Also halfway through the movies you have to get up and flip it over to the other side. What up with that?You could by the VHS for cheaper and not miss out on anything special.As a movies its great, as a DVD I give it 1 star.Here's hoping they come out with a better DVD version.	3.0	Awsome Movie...horrible DVD	2003-01-12	6	4	2

Its about this guy Peter(Ray Liotta) whos wanted to be in the mafia since he was a kid. He did errands for gangsters when he was about 14 years old and loved it. When he gets older he hangs out mostly with Jimmy(Robert Deniro) and Tommy(Joe Pesci)his closest friends. But when Peter goes to jail a couple a times, Jimmy and Tommy think that Peter is going to squeal on them. The only way Peter can get out of jail is to sell drugs. When he sells the drugs he takes the drugs also. He starts having trouble with his wife like beating her. But if the head of the Mafia Pauli, finds out that Peter is selling the drugs , Peter might get wacked(killed). What happens next I can't tell you so your going to have to see it to what happens.

This was one of the first DVD's to be released ever. The Dual-layer disc had not become a reality yet. Today, having to flip the disc seems very 90's. I also think the compression can be improved upon.This is a title worthy of a Special Edition (if they can do it for Kevin Costner's The Postman, I think they can do it for Goodfellas). So hopefully our friends at the WB will work on a re-release real soon. I'll definitely pre-order it as soon as it's announced.	3.0	Goodfellas	2002-04-12	1	0	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2U0WL1D6SRTO3	Gregory Saffady	"John Wayne and John Ford had the great calvary trilogy in the 1940's.  Ford knew the American West like no other, so it was only natural that he immortalize it on film.  Ford was idolized by Scorsese (THE SEARCHERS are featured in the movie theatre sequence in MEAN STREETS), and Marty is the undisputed champion of mob movies.  Let him emulate the master with his mob trilogy. With 1995's  CASINO, now 2/3rds complete.  GOODFELLAS is a masterwork that yet again redefined American gangster films (holding the crown until DONNIE BRASCO set its own mark in 1997).  The superstar set, both in front and behind the camera are present.  There are few aside from Nicholas Pileggi who can ink underworld tales and only players like DeNiro, Pesci (brutally horrific as Tommy) and now Ray Liotta (this role made him a star) can bring them to life in all their vileness.  And of course there is the trademark Scorsese camera angles to add to the already powerful aura:  the run through the kitchen of the Copa and DeNiro standing at the edge of the social club's bar:  Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" blasting behind him.  Marty's telling of John Gotti would be the appropriate point on the triangle. Just as they did with TAXI DRIVER in 1976, and RAGING BULL in 1980, the Academy again played it safe and denied this Scorsese classic the best picture Oscar for 1990. That's a trilogy Hollywood should regret."	5.0	I'M WAITING FOR MARTY'S TELLING OF JOHN GOTTI	2004-06-04	0	0	0

This is my favorite Scorsese picture, one of the best gangster movies ever made, and the film that Marty should have won an Oscar for.  It may not have the autumnal darkness of The Godfather films (at least one and two), but it has an exhiliartion and love of the medium that the Godfather films lack.  This is Scorsese's most cinematic film, where the camera work (by Michael Ballhus) is quite amazing to behold.  The unbroken shot when Ray Liotta and Lorraine Braco walk into the restaurant is as classic as they come.  It is one of many classic moments in a film that's filled with them.  The 2 1/2 hours fly by, and the film doesn't really sugarcoat the gangster life in any way.  No moralizing, no preaching, Marty just shows you how it is.  The V.O. narration works brilliantly here, and every performance is perfect.  Pesci (who won an Oscar), De Niro, Bracco, and Liotta (whatever happened to him, eh) should be commended for their work here.  Forget The Departed, this is Marty's masterpiece, the won he should have won the Oscar for."	5.0	My personal favorite of Scorsese's work, one of the most amazing mob movies ever made....	2008-01-09	3	3	0

I guess the title is a bit of a joke, because these are violent and horrible men- nothing ""good"" about these ""fellas"". For those who don't know, it is a Mafia movie.A lot of scenes really made me a little sick. But since it is a true story, it must be seen. Like the nudity in ""Schindler's List"". You just have to grin and bear it in the name of authenticity.What I did like were the peformances. I am a big DeNiro fan (especially ""The Fan"" and ""Awakenings"") and he doesn't disappoint here at all. He is volatile and dangerous. The real scene stealer though is Joe Pesci from ""Home Alone"" and ""Vinny's Cousin"". He is unbelievable. I don't know if he got an Oscar at the Academy Awards for this, but he should have.I learned a lot about life in the Mafia from this film.

They pull of many jobs, kill many people (some of them were not good moves and lead to big trouble with the mob), and in the end almost everyone they're attached to, and eventually get into cocaine distribution and get busted when one of them Rats on the others and take down the whole organization.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3W4EW7QAALWG9	Henry Zeno	Scorcese is good.  But most of what he does I find excessive.  &quot;Raging Bull&quot; and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; are two of the most overrated films ever.  The only really outstanding Scorcese movies are &quot;Mean Streets&quot; and &quot;Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.&quot;  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is very entertaining--it's funny, how is it funny, it makes you laugh?--and there are certainly some classic sequences.  But it falls short of being a truly great film because the character of Henry Hill is never fully fleshed out.  He's a device--he provides a foil for Pesci and DeNiro, and his voice-over is the frame of the movie.  But his response to the violence around him is never quite made clear  (as in the scene where Pesci shoots Spider).  The acting is fine, especially Bracco, who is at her best and sexiest here.  I find Scorcese's use of rock and roll music excessive, too--it's too easy to crank up &quot;Monkey Man&quot; as a commentary on Henry's cocaine business.  &quot;Jump in the Fire,&quot; however, does work well in the famous helicopter sequence.  And this is a great movie about the connection between food and crime.  Still, Scorcese's films are too much technique for too little real content, and, in their obsession with technique, emptily portentous  (this trait he shares with Tarantino, whose best movie, &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; is his most restrained).  I don't think Scorcese will ever top &quot;Mean Streets.&quot;	4.0	Good, But a Little Overrated	2001-12-07	4	3	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1DXE58OO7RBG9	Hildegrim	Goodfellas is an outstanding movie.  I have heard quotes from it and references to it for many years.  It is a movie that you won't soon forget.I gave it 4 stars not because of its qualities but for how its qualities matched my expectations for a movie of its type.Based on references I had heard to Joe Pesci's famous clown tirade, I thought it might be a comedy.  Goodfellas is not a comedy.This is a violent movie.  There are frequent violent confrontations, beatings, shootings and graphic mutilations.  This violence is consistent with the story and it supports the lessons of the movie but it can be a little overwhelming - even for someone who loves MMA and the UFC like I do.  Unlike MMA, this violence is usually carried out on unwillingly victims who are unable to defend themselves.  Many of these victims are actually friends of the assailant.There are many conflicts (not all violent) between the protagonist and other characters (especially women) that are never resolved.  This is, once again, consistent with the theme of the move but it is still disquieting.Like all great movies, Goodfellas will provide entertainment and insight to anyone who sees it.  If you are sensitive to the concerns listed above, however, you may want to proceed with caution.	4.0	It's All That	2013-10-26	1	0	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	ABFJYHVD8RHLE	Hillary	"The rise and fall of turn-coat witness protected ""wiseguy"" Henry Hill, is portrayed perfectly by Ray Liotta in this biopic of sorts. Frankly, I am surprised Liotta's career didn't explode after this. Then again, ho-hum ""Dances With Wolves"" beat this film as 1990s best, so you can't explain taste in Hollywood.All the performances are powerhouse here. Robert DeNiro plays Jimmy Conway, a close associate, who can't ever be a ""made"" man because he's only half Italian.  He plays his part with a perfectly cold calculating ruthlessness.  He's loyal until the Luthtansa heist he masterminds is exploited by all the associates involved.  Conway is adamant about telling each person not to show off.  Several don't listen, so he offs each offender one by one. There is a shocking scene where an associate who buys a flamboyant Pink Cadu is soon parked under a bridge murdered behind the wheel, wife at his side. We're treated to the shocking visual as the piano tacet ending of the song ""Layla"" booms in on the soundtrack.  This is only one of many examples where Goodfellas, has the right song for every scene.  DeNiro's best scene is where he finds out one of his friends is killed, (I won't say who in case you've not seen this somehow),  and he is so overcome with emotion he cries hysterically while smashing a phone on the glass of an old fashioned outdoor ""Superman"" phonebooth and then knocking it over completely with an angry shove.  Can that really be done though?  Aren't they attached to the ground?Joe Pesci is sociopathic extraordinaire Tommy DeVito. He's so unhinged, the slightest insult turns him deadly, and there's nothing too grisly for him to deal with.  He has no compuntion about exhuming decayed bodies while talking about eating sausage and peppers.Henry Hill played by Liotta is more of a lover than a killer in this movie, often shocked at the violence of his associates, and preferring to keep a stable of girls on the side, much to the constant anger of his nice jewish  wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco.  Piles of cash keep her quiet for a bit.Perhaps my favorite scene in the movie is when Billy Batts, a made guy, insults Tommy in a bar while having drinks. Billy, played by mob movie regular Frank Vincent, tells Tommy to ""Go Get your f-ing shinebox!"" He insults his position, reminding him of when he was a shoeshine boy.  Jimmy and Henry drag Tommy out of the bar seething, but return before Billy leaves. They wait until the place is empty, have a few drinks like  friends, and then Tommy and Jimmy  literally stomp Billy to death while Henry watches in shock, to the tune of Donovans 60s classic ""Atlantis.""  This song is so perfect for this scene for no reason I can think of, but it just  works.From Henry's early days as a wanna-be errand boy for well played mentor and fatherly boss Paul Sorvino, to his rise as a close non-made associate, and ultimately his fall as a busted paranoid coke head, there's not a badfella moment in the two and a half hours running time of this film.One flaw is at the point where Henry is first seen all grown up, and starting his Goodfella life. Henry and Tommy are leaning against a '65 Chevy Impala and the subtitle says ""Idlewild airport 1963."" Even for people who don't know cars, we've all seen enough rap videos to know what a '63 Impala looks like!!  A silly blooper, but it doesn't take away anything from possibly the greatest mobster documentary style film ever lensed."	5.0	THE Best Mob Movie Ever Made.	2001-11-11	17	8	9

0790729725	GoodFellas	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	I am not a fan of Martin Scorsese . He is a very talented film maker but with his last works he seems to be in a zero atmosphere . From Cape fear to his last work ; something 's wrong seems happen .But fortunately before this strange path happened , he made his last giant work .Warning that 1990 was a battlefield in the mob movies ; this one ; Godfather III (the worst of all the saga) ; State of grace and the best of that group (Miller's crossing) .Goodfellas is an extraordinary organic piece . Filmed with artistic commitment but also with a superb flowness and naturality that it lets you astonished .Scorsese adds a high dosis of black humor in all his characters . They are all involved in such kind of divine madness , that you copnsider the sucesive murders as something completely natural .What can we say of De Niro in this role . When De Niro works with Scorsese , there is something inside the soul of Robert which seemed the happy result of that &ntilde;ong chemistry among them through the time . De Niro is not the same poweful and natural actor under other director . This rapport is so clear (Casino , Mean streets , Taxi driver ; Ragging bull ; New York , new York)that it looks like more than evident to conclude this overwhelming phenomen is just casuality .Pesci is so great , so cynical and Ray Liotta in his finest role to date .The film is artistic a real jewel . They are good kids , good sons , they are excellent gourmets and unique husbands , and they do their job as you or me ; they kill and you can refy}use this behavior ; but for them is a matter of living . That is their job . So what's the point with that ?If I had to take two films of Scorses to the desert island ; I would take this and his masterpiece : Taxi driver .	5.0	A superb tour de force !	2004-09-28	2	0	2

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3GZFBXB2VOGI0	H. Lim	Some day this film will be recognised as one of the five or six greatest films of the 1990s.I watched this film practically by accident, only half interested in the film that was famous for being one of the best of the gangster films.I watched the first scene - the scene with the Mafia guys driving around with a corpse in a car - mildly interesting, and certainly a gangster film.But then - all of a sudden - the film freezes in a view of Henry Hill's face. And the unforgettable first line of narration is spoken: &quot;As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster&quot;.From that point on the film is an absolute joy - a procession of scenes that are incredibly inventive and whimsical in style, over the most amazingly perfect soundtrack.Although it is a masterpiece, it is also incredibly, unbelieveably funny. And not just in terms of gags or one-liners. The whole film has this cynical and anarchistic joy - such as whenever Henry Hill narrates. I believe the narration in this film, by Ray Liotta, is the funniest and best I have heard (Fight Club a close second). He is always ready with smart comments: when the mob beats up a mailman for delivering truancy notices to his house, he remarks calmly: &quot;That was it. No more letters from school - no more letters from teachers - in fact no more letters from anybody. Finally my mother had to go down to the post office and complain!&quot;First person narration in films is the hardest kind of dialogue to write, because the narrator is essentially talking to nobody - except the audience. The narration in Goodfellas is particularly noteworthy because it isn't actually written, at all. Actually, almost every word spoken by the narrator comes directly from the words of the testimony of Henry Hill as recorded by Pileggi in &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, the book upon which this film is based! The charming bit of dialogue about the mailman is directly from Henry Hill's mouth.There are countless memorable scenes in this film; the whole childhood montage; the scene showing wiseguys getting lobsters and red wine in jail; the montage showing Jimmy Conway's murders (including Frankie Carbone in the freezer truck!). The film's style is made more amazing because, like the narration, it is extremely realistic. The detail is incredible; and very true to the reality. Like Band of Brothers, the extreme attention to detail is carefully wedded to a masterly sense of drama. Real life, even for a gangster or paratrooper, has to be very carefully manipulated to be interesting. Scorsese does the impossible and makes a film that is at once baldly realistic, and highly contrived. It shouldn't work so well - but it does.Overall, Goodfellas is a masterpiece of cinema that will probably be recognised more as such in the future.	5.0	Masterpiece of the 1990s	2004-01-18	1	1	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AEEBJAUGUNSJN	Holier Than You	This is as close to an ideal movie as you're going to get. It's based on a fabulous book (Nicolas Pileggi's Wiseguy), has an excellent script, a good soundtrack and features outstanding performances from Ray Liotta, Robert De  Niro and Joe Pesci.I've heard Goodfellas compared to The Godfather over  and over again, but that comparison doesn't work for me. I actually found  it to be the anti-Godfather. Goodfellas is much more gritty and real. It  depicts the same violent, dangerous world that The Godfather did, but with  all the grandeur stripped away. The harshness of Goodfellas will almost rub  you raw at times, but in many ways its more rivetting than The Godfather  because of its almost complete lack of sentiment. This is definitely a  gripping, intense movie that will hold your attention for its entire 2 1/2  hrs.Though Goodfellas is categorized as an action movie and does  contain the requisite number of fights, explosions, etc., it's actually  much more finely nuanced and psychologically complex than what you'd  normally expect from this genre.Ray Liotta's performance as Henry Hill  is skillfully understated. You can really feel his ambivalence about the  life he's leading and the people in it and his transformation from a street  smart kid into the burned out, coked out loser he turns into is really  disturbing. Henry literally self-destructs.Joe Pesci delivers an equally  powerful performance as sociopath Tommy DeVito. Tommy is so remorseless  that he casually discusses cooking while burying one of the unfortunate  victims of his lightning-quick temper. It's Tommy's non-chalance that makes  him so frightening.Robert De Niro is wonderful as well as Jimmy Conway,  a man whose charm and congeniality mask his icy heartedness. Jimmy makes it  so easy to like him and trust him, yet he betrays everyone who makes that  mistake. Beneath his seemingly sincere good will is pure self-interest.  Jimmy does what's good for Jimmy. Period.Part of what I thought made  this movie so interesting is the relationship between Henry, Tommy and  Jimmy and how they react to the same events. Jimmy never, ever loses his  cool or his surface lustre while the evil in Tommy feeds on itself and he  becomes more evil. Henry, however, degenerates and falls apart. This is  what makes Henry the only sympathetic character and the one whose  redemption you'll hope for. Will Henry be redeemed? You'll have to watch  Goodfellas and find out for yourself.	5.0	Scorcese at his best	1999-12-07	27	22	5

I know Goodfellas deserves more than this pathetic slipshod reissue.Wanna know the best thing about this ""special edition""? The best thing is I don't have to turn the disc over anymore to watch the whole movie. The next best thing is that this edition has a cop/robber commentary with Henry Hill and Ed MacDonald, the DA who got him into the witness protection program and prosecuted Jimmy and Paulie. They do the commentary together. Hill and Macdonald have a history, so the conversation really flows. I have to admit it is a great extra.It's worth the price just to hear Henry's and Macdonald's comments on all the scenes, real life characters and actors in the film from both sides of the street.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3LY5FW9I1QJ5N	Internal Abbatoir	Goodfellas is without a doubt one of the greatest mafia movies of all time. The movie is also arguably the peak of the careers of Martin Scorsese, Joe Pesci, and Robert Deniro. Goodfellas follows the story of Henry Hill -- a mafia grunt who has dreamed of nothing but becoming a gangster ever since he was a kid. The film follows Henry's transformation from an ambitious kid to a lowly rat trying to save himself from the very lifestyle he romanticized.In the end, there is not much else that needs to be said about this movie.See it now.	5.0	Goodfellas	2006-07-30	8	6	2

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2O0B5WRBW9NAB	"I. Thomson ""The music, book and film fanatic"""	(Warning: Goodfellas contains strong use of profanity, graphic violence and a number of murders)Based on Nicholas Pileggi 1987 auto-biographical novel, originally titled Wise Guys about Henry Hill's real life escapde in the mafia guided by mentor Paul Cierro from 1955 to 1980.Henry Hill fantasies an opportunity to become a mobster seeing them play their cards across the street in the local Italian cafe every night through his bedroom window. Soon, after his start of a dedicated part-time job parking cars for them, he is involved quickly with Paul Cierro and turns into a reality.........Goodfellas a stunning concotion of music, madness, drug addiction, obession, murders and risk-taking all seen through the eyes of Henry Hill, a sort of outsider and informer. The film adaption bears wear to the novel, even if sections of his life are cut for time which might slow down and drag like Henry's entire time being drafted into the US army in 1958/59; serving time in Allenwood as part of the remainder of his time at Lewisburg from 1974 to 1978; changes to character names such as Jimmy Burke who became Jimmy Conway in the film; Paul Cierro's time spent behind bars in the early days and Henry funding for Karen and her daughters who live in muliple housing including cramp conditions as opposed to the house Henry bought for them after his parole release in the film from Lewisburg in 1974.Goodfellas appears very slick thanks to the well artililated and researched narration holding each and every single scene together to keep the flow by Ray Liotta which he studied off tapes of the real Henry Hill to capture the voice, mood and essence of mafia life. The editing of Goodfellas keeps the story intriguing with the use of freeze frames and chapters only an example to highlight the fast paced lives the characters lead and the dangers they are always exposed to as a moment to take breath, also to refresh your mind, the next moment it starts again nice and easy. Scorsese shows his taste in popular music with the Rolling Stones, Cream and Eric Clapton shaping up the content. The songs mirror the accurary on the scenes. For example, a short extract of Sunshine of our love is played just as about Jimmy is to light up with a big smile upon his face which was to emphasise he was having the time of his life about to give someone their just desserts. Another example, Leader of the Pack was to emphasise how the girls at the beauty palor said Ginny couldn't survive without her husband who stood up for himself but was caught and how later on it is suggested that he is treated as a past love, but never forgotten which is metaphorically like the final outcome of the lyrics.Goodfellas is apparently still standing as a modern classic seventeen years on, after his original theatrical release, which nearly didn't receive because of the distasterous test screenings. Buy today and never regret, you don't get a film as entertaining, humourous, realistic or as scary as this one.	5.0	"""To be a gangster was better than being the President of the United States......."","	2007-08-10	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2TOX3E4WZ8BSQ	"Ivan K. Samuelson ""Bolski"""	First off, the reason I have the subject that I do is because, the current DVD that was released back in 98 doesn't allow you to watch the movie in one sitting. You have to get up and flip the DVD over! Bad move!With this edition, that's all gone. Plus, you now have commentary as well as a second DVD with various special features that will bring to light what it was like to make this movie.For those complaining that these mobsters were dumb, then you've watched WAY too many Godfather movies. I love the Godfather movies as well and I own the DVD collection of it. However, the Godfather is a Hollywood glamorized vision of the perfect mob life. Plus, that was during prohibition and Goodfellas takes place after the fact, when being in the mob definitely didn't pay.Goodfellas shows what it's really like to be connected to the mob. In fact, the mob has ALWAYS been ripping itself off. How else does it make money? Extortion can only go so far. So, it rips itself off from it's company fronts to collect on the insurance. It's pretty pathetic and shows that mob life is not glamorous.Eventually, you get guys in the family that get swelled heads and want to make it on their own. This leads to even MORE corruption within the family as well as mutiny.In this case, Henry Hill got greedy and started snorting his own stash. Being in the mob is NOT glamorous and this movie (and Henry Hill's life) is a perfect example of why NOT to get involved in organized (or really, DISorganized) crime. It's not glamorous, noone is happy, and everyone is out to ice the next fella. Nothing good about it and this movie throws it in your face with such grittiness that you begin to feel that you are part of the story. It draws you in, fascinates and disgusts you to the point that you realise that this IS how the mob really is and that it is NOT glamorous and noone wins in the end.All that money (or at least, what they can scrounge up) does not bring happiness and leads to nothing but failure and life ending in a meat grinder or worse.Excellent movie that sets the example for why mobs are not the way of life.As for the special features, the one I really liked the most was the feature that had the real Henry Hill in it. He talks about how it wasn't fun, even though back then, it felt like it was the best way to live. Straight from the real deal, you finally understand that the choices he made were his own and he takes complete responsibility for it. However, as much as the movie might make it seem like he enjoyed it, Henry comes out and states that in reality, he feared for his life every day. He saw how things played themselves out, especially with Tommy around. That was a wakeup call to Henry and he eventually cleaned himself up and got his life straight after going into the Witness Protection Program.The other features on the second DVD are excellent as well, going into the creative process of how Martin Scorsese sets up various angles to set the atmosphere. All in all, 4 excellent features that do nothing but help makes this the best realistic mobster DVD/movie of all time.	5.0	Finally - Goodfellas seen in it's entirety!	2004-08-16	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A39N2LNAKIU23O	"""jackcoleman"""	Goodfellas is a masterpiece of pacing a film.  It moves along so swiftly that you'll be surprised at how long you've been watching it.There's little plot in Goodfellas.  The film serves as an opportunity to experience the Mafia lifestyle firsthand.  We see the highs and the many lows that come with this dangerous lifestyle.Henry Hill (played by the underrated Liotta) is an Irish boy who grew up and into the world of gangsters.  As a boy, he has a romanticised view of the world and this doesn't really change as he gets older.  He sees the Mafia as a cool gang.  However, he's smart enough not to cross any of the trigger happy members.  He only comes close once, funny how?Pesci's Oscar winning turn as the disturbed Tommy DeVito is a horror to behold.  While only being a supporting character, we know trouble is around the corner when DeVito is on screen.  De Niro underplays his role.  His character is a shifty one whose paranoia gets the better of him in the end.Bracco is the emotional centre of the movie.  A Jewish girl, she marries Henry, and becomes enamoured with this world of Pauls and Marys.  Her life gets tougher as Henry conducts numerous affairs and yet she knows she can't live without the financial stability that the Mafia brings.Scorsese's direction is always personal.  He likes to make his presence felt.  And so we get to see tricks like comedic narration (&quot;Johnny Two-Times, because he says everything twice - &quot;I'm going to the bathroom the bathroom&quot;);  twisted narrative, the beginning becomes the middle;  and most strangely, a courtroom confession by Henry delivered directly to the camera.  While some directors overuse their tricks, Scorsese only uses them when they're necessary, when they'll work.He's the best director of his generation and this may well be his masterpiece.	5.0	Funny, how?	2001-09-27	2	2	0

The supporting actors also added to the already great movie, if I am correct I think the black guy in the movie stacks was played by Samuel L. Jackson.  I also do enjoy true stories turned into movies, I think the director did a great job turning the story into a great movie.  I still gave it a 4 star rating because of the actors, director, music and allround great movie to sit back and enjoy time and time again.

The film is itself stunning, with a very unrelenting picture of mob life and the downward spiral it leads to.  To say Scorsese is a brilliant director is not giving him enough credit.  The way he can capture a story, present it in a unique fashion, in this case show the ups and downs of a life of crime, is stunning.  The cinematography is brilliant, the action sudden and violent, as this life must be.  The acting is perfect, and you really understand why someone would turn to crime, its the family and brotherhood of it all.  The film does take some hits as far as a slightly weird storytelling mechanic (the narration is cool, just a little bizarre), but otherwise it is an excellent film and deserves its place on AFI's list.	4.0	Brutal portrayal of a brutal lifestyle	2011-11-07	1	0	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	"A long film about ""Italian"" crime in New York in the 1950-1980 period, and a good one at that. It shows the brutality and the extreme male chauvinism of these gangsters who are ready to sell anything, steal anything, kill anyone in order to make money, and as for killing, to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood, to satisfy their unquenchable hunger for violence. It also shows, rather on the side because it is not the main object, how justice and before it the police are managing their gang-spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the Justice Department for decades rather than going away in  prison for even longer periods of time. The film is well done: Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are quite acceptable. Ray Liotta on the other hand appears slightly weak when confronted to the other two, and he has to be since he is the side-kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them. One shortcoming though: even if the police managed to more or less bring the Italians back in line, the film is absolutely silent about the fact that the various traffics and particularly drugs were then abandoned to another mafia, probably even more dangerous, i.e. the Blacks and the Porto Ricans and other Latinos.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"	4.0	A lot of empathy but maybe slightly too long	2008-04-09	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AGP0LMEHFQITC	"James Lucas Chatfield ""Religion: musician"""	Note: The two stars reflect the quality of this release, not the film itself, which would easily garner a full five stars.Warners has done it again.  This is the exact same disc that was released on Blu-ray before, only with the extra features piled onto a second disc and the whole thing repackaged in a pretty red book.  I think there may be one or two new, but uninteresting features (I think they slapped on a couple of mob-themed Warners cartoons... a tacky move).If you don't own GoodFellas on Blu already, get the earlier release, you'll be saving yourself about ten or fifteen bucks...  or...  you can wait and see if Warners finally does this masterpiece justice and releases it with a proper remastering.  The video transfer on this release is pretty standard.  It looks a little better than the DVD on a side-by-side comparison, but not much.  The audio transfer is even less impressive.  No matter how nice your sound system is, the whole thing sounds like it's coming out of TV speakers.  Not very crisp, and not much separation.  The whole presentation needs a good scrubbing.This movie should be treated as a crown jewel of the Warners catalog, and so far it's been given the same treatment as any other catalog title.  It's an Oscar winner for cryin' out loud!  It's considered by many to rival The Godfather, which Paramount gave a very extensive and impressive Blu-ray release to a while back.  The same double-dip release policy has been implemented before, and I'm sure it will be again.  New Line (Warners-owned) is about to trot out Blu-rays for Lord of the Rings, but they will be the standard theatrical editions, not the expanded versions that fans will no doubt be expecting.So, for now, save yourself some cash.  Don't buy this thing twice, and if you still don't own it, stick with your DVD copy until Warners treats this classic with some respect.	2.0	Shame on Warners!	2010-02-16	14	12	2

0790729725	GoodFellas	ALJGB7XHPFCR	James R. Mckinley	Goodfellas is on of my favorite movies of all time and remains the benchmark by which I compare all other movies. Some movies, very few, are technically better. Some may hold a plot better but none combine the two aspects as effectively. Every character is meticulously developed and the camera work belongs only to Mr. Scorcese. Women may not love this movie as much as men however, Ms. Bracco has given us a strong and important female lead. If you love movies and haven't seen this movie... see it.  This is a great movie, telling of Henry Hill's 30 years in organized crime.  I get teared-up thinking about how amazing some of the scenes in this film are: Joe Pesci asks if Ray Liotta thinks he's funny, Ray drives around in a drug haze, Ray and his girlfriend walk through the kitchen at a nightclub, Ray pistol whips his girlfriend's date who was &quot;all hands,&quot; Ray shows off his new TV, Ray's wife tries to break down the door of his girlfriend's house, Robert DeNiro receives upsetting news on a payphone. However, a great movie like this deserves at least a better DVD. I am hoping that Warner Bros. will release another version with an anamorphic transfer and - oh yeah - the movie all on one side of the disc.  However, the movie is so good, it overcomes the DVD's shortcomings.	5.0	Do you think I'm Funny?	2004-04-21	48	30	18
0790729725	GoodFellas	A34CVPZ30BA4GD	James Robert Dator	Arguably Martin Scorsese is the most underrated director in Hollywood. No matter how good the films are this man makes the academy always overlooks him for the best director award.Goodfellas is another film in a long line where this was the case. The direction in this film is fantastic and the foresight it took to frame some of the shots in the film (namely the car boot scene) are fabulous.The film centres around organised crime as many of Scorsese's films do, but there is something about the characters that make them endering.They're the kind of characters that the viewer doesn't want to be caught, we get to know them so well even though their motivations are so stilted we don't want them to lose. We get to know the charactersfrom early on as we follow the gang from their petty theivery to plane heists.The cast are great Liotta is sparkling, Pesci although always playing very similar characters is great (if it 'aint broke, don't fix it) and De'Niro is fabulous as always. Even the young Loriane Bracco (from Soprano's fame) deserved her nomination for best supporting actress in 1990.Watch this movie if you enjoyed 'The Godfather' films, 'Casino' or love 'The Sopranos'4.5 Stars	4.0	Good acting, good script, good direction 'Goodfellas'	2002-02-19	0	0	0

I didn't believe it until I actually bought this copy of Goodfellas myself, but the production crew of this DVD were gracious enough to stick in their very own intermission in the middle of this 2 1/2 hour film. No, there wasn't one in the theatrical release, but there is an extraordinarily annoying and unnecessary one here. For in the middle of this incredibly entertaining movie it suddenly stops. The viewer must then get up and flip the DVD over to watch the second half of the film. !!!!NO KIDDING!!!! Why didn't Warner Brothers just release this on 8-track!!!! Totally unacceptable!!!! I actually thought I had received a bootleg copy through Amazon and requested an exchange . . . . but the joke is on me, because this is how the studio intended it for home viewing!!!!

0790729725	GoodFellas	ARKMHDYR0CGPA	Jamey Walker	Martin Scorsese's classic mob film has entertained audiences for 23 years now, and it definitely holds up. It totally immerses you in the life of a gangster, and is possibly the most realistic depiction of mob-life ever. Despite this, it's by no means a perfect film. Maybe it's just the countless attempts at similar characters, but the characters seem rather cliched at times. While the acting and direction are wonderful, it really doesn't rise above the subject material. You'll find that you may remember certain scenes or shots in the film, but the characters and situations probably won't really stick with you. It's undoubtably a great film, but not Scorsese's best. It's more than worthy of five stars, but just a tad over appreciated.	5.0	A fantastic film, but a bit overrated	2014-01-16	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A21KPDE64OETJH	Jan De Ruijter	An excellent mafia movie:GoodFellas in indeed one of the best 5 ever made mafia crime movies together with  theGodfather 1 and 2, Casino and Once upon a time in America, in any order. It is also one of the best 5 movies ever. While the Godfather depicts the Mafia's upper circles at the Don level, GoodFellas concentrates on the street level guys who all aspire to once become made guys, hence the much rougher language and cold horrible violence with perhaps some touches of Sergio Leone who years before directed Once upon a time in America and the fantastic dollar movies. All truly great movies have several key ingredients in common one of which is an absolute perfect casting. It is fantastic to see how carefully each and every character appearing in the film has been selected and chosen.  Perfect roles by Robert de Niro and Ray Liotta and of course for many Joe Pesci made the movie. How nice to see Paul Sorvino, Tony Darrow, Frank Vincent, Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico and Vincent Pastore. All these guys act as people did in the late 60's in Brooklyn and Queens. All of them went on to excellent careers and have become familiar faces. Some 20 minutes into the movie the now world famous restaurant scene begins when Pesci wants to know why he is found to be so funny. Scorsese gets all the milage from his actors, many directors have tried to imitate this scene, see for example Training Day but no one came close to the performance by Joe Pesci. The score is also very well selected with some exiting music by Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones matching some of the cruelest scenes. This 2 disc special edition has excellent quality of color and sound and the special features are worthwhile, I am so happy to add this movie to my very special collection and can recommend it highly. Thanks to the great Martin Scorsese and to Amazon for itsalways great service!Jan in Aruba.	5.0	one of the best movies ever	2009-09-22	1	1	0

The colors are dark and rich, great contrast and you can see lots of detail.  The movie has never looked so good.  The movie does have some scenes that show its age, where you can see flecks of dust and marks on the film, but it doesn't detract from the picture, it just adds character.I have seen some other ""classics"" put out on HD-DVD and Blu-ray, even some new movies shot within the last 2-3 years.  Many of these are very soft, and inconsistent as a transfer.  This movie, is perfect, all the way through, the transfer does not disappoint.  It is deep, dark, well saturated, and nothing looks soft, light, or bad.Where this disc shines, is the commentary, you get to hear commentary from Henry Hill (the guy the movie is based on, and FBI agent Edward McDonald) he discusses how the movie really compares to his real life, and he is quite entertaining.  The disc also has a few other bonus features, and the movie trailer, which is nice.All in all, this is an amazing movie, with a fantastic transfer loaded with features.  You cant go wrong with this one, It's great, and for Amazon's low price, it's a steal."	5.0	Goodfellas	2007-12-28	3	3	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A8KDNHIYJ9339	Jason	Goodfellas is without a doubt one of my all time favorite movies. With exception of The Godfather &amp; The Godfather Part II, and of course Scarface. The film is rather long, but it don't seem that way when your watching it. Led with an all star cast of Robert De Niro (The Godfather Part II, Casino), Ray Liotta (Blow, Hannibal), Joe Pesci (JFK, Casino), Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown).The film is about the life of Hank Hill, (Liotta), who from when he is young he wanted to be a gangster, but maybe he asked for more than he was bargaining for. Led with Jimmy Conway (De Niro), and his hotheaded, childhood buddy Tommy DeVito (Academy Award Winner Joe Pesci), they do anything and everything. From robbing loads of trucks, (and all their merchandise), to contract killing, nothing is left out in this true, adapted story, or true life gangster Hank Hill.This movie is one of my all time favorite mob flicks, that made Joe Pesci the star he is today. This film is easily one of Scorsese's best movies.

I would like to point out, however, that Martin Scorsese  has never recieved any recognition for his amazing contribution to American  film by the Academy awards, and that this is a tragedy. It only serves to  demonstrate how much of a joke the Oscars are, unworthy of any serious  consideration. The man has at least three films to his name which deserved  to take home best picture (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, &amp; Goodfellas), and  he has deserved Best Director just as many times. I'm sure he doesn't care  that much - he knows that even Citizen Kane was overlooked when it first  came out - but it must be frustrating to be ignored so consistently. It's  simply not fair for this artist to have to wait until he's near death to  finally be given some lame Lifetime Achievement award. Scorsese is the  closest thing we have to an auteur in America.	5.0	Give The Director His Due	2000-04-12	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1FUSEBAMJV0P2	"""jason_tolliver_2k1"""	You really cant say enough about this &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; mob movie. The movie takes place with Hank Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a young boy who dreams about his life of being a gangster. At a very young age Hank becomes part of the Mafia, and slowly learns about how it all works. From stealing company trucks (filled with merchandise) and peddling cocaine in order to help his family survive. Each and every minute of Goodfellas is a refreshing pace, (unlike most mob movies). With his insane buddy's Jimmie Conway (played brilliantly by Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito** (also played brilliantly by Joe Pesci, who also won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) Hank soon enough gets into more than he bargained for. And well, everyone around him is dying. Im not going to give away anymore details, but its a must have for any mob crazed fan's DVD collection.Led with a brilliant cast of characters:Robert De Niro (The Godfather Part II), Joe Pesci** (Casino) and Ray Liotta (Hannibal).

The colors were brighter and the picture sharper.  A must have to start your Blu-Ray collection.	4.0	Good Blu-Ray Transfer	2007-04-11	3	2	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	AYVFNOQHY8P3	J. Christal	Martin Scorsese created his definitive masterpiece with this film.  GoodFellas has everything and anything I could for in a motion picture, and it is done so well with such enthusiasm, excellence and thought that it boggles the mind.  While it might be on a subject that might not be appealing to everyone, it is certainty worth viewing (I would even put it over the Godfather).The film is about a kid in Brooklyn named Henry Hill, who grows up in the Mafia world not on the inside, but as an outsider looking in, who gets so intrigued by the way they act, the way they get away with anything, everything.  That leads Hill in becoming a bus boy, and then working his way up in the world.  How Scorsese deals with this material (brought from Nicholas Pillegi's novel which he co-scripted with the director) is different from other directors.  He handles it that the man knows the risks, but he doesn't care.  Just as long he can be different, not like other average people.But this couldn't sustain the film alone.  It is elevated from exceptional acting by the whole cast: Ray Liotta in a fine breakthrough as the main character as a adult in his rise, and his eventual fall; Robert De Niro in a somewhat overrated yet good role as Jimmy Conway, one of 2 mentors of Hill with a bad attitude yet with charm; Joe Pesci, absolutely breathtaking with one of the most memorable scenes ever at the table telling his joke and being totally insane while still having the courtesy to have fun doing it (Pesci won the only Oscar for the film in America); Lorraine Bracco in also a great breakthrough as Henry's understanding yet angry wife (probably this is what got her noticed to co-star on the HBO show The Sopranos); and Paul Sorvino as the head mafia chieftain Paulie.Acting helps this film immensely, and of course it is just one part of the film's greatness.  The photography is also awesome, with shots going into the copa cabana being fantastically mesmerizing and simple one's like the shot at the dinner table being simple; it is just another part of it.Martin Scorsese has been able to top them all now.  With a story that is unconventional (much like life, for which it's based on), great acting, directing, writing, photography and jokes, this is a movie that was not seen like this before 1990, it astounded audiences (and still does), and nothing like it will ever some around again.	5.0	The Best Film I Have Ever Seen	2002-05-25	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3PE884TA8529G	J. E. Nelson	"While ""Goodfellas"" is not my favorite movie, it is defiantly in the top 5.""Goodfellas"" is a mostly true story based on the book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi.  The movie very closely mimics the story in the book.  It is about the life of Henry Hill, an associate in the Lucchese crime family.  The movie chronicles Hill's journey through the world of organized crime, starting with a part-time job at a cab stand after school, rising to the heights of stealing millions through participating in robberies and hijackings, then finally how his world rapidly disintegrate after creating a large narcotics empire.  After being arrested for drug trafficking and facing 25+ years in prison, in order to preserve the lives of himself and his family, Hill testifies against multiple associates in the world of organized crime and evaporates into the federal witness protection program.Robert DiNiro and Joe Pesci perform brilliantly, playing blood thirsty, borderline psychotic gangsters.  However, I think Ray Liotta has the performance of his career paying the lead character, Henry Hill, a down to earth gangster who is interested in his women and money rather than killing.  The movie has much less blood than a Rambo movie and very few special effects, yet words cannot express how remarkable the movie is.  To me, one of the best scenes in the movie, the ""You're a funny guy"" scene in the restaurant, has no special effects at all.This is one of those movies has something for everyone, love, deceit, murder, drugs, corruption, graphic violence, humor, and mystery.  The only issue I have with the movie is that a lot of the details the various crime figures use in their conversations did not mean anything to me until I read the book.  Even though the movie is almost two and a half hours long, the movie does not seem that long.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an excellent drama.  This is one of the few movies I think belongs in almost everyone's movie library."	5.0	A Great Story, Great Vision, and Great Actors Make Great Movies	2005-07-20	2	2	0

I was grateful to have my taped off of the television copy for a long time! And stop lessening the stars. This movie deserves a full 5 star rating no matter what the DVD plays like.Anyway, moving on to the film. This is such a success I think because, well, to put it simply, there are no flaws. The incredible and perfect cast had an absolutely amazing script, and they were directed perfectly among other things that made this movie one of the best I've seen, and certainly the best mobster movie. Sorry Godfather (and part 2), but this one has it all. It shows the truth of the mob (which should really make you think) and includes comedy. So you see what their life is like. Not everything is drama all the time, not even in the mob! At the Oscars this movie was robbed and I feel horrible. At least Pesci won, thank god. I could rave for days about this movie, but I won't, just buy it and rave to as many people as you can about it. It's impossible not to!	5.0	Black Comedy at its Best!	2002-08-02	2	0	2

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"Scorcese & Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy is great film. While not my favorite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies.As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatized and glamorized to a certain extent, the essence of this film in my observation is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.The sham of the Mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a ""wise guy"", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organized crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish.The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, is fantastic. Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never loses sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on his usual top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but says a lot through his expressions.This film draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film. 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed!

Here De Niro delivers one of his best performances as an actor and this kind of character fit him so well. On Joe Pesci, this was the first time I saw him on a movie and I really did enjoy his impersonation as an ""beyond good and evil"" ganster. His ""How Am I funny? Funny how?"" Monolog it's one of the best twisted funny moments I have never saw on a movie. Finally, the brand new Ray Liotta as the main character and story teller is simply awesome.

From what I remember, the movie closely follows the book. Guys, wise or otherwise, were getting &#34;whacked&#34; all over the place...Brilliant performances from De Niro, Pesci and Ray Liotta (Who plays Hill) et al.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AQ15WBHSMN3TI	J. Fajardo	The film is one of the great works of the last 20 years and it deserved better than this release.  My rating is more a reflection of the product than the movie itself, which we all agree is a classic.  The picture quality is scarcely an upgrade over the DVD version.First of all, the film has not been restored and cleaned up for HD.  I understand the movie is about 18 years-old and it won't look as clean as, say, Casino Royale does on Blu-ray, but the scratches and damaged film elements present in this transfer are inexcusable.  There are two long film scratches in the movie, one within the first 15 minutes and the other in a scene when Paul and Jimmy see Henry in his apartment, that run in the middle of the frame through the scene.  There are also numerous incidents of bad elements, damage, and dust that detract from the experience.This film deserved better and it should've been properly restored.  To see that kind of damage in a transfer in this day and age just speaks to laziness and a desire to put out a popular product because they know people will buy it no matter what.  It's an insult to consumers and film fans everywhere.Buy only if you must have an HD version in your collection but I'd wait for WB to treat this film properly in the future.

Hill started to work with the mob when he was a teenager and by the time he hit his 20's, he was 'part of a group' as he liked to call it. So begin's the adventure of Hill, even though it has some funny moments, even one's that seem like there heartwarming. But as quickly as they come, they go. The violent part of the life always takes over. Along for the ride is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance)! Tommy is a very quick tempered man, who uses anything around him to get what he wants or needs. Last but not least is Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert De Niro) who is half Irish half Italian, just like Hill! These men although they run their own little business, answer to one man, that is Pauly (Paul Sorvino)! The man who runs the show. But Hill, DeVito and Conway all in all work for him taking over airports, night clubs. Anyone who needs protection but can't go to the cops. They come and see Pauly! Along the way Hill meets Karen (Lorraine Bracco in her Oscar Nominated role) who will be with him all the way. But along the way Hill gets into drugs and seals his own future. No one ever really showed an adict like Martin Scorsese does in this film, never sugar coating anything. This would be the role of a lifetime for both Liotta and Bracco! The film never really slows down, the character development is outstanding, as is the entire supporting cast. With a great director, cast, screenplay and cinematography this film is a sure winner. As always Robert De Niro proved to be a treat, but the real surprise was Joe Pesci! Who was and never has been better than he was in this film! If any film during the 1990's was robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture (other than Saving Private Ryan) it was this film! It should have won for Best Director and Best Picture, but it didn't! You have to see this film to understand everything that has been said about it! It ranks up there with ""The Godfather"" yet never use's anything from the film, making the choice for which is better, very hard. See ""Goodfellas"" and realize that it is Martin Scorsese's best film and one of the best ever made! An Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor(Pesci)! Don't miss it!

Even the romantic scenes where he meets his wife (Lorraine Bracco), an area where directors do an obligatory slowdown, have  a fast pulse.If I can criticize anything about this fine film, it would be-*There is no Harvey Keitel cameo.*The accuracy of the tales of real life mobster/writer Henry Hill are disputed; after all he did become a government informer, and snitches often have low credibility.*There is a coke deal scene in a crummy motel-with the windows WIDE open-guess Marty needed the lighting more than the dope dealers needed their privacy!Regardless of my nitpicks, this is one of my top 20 favorites of all time.	5.0	Hang On to Your Seat	2007-09-19	1	0	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A30IZT5ZEFAUG8	"J. McQueen ""part man/part machine, all scientist"""	I feel that Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS is problably one of the best Italian mob movie ever.Maybe I am biased, b/c I like the main characters (Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci)Also, the fact that the movie is based on the real life of mobster Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) makes the movie much more appealing.The movie shows Henry's life as young boy and shows his life from a mob errand boy to his life and downfall as drug-dealing member of the mob.This is great...enough said.  It should be made required viewing.The film also has:Lorraine Bracco (Tony's psychiatrist on the Sopranos) as Henry Hill's wife; Paul Sorvino as Paulie (a mob boss);  Michael Imperioli (Tony's nephew on the Sopranos) as Spider; and  Frank Sivero as Frankie Carbone.	5.0	Probably One of The Best Italian Mob Movie Ever	2004-06-12	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2MM8CVDKZPUF7	Joe	I will state, as many others that left poor reviews, by saying that I absolutely love this film.It is a piece of modern art, in my opinion.  Great acting, dialogue, cinematography, this movie has the works.  But the DVD itself is so glaringly bad, so godawful, that I must rate this item 1 star.  I consider this movie the best &#34;mob/gangster film&#34; of all time, but even such a title is forever tarnished by this DVD. I'll go through this step by step.First off, the DVD itself.  When they say &#34;dual-layered,&#34; they really meant &#34;dual-sided.&#34;  I'm a DVD aficionado, and I hate dual sided discs with a burning passion.  They're much harder to take care of, they're harder to take out of the case and they're harder to put back in without scratching the surface.  And this is just me, but I like to have a picture on my DVD, I don't want to have to read the minuscule print around the center ring to find out what I'm holding, and I hate having to try and figure out which side of the DVD I'm about to play.  I'd understand if this were done as a cost saver because there is so much material that it couldn't all fit on a one-sided DVD, but as a further indignation, the two sides simply contain the film is in two halves!  There are hardly any bonus-features to speak of, save for a few short biographies and film credits of the actors and the director.  No behind the scenes, no cast interviews, nothing at all.  Just the movie, and some screens with about 3 paragraphs of information about a few of the actors and Scorsese.  Just a double-sided DVD of a film in two parts, so that after you've watched half of the film, you have walk over to your DVD player and flip the disc over.  This aspect of the item is most definitely an abysmal 0/5.Secondly, the menu.  Nothing fancy, it's an older movie so I didn't expect much, but it's awfully bland, an injustice to the least bland movie ever.  I give the sound 2/5The sound is okay, but for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, it doesn't sound that well.  As a matter of fact, it seems that when I watch this movie on Cable the sound is better.  The issue could be my DVD player.The image hasn't been updated to HD, which isn't an issue for me.  This is Goodfellas!  It wasn't meant for HD!  It would have been nice, though.  I watched the film for the first time ever with the subtitles on, which is something I do with all of my DVDs.  Sometimes there are lines of dialogue that the actor(s) don't clearly speak or deliver, so I turn on the subtitles because I want to know exactly what they're saying.  I feel sorry for someone that is hearing impaired and tries to watch this DVD, because the subtitles are wrong in numerous parts!  It's as if whoever wrote the captions was only passively listening and paraphrasing what the actors were actually saying. 2/5Overall, I was sorely disappointed by this DVD.  I wasn't expecting Avatar or some other high-tech HD film, I know that this film is over 20 years old and was made in a time before DVDs.  But the flaws are so glaring, so frustrating, that I would never recommend this DVD to somebody else.  It's a bastardization of a movie that I fell in love with upon watching the first time.  It would be as if the woman you loved, who was as if you were with the most beautiful woman in the world (in your eyes), but then you were suddenly thrown into the future where she's extremely old, decrepit, with cataracts, gray hair, and cancer.  It's heart-breaking and an abomination, leaving you yearning for the past.	1.0	Amazing film, just a lousy DVD delivery	2013-11-15	3	2	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A342MS5RCZCFEH	Joel Harris	This particular item is, unfortunately, one of those early DVDs that you have to flip over halfway through the movie, which is the pits. I thought I did my research thoroughly enough to avoid that, because I was certainly aware that this annoying product was out there, and I really wanted to avoid it.But no such luck. My advice--look very carefully before you buy to make sure you get a good quality MODERN DVD.

OMG, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is at best a well-crafted IMITATION of the number one movie of all time. And Scorsese's best picture? No freakin' way, haven't any of you people seen &quot;Raging Bull?&quot;  That is his masterpiece!  I admit &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is an enjoyable movie, but the only thing memorable about it is Joe Pesci's loud mouth.  By the way, I think it's very sad that Scorsese cloned this movie, set it in Vegas, and called it &quot;Casino.&quot;  What a pile of crap that one was!  &quot;RAGING BULL&quot; IS A MASTERPIECE, YOU MUST OWN IT!  Just rent this one, it's good, but no way would I buy it.  By the way, to all you &quot;THUG LIFE GANGSTA wanna-be's, if you think this movie is &quot;HARD,&quot; check out &quot;American Me&quot; with Edward James Olmos, that movie makes &quot;Goodfellas&quot; look like &quot;Barney.&quot;	3.0	MY GOD!

0790729725	GoodFellas	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	Scorsese's mob masterpiece, which he co-scripted with Pileggi, is an intimate, insider's glimpse into the rise and fall of the Mafia from the 1950's onward. Period music, costumes, and a bold, intrusive shooting style help evoke a heady, secret world of crime without consequences, a world bound to implode. Liotta is strangely sympathetic and all-too-human as Hill, DeNiro frighteningly combustible as Jimmy, and Pesci electrifying as the savage, psychotic Tommy (he nabbed an Oscar for this). Quite simply one of the best crime movies ever made.	5.0	Goodfellas	2007-07-12	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--exploits the life of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film.As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mafia boss Paul Sorvino; and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster, and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems.Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to Henry starting to take and deal drugs, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. There really is no plot per say, as you can see above, other than following the true life story of a gangster. But what makes the film is a witty script, intelligent, deep, and for the most part likable characters; a great director, great actors; the list goes on.Robert De Niro isn't in this movie a whole lot--I'd estimate an hour and a half out of the three or so hours the film is. But when he's on screen he gives a terrific performance.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, ...."" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese, one of the most overlooked directors when it comes to Oscars and other such awards, beautifully directs this gangster epic; with some of his latest films being slight flops (""Gangs of New York""--I haven't seen it yet, but I heard it's average), I think another gangster film is in store for the future.""Goodfellas"" has got everything you go to the movies for: Witty dialogue, great, three-dimensional characters; excellent directing style, and some great actors. ""Goodfellas"" is an offer you can't refuse.By the way, I think it is appropriate to put a bit of a disclaimer on this review: I would not recommend ""Goodfellas"" to those that have a problem with violence and/or language, and ""Goodfellas"" is definitely not one for your kids to watch--it contains extremely strong, pervasive language, and a great deal of strong, realistic violence. I only put this because I am sick of parents taking children to see R-rated films that are not appropriate for children. And this is definitely one of them.Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen.5/5 Stars -"	5.0	An Offer You Can't Refuse...	2003-03-31	1	1	0

The film is more than a docudrama about Italians in organized crime, but a film  showcasing mouth-watering Italian dishes, the close affections of Italian  culture, and tons of hilarity.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AA2OPN09LYNG7	John P. Charet	The reason I am writing another review of this movie is because I spelled some words wrong in my last review. Here is my newreview. Covering thirty years of mob life, this gritty excellentmovie is not only director Martin Scorsese's greatest masterpiecebut it is also the best mafia movie ever made. Based on the novel Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, it features Ray Liotta as thetrue life Henry Hill, an Italian boy from Brooklyn who after seeing the glamorous lifestyles of gangsters decides to become amobster by joining a neighborhood mafia family led by Paul Sorvino. This study on New York mob life is a flawless gangsterthat has the words timeless classic written all over it. I am areal big fan of Martin Scorsese and I find this film that he has made superior to TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, MEAN STREETS, and hispartially inferior CASINO. CASINO can never match the high classand brilliance of this 1990 classic. It was a great injustice that GOODFELLAS lost best picture and best director to Kevin Costner's epic DANCES WITH WOLVES. Even though I love DANCES WITH WOLVES, I thought this film should've won. Oh well, at leastJoe Pesci won best supporting actor for his terrific portrayl ofhair trigger gangster Tommy Devito, which has to be the performance of his career. I can watch this film over and over and never get tired of it. Of all Scorsese films, this one is my favorite to watch over again. This is not just sleek and stylish, but it is also the greatest film of the 90's. Somebodyasked me once what is the best mafia film ever made. I told themGOODFELLAS is the best mob movie ever made and THE GODFATHER is the best mafia trilogy ever made (All three films). Now I only wish Warner Brothers would release a special edition DVD of this movie complete with documentaries and commentary because a tourde force like this deserves first-class treatment. Highly recomm-endes and a must-see. Oh I forgot to mention the film also has terrific performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci,Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.	5.0	Best Mob Movie Ever Made	2003-04-30	0	0	0

GoodFellas is a mesmerizing and epic crime film.The story in Goodfellas is mesmerizing, although you may have seen a similar structure in other gangster films. The story moves at a great pace, and gives just enough to keep you full despite the large period it goes over. There's action, drama, and comedy brilliantly blended into a film that demands your attention. The performances in this film are amazing; I loved both Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, but Joe Pesci really stole the film with his memorable performance (""Funny, how?"") The soundtrack in this film was also great, and helped create the classic gangster atmosphere.Overall, Goodfellas is a spectacular crime drama; the settings, the performances, and the music all contribute to this film's authentic feel and demanding attitude.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A28LG2MEWGLKZW	Jonathan S. Kemp	"""Goodfellas"", director Martin Scorsese's 1990 gangster epic, left an indelible impression on audiences and filmmakers, plunging them into the life of Henry Hill, a small-time New York thug who rose to the top of opulent mob life.  Much like Scorsese's landmark films of the seventies and eighties, ""Goodfellas"" produced new narrative and stylistic techniques which are apparent in modern classics like ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"".""Goofellas"" was released on DVD shortly after the format launched in 1997.  For the last seven years, the only available copy of ""Goodfellas"" has been a wretched, two-sided, featureless DVD.  With so many bad movies available in redone, repackaged, and bloated special editions, fans of the movie have crying for an updated, feature-packed version of Scorsese's classic.  The ""Goodfellas"" Two-Disc Special Edition was finally released on August 17, but is the new version worth buying?The new DVD has remarkably improved picture quality, something that should please everyone, whether they care about the extras or not.  The washed out, grainy look of the original DVD has been completely redone, replaced by a vibrant, pristine transfer.  The sound was thankfully remastered as well; dialogue and music are now properly balanced with each other, so you can watch the film at a consistent sound level without the annoyance of jarring, overloud music and gunshots after a scene of quiet talking.The special features are the most alluring part of the new edition, but they are not as interesting as I had hoped.  The first disc contains two audio commentaries.  Martin Scorsese, Lorraine Bracco, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino, Frank Vincent, writer Nicholas Pileggi, editor Elma Shoonmaker, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, and producers Irwin Winkler and Barbara De Fina participate in the first commentary.While the commentary has an impressive list of names, I cared more for what Scorsese and Liotta had to say than any of the other people.  I was also disappointed that Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci did not participate.  People who are interested in the technical aspects of the movie might appreciate the comments made by the cinematographer and the editor, but the first commentary was boring as a whole.  Scorsese can talk all day about anything regarding film, and I am surprised they didn't give him his own commentary track.The second audio commentary features the real life gangster Henry Hill (whom Ray Liotta's character is based on) and FBI agent Edward McDonald.  Hill's observations are fantastic; he compares scenes in the movie to his own experiences, and hearing him talk about killings and drug deals is startling.The disappointing second disc contains the rest of the extras.  The longest feature, ""Getting Made"", runs thirty minutes, and contains interviews with most of the cast, who do little more than praise Martin Scorsese.""The Workaday Gangster"" is an eight-minute segment with Henry Hill talking about the all day job of being a gangster.  It's just a rehash of everything he says on his audio commentary.""The Goodfellas Legacy"" is the most interesting feature on the second disc.  Frank Darabont, Richard Linklater, Jon Favreau, the Hughes brothers and Antione Fuqua discuss how the movie influenced their own films.The remaining extras are the trailer and ""Paper Is Cheaper Than Film"", the latter being a trite three minute segment about Scorsese's preproduction notes and drawings.If you own the 1997 copy of ""Goodfellas"", and you're not completely in awe of the movie, there's little reason to buy the Special Edition.  If you have never seen the film, make sure to watch the new edition, as the improved sound and transfer is a substantial improvement over the original.Only collectors or adulating fans of the movie should spend the twenty bucks for this disappointing update to one of the best films of the 90s."	3.0	It looks nice, but the extras could be better	2004-10-01	12	8	4

The movie presents to you the lifestyle of the mafia in italy in a powerful dramatic style of film shown through the eyes of a person who was stealing for the mafia as a child and grew up in their atmosphere shows right from the beginning how things worked whilst living with the mob, knowing everyone, having a lot of extra relations, the money and the work they go through in order to get it.As the movie progresses the main character finds things more and more difficult and ends up running for his own life from those who were especially close to him throughout his life.The movie is presented in the best posiible way and is also quite edjucational i give it the five stars and i strongly suggest that you watch it aswell.	5.0	Goodfellas stands tall above mobster movies.	2005-01-16	2	1	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	AR2DE47VCY1C8	"Joseph H Pierre ""Joe Pierre"""	This is a more-or-less run-of-the-mill tough guys film directed by the master of the genre, Martin Scorsese.  One thing sets it apart from the other gangbanger films: it is based on fact--the life of Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a half Irish, half Sicilian punk from New York City who associated himself with the local mob at an early age.From a run-of-the-mill street punk, Hill graduates into bigger scores, and eventually into dealing drugs.  To save his neck he turns government witness, through the Witness Protection program, and burns everyone who has ever known or been associated with him. The feds get him placed in Seattle with his wife and kids, but once a punk, always a punk.  He falls back into his old patterns, and his wife divorces him and he again gets entangled with the law.All pretty predictable.The big boys that he ratted on end up doing time, of course, and so everthing is made acceptable, except... Somehow, we end up with the feeling that justice has not really been done.  He should have been locked up as well.  At least, that's my reaction.The film is of course well done.  But, I thought the filthy language was overdone and gratuitous.  I think a good film could be made, and still get the idea across, using language more acceptable to a general audience.  You wouldn't want to view this one in company with your mother (or any other person you respected.)  That's too bad.We've come a long way since Gable cussed mildly in Gone With the Wind, and everyone gasped in dismay.

This movie always has something going on in so many different circumstances, and draws you into such a sense of normalcy within a completely extraordinarily abnormal lifestyle.The story's narration plays uniquely well throughout the film. And the film seems to morph throughout its ""life"" in a very intelligent manner.Just about every frame of this film can induce positive in-depth discussion...too much to say in a single review - you really should just see this movie for yourself!The HD DVD transfer quality is outstanding! Visually compelling artistic sweeps coupled with production sets and performances that make you feel ""right at home"" give ""GoodFellas"" an unmatched sense of epic realism!There is a vertical mid-screen stripe of missing picture which runs from 1:16:37 to 1:16:42, but upon searching the internet before contacting Warner to ask if it's a disc issue, I find that it has existed since the original theatrical version and has also been present on every other format which the film has been released on so far as well. This does not break the movie by any means - some claim to have never noticed (I don't see how) - I'm just surprised that nobody has taken the time to sit down and interpolate what appears to be a simple fix for a five-second segment of the movie.The DD+ 5.1 audio track is very rich, clear and enveloping...it sounds remarkable, every bit!Extras include two commentaries, three cast and crew documentaries, a storyboard-to-screen comparison and a theatrical trailer.This is a top quality, amazing two hour and twenty-five minute film.

This was an error made by Warner Brothers and they have not fixed the problem (bringing into question whether this is false advertising on their part).  So if your looking to buy the movie and want it compatible with your widescreen tv then DO NOT buy the cheaper single disc version of the movie..you have to buy the more expensive two disc special edition.	5.0	Not widescreen compatible	2006-04-08	6	5	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	AE5K0FI90BFQC	Juan Gorchata	This movie is a great ganster film with great stars like Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci. Speaking of Joe Pesci, I saw him once while I was walking in the streets of L.A. He was picking up some clothing from the cleaners when I decided to get his autograph. I was about to walk up to him when I realized I had no pen or paper for his signiture, so I ran a block to my car to get something for him to sign. When I got to my car I checked in the glove compartment for pen and paper. All I found was a pencil and a scrap piece of paper which already had writing on it. I was going to have him sign the back when I realized that this scrap piece of paper was a shopping list my grandmother gave me a week before. She specifically asked me to buy the things on her list for a birthday party she was giving my grandfather, which was that same day. I only had 5 hours to buy everything and give it to my grandmother so she could prepare it for the party. Most of the things were hard to find, so I was driving all around L.A. in a panic. On my way to a store I was flagged down by a group of cholos drinking in front of some house. I thought I was going to get jumped, but when I got closer I realized I knew them all. They were my homies back in juvie hall about four years back. It was good to see them all. Lefty, Angel, Joker, Paco, Gordo, Siesta, and Doc. It was like a reunion. They asked me to stay and drink with them but I told them I only had time for a few because of my dilema. My homies always backed me up, so they said they would take care of it for me. They told me to stay in the house and drink a few beers while they all go out and find the things that I need. I agreed and they all left. 15 minutes later I heard a knock at the door. When I opened the door it was an old cholo all covered with tatts.He called himself El Gato. He asked for Doc and gave me a bag to give to him. But before he would leave he wanted me to take a hit of the blow to show him that I wasnt 5-O. So I took a hit and passed out like a chump. When I hit the floor El Gato dropped the bag and took off. He probably thought I died or something. An hour later my homies came back and found me unconscious on the floor. Doc recognized who the bag belonged to and immediately took my homies to El Gato's cribb so they could do some damage. After they took care of El Gato they came to my aid but couldnt get me up. I was out like a light. They didn't know what to do so they called Maria, Paco's sister, thinking maybe she could do something. When she got there she kissed me on the lips and I slowly opened my eyes. She was the first thing I saw. She was talking to me but I was a little disoriented. Looking at her lips move I started to get my berrings back. When I finally understood what she was saying I heard her say, &quot; Aye Poppy, chu are de fairest one of all. Give me anudder kiss, babee!&quot; As I looked at her I saw a 5 foot 2 inch, 180 pound 38 year old cha cha. Not gonna happen. I got my grandmothers stuff and got the heck out of there, with my homies yelling and laughing telling me to comeback and visit again. Anyways, If you havent seen Goodfellas yet, rent it or buy it. It's a great gangster movie.	5.0	If you have not seen it yet, see it now.	2001-09-14	6	2	4

When I recently decided that it was time to begin building my DVD collection, there was no doubt in my mind that Goodfellas would hold a place of honor between ""The Godfather DVD Collection"" and ""The Sopranos""; a thought that was sound in theory, but premature in execution.This DVD release and its cheesy cardboard snap case could hardly hold a place on the [inexpensive]  shelf at your local video store.  The box said ""Soundtrack Remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1"", my ears said stereo.Half way through the movie I found myself looking at the interactive menu.  Puzzled, I popped out the DVD and looked for some defect that might have caused the DVD to return to the menu at this point.  Upon brief inspection, I discovered that the disk is TWO SIDED!  You watch half the movie, and then have to flip the darned thing over!A film of this caliber deserves a much better DVD release.  My recommendation:  Don't buy this DVD release!

0790729725	GoodFellas	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"In the 1970's director Francis Ford Coppola treated audiences with possibly the most accurate, yet somewhat romanticized, depiction of life in the mafia with his brilliant films ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather 2"". Ever since those two movies, no other movie has come close to touching the quality that is displayed in these two films for this genre, some have tried and come close (""The Godfather 3"" being chief among them), but none have succeeded. That is until director Martin Scorsese released his biopic on the life of mobster Henry Hill with ""Goodfellas"".""Goodfellas"" follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a small-time hood who happens to participate in a robbery with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), calm and calculating individual, and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), a psycho with an incredibly short fuse. Little did Henry know that this robbery would place him on the path to becoming a 'made man' in the very mafia family that Jimmy Conway eventually becomes head of. As Henry Hill rises through the ranks of 'La Cosa Nostra' he manages to find some peace and stability when he meets a young Italian woman (Lorraine Braco) that he marries and has a few kids with. However, the excesses of mafia life eventually begin to get the better of Henry, as he begins to unravel due to heavy drug use, and making matters worse his one-time friend and Don, Jimmy Conway believes Henry may be a threat to him and plots to 'whack' him. With his life in possible jeopardy, Henry has two choices, one stay true to the family and face possible execution, or two, become a government informant and be placed into Witness Protection, becoming a rat in the eyes of the 'family'.Director Martin Scorsese's work here is by far some of his best. His gritty, realistic approach to this true story, really shows the audience the great wealth and success (if you can call it that) that mafia life can have, while at the same time showing the pitfalls that can occur in that same life. The cast that Scorsese has managed to bring together for this film is truly excellent, and the performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta are so powerful, and at times scary, that you can really appreciate the great talent that these actors possess. The supporting cast is equally talented, and just as worthy of praise as the three leads. An interesting note is that for his role of the psychotic Tommy DeVito, Joe Pesci improvised some of the more extreme moments the character has, earning him great critical praise and somewhat typecasting him in this type of role. The story is an excellent cautionary tale on what can happen when your choices lead you on the wrong path, even though it's the only path you ever dreamed of. The movie is probably just as strong as ""The Godfather"", maybe even stronger due to it's even greater authenticity and lack of romanticizing life in the mafia. For those moviegoers that enjoy mafia themed movies, but have never seen this gangster classic, you must do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.""Goodfellas"" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/brief nudity."	5.0	An Outstanding Gangland Epic...	2007-05-18	1	1	0

Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracca and Robert Di Nero give exceptional performances. and really bring these characters to lifeI love Casino as well and while they are totally different films. The characters Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro play have the same quality. The scene in which Joe Pesci's character thinks he is going to be &#34;made&#34; but is not is an exceptional scene.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: In some ways this movie surpasses The Godfather in my opinion as the best mob movie ever. The reason why we don't see mob movies made anymore is because they've already been done perfectly. There's really nothing more to add to the genre. Goodfellas, like most classic mob films, explores the entire rise and fall of a man who is part of the mob. It's all about gaining power, money, and the will to do anything you want. It's about keeping your word, making the right investments, and looking out for your fellow goodfellas, wiseguys. The movie chronicles the true story of mobster Henry Hill from his rags to riches and back to rags story. That's really what makes this movie so interesting is that all of it is true. The acting is superb as well and Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance is incredible. The real main man behind this masterpiece is the main man behind the camera. Scorsese's approach to the film is just brilliant. He has the talent to be able to tell a story over a long period of time. This movie clocks in at about 2.5 hours, Gangs of New York and Casino are both 3hrs each. The movie flows so realistically yet you never get bored and it never drags. If you've ever wanted to know what corruption of the human soul is then this is the movie to show it to you.AUDIO: The DD 5.1 Mix is pretty decent, voice levels are pretty consistant. The movie features some classic songs of the eras that it chronicles and they sound pretty good.VIDEO: This is where we smile and say yipee! I own the first release of Goodfellas and let me tell you how happy I am to own this one. The first edition was one of the first DVD's on the market so the quality was pretty ""yuck"". With the first edition you had a non-anamorphic transfer, very poor video quality, and worst of all it was a flipper. That's right, half way through the movie you had to flip the disc to the other side to continue, and that was without any bonus materials. The new anamorphic transfer is just gorgeous except for one scene where I noticed a dark heavy line come across the screen during a scene with Robert De Niro. It looked very similar to the one I saw in Schindler's List.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: Bye-bye snapper case, hello Armary case. The two discs lay in the double Armary case with no insert with a very nice looking cover and back over. The extras are pretty weak for a second release if you ask me. The gold here would be the commentaries, especially the one with the actual Henry Hill. As for documentaries you have one about the Making of the film. Another with an all star line up of directors who comment on how the film influenced them, a look at real mob life, and a look at some hand drawn storyboards by Scorsese. Unfortunetly the interviews with the main cast and crew are all pre-release, which means that most of them are interviews made back in 1990. So I would say that's the only downfall. It would be interesting to see some present day interviews from the cast and crew. To top it off you have the Theatrical Trailer. Overall a major improvement from the first release.

I mean I knew that it was good, but I couldn't appreciate the brilliance in just one sitting. From the beginning of the movie, where our three protagonists, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are driving in a car making strange noises (don't ask what's in the trunk) to the ending where Henry Hill (Liotta) turns his friends in and leaves the life this movie never misses a step, it is almost as if he directed this movie frame by frame rather than scene by scene. Scorsese's camera work is also brilliant and he has the actors who can pull it off, especially Robert DeNiro. Music is also used masterfully through this movie; from the opening, where a we segue from 1970s to childhood of Goodfella to be Henry Hill in the 1950s to the tune of _From Rags to Riches_ to the frenetic denouement filmed to the tune of _Monkey Man_ by the Rolling Stones_ the music never misses a beat. When you think about some of the musical selections in the context of the scenes they are in it's strange, but despite that it never misses a beat. This movie is based on Nicholas Pileggi's book _Wiseguy_ which is also worth reading.	5.0	Don't ask what's in the trunk!	2000-12-13	3	2	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A14OC67MXL92FA	"Kindle Customer ""soul_survivor"""	"Goodfellas has long been one of my favorite movies.  I've watched it many times since I saw it in the theater.  I've seen it on tape, on laserdisc, on the original ""flipper"" DVD and the remastered anamorphic DVD, and now, Blu-Ray Disc.I'm happy to report that the Blu-Ray is a significant improvement over the remastered DVD.  The picture is brighter, the colors are more vivid, and many scenes have much more detail and clarity.  Of course, the overall picture is much sharper.Goodfellas is not the kind of movie that is a showcase for high-resolution video, however.  It has a lot of dark indoor scenes; very little takes place outdoors (something I never noticed before).  I noticed some graininess, which has a lot to do with how Scorcese shot the picture.  It's just more noticeable in the higher resolution.There are some minor problems with the audio in one scene.  The dialogue drops in volume and then jumps back up in the following scene.  Other than that, the audio is fine, although I would have liked a more aggressive surround mix, at least in the musical selections.  However, there's not much use of the surrounds here.Also, at one point there's a vertical line halfway across the screen.  Why this wasn't cleaned up is mystery to me; it lasts for about fifteen seconds.  Admittedly this is a very minor problem, but with expensive new technology flaws of this kind stand out more than they would on tape or standard DVD.If you're a fan of the movie and are considering upgrading to the Blu-Ray, I'd highly recommend it.  It's not an eye-popping effects movie to begin with, so this disc isn't the first one to reach for if you want to show off your system.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A356RFKNIG043B	K.

I actually think Liotta is better than DeNiro, who is tremendous. As are Pesci and Bracco. Everything feels authentic; these folks clearly grew up amongst real wiseguys and convey the atmosphere perfectly.What really lifts this flick above, however, is the perfect pacing and editing. The story moves tightly and quickly forward, with few wasted moments despite its length.It's also quite funny at times, though I always question whether making truly evil folks humorous (some of the real old-school wiseguys were not very funny) is a smart idea, but it's art, so each to his own.One thing for sure: the Sopranos pulled at least half their cast from this movie! Why mess with success?I disagree with Amazoon's own reviewer who calls this as good as the Godfather, though. As excellent as Goodfellas is, the first two Godfathers achieve a level of greatness and gravitas that few other movies ever have.Nonetheless, Goodfellas is a complete classic.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	"Of all of the ""mob"" movies that have graced the silver screen over the years, ""Goodfellas"" most certainly stands a head taller than the majority of them and it can be said that this film is one of the ""definitive"" mobster movies.  Few movies, if any, can compare to the compelling ""based on a true story"" nature of this film and the graphic realism that is so brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese's direction and the exceptional cast members.""Goodfellas"" is a powerful film based on the true life best seller ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi.  More specifically, it's based on the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liota), who along with his pals Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film.  Needless to say, the performances by these actors, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are nothing short of superb.The premise:Narrated by Henry Hill and his wife Karen Hill, ""Goodfellas"" tells the tale of how he grew up admiring the local mobsters, gained their friendship and then came to be employed by them.  After all, how could anybody resist a life in which if you're part of the ""organization,"" there is nothing that you cannot have and you have the fearful respect of everybody around you, as long as you're continuing to make money and not stepping on any of the important people's toes.As the movies progresses along, Director Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job in displaying many of the aspects of the mobster's lifestyle and the many things that can happen in that lifestyle.From the opening frame to the final credits, ""Goodfellas"" is a gripping, suspenseful and enlightening gangster movie that bears multiple viewings quite easily.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of gangster movies.  Fair warning though, this movie ""is not"" for the faint of heart or the squeamish, for it is fairly graphic at times, which serves to enhance the nature of this film but is not too good on the eyes.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:This DVD was released in 1997 as one of the early transfers, therefore it's not loaded down with an exceptional amount of special features, which is fine because it's all about the film.  I do find it surprising that this one hasn't been re-released as a ""Special Edition"" with all the special features, featurettes and documentaries.What is does have:- A remastered soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1- Production notes- Two theatrical trailers"	5.0	Goodfellas - A Scorsese classic!	2003-08-02	52	40	12

I first heard of 'Goodfellas' about a 4yeaes ago and I thought that it was just 'another' movie but when I first watched it I was hooked. I personally love gangster-mobster movies because all the members of the mob stick together and that's a quality that's hard to come by these days. They take care of their own business one way or another. This movie is probably the best mobster flick ever made also. Without a doubt, it's hard to capture the raw nature of an organized crime but with the help of Marty Scorsese, (also director of Meanstreets) he captured that quality and made a beautiful work of art. With the help of actors Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas has become my all time favorite and I recommend it to anybody but there are some scenes that may be to graphic so put the kids asleep before watching this great movie!Also Recommended: The Godfather 1&2	5.0	gets better in age	2006-02-18	3	1	2

Being based on a true story, you find your self amazed by the events that actually happened. ""Goodfellas"" possesses everything a good mob movie should...a great story, great dialogue, violence, and a bit of humor when needed. Some dialogue in the film is of course, not meant to be funny, but some of the things certain characters say in this film, just makes you laugh. Don't get me wrong, this is not at all a comedy, I just think it has some funny parts, Every good movie does. Phenomenal performances by Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci. The 3 leads just simply own this film. ""Goodfellas"" is also a violent film, not overly violent, but can get a bit graphic at times. Bottom line, I don't care if you don't like these types of movies, if you own a DVD player...buy ""Goodfellas"" 2 disc special edition.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1L43KWWR05PCS	Lawyeraau	"This is simply a great mob movie. Based upon the best selling book, ""Wiseguy"", by Nicholas Pileggi, it traces the rise and fall of ""gansta"" wannabe turned government informant, Henry Hill. Skillfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this film with its all star cast, megawatt performances, and period music soundtrack packs quite a wallop to the senses. Named 1990's best film by the Los Angeles, New York, and National Society of Film Critics, it garnered six Academy Award nominations and earned Joe Pesci an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.In the 1950s, a preteen Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) began his career as a ""gansta"" wannabe on the mean streets of East New York, where a small Italian American community thrived. Working with Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino's) crew, he worked his way up, doing the penny ante, gofer stuff, until he began more heavy duty involvement. As a young man, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) took to his life in the underworld like a fish takes to water. He married a nice, jewish girl whom he turned into a shrewish girl, as he lived the life he wanted. His wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), also became entranced by the perks available to a mobsterHenry teamed up with Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Together they stole, lied, cheated, and killed their way through life, until they got wacked or got caught. When Henry, against the express advice of Paul Cicero, got involved with Jimmy in the 1970s cocaine drug trade, it was the beginning of the end for him and Jimmy. The film skillfully chronicles the rise and fall of Henry Hill from wiseguy to goverment informant in the witness protection program..It is amazing that the actor playing young Henry Hill, Christopher Serrone, resembles Ray Liotta so much, right down to the piercing hazel eyes. He gives a terrific performance as young Henry, expressing all the joie de vivre that young Henry had over being associated with mobsters. Ray Liotta, as the adult Henry Hill, gives an outstanding performance. The viewer senses his absolute love for the life that he lives. He clearly enjoys all the perks of a mobster, his only regret being that he could never be a ""made"" guy, because he was not fully Italian, as his mother was Sicilian but his father was Irish.Robert DeNiro is wonderful as Jimmy Conway, low key yet powerful. Joe Pesci gives an over the top performance as the wild, volatile, and totally crazy Tommy DeVito, an out of control wiseguy who has no redeeming value as a human being. He is a guy who does not think twice about killing someone over something trivial. Paul Sorvino is excellent as the mob boss who is all about the family and plays it the old fashioned way. Lorraine Bracco gives the performance of her life as Karen Hill, a woman besotted by the life of a mobster's wife, until she realizes that girlfriends are an expected part of that life. She is sensational.This is simply a great mob movie. It is a film that the viewer will watch again and again. I, myself , have seen it at least three or four times, and each time is as if it were the first. Vastly entertaining, this film is a worthy addition to one's collection."	5.0	FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOODFELLA...	2002-03-04	11	8	3

A great soundtrack of oldies supplies the background for this tragic-comic tale of violence, sex and romance. From his early days as an errand boy at cab stand to his part in airport heists and cocaine trafficking, this story is told with humor and style. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino and Robert De Niro are great as are future Soprano regulars Michael Imperioli and Lorraine Bracco. This is a must for all fans of mob movies.

I read the editorial review on this website, where it says that this movie is every bit as good as The Godfather.  Baloney.  The Godfather, part 1, is far superior to Goodfellas.  You gotta be kidding.This is a well told story until the day of Henry Hill's capture.  Then suddenly the film goes way downhill.  The day of capture has time captions on the screen, and is terribly drawn out.  The movie is pretty bad from that moment on.  It is like two different movies - a very good one followed by a pretty bad one.Breaking his capture day into such long and stupid segments, chronicling what time it is, is just so way off base.  That day is important to Henry but it is not important to me.  And this is not the most interesting or important event in the movie.  It is to Henry but not to me.  I don't give a damn about Henry Hill or the fact that he was caught.  He cares, I don't.I would have expected better from such a well known director.  He blew it big time.The movie is too long.  The capture should have been shortened 90%.  Then the whole movie should have been wrapped up.  It would have been a much tighter film, and much more enjoyable.Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are terrific in this movie.	3.0	Very good until Henry's day of reckoning	2005-12-31	11	2	9

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"Interestingly, I rewatched Goodfellas, #94 on the AFI top 100, right after rewatching A Clockwork Orange, #46 on the AFI top 100. Both are about an enthusiasm for violence. Both tie music into what is going on with the plot. Watching them back to back, even accepting how ""groundbreaking"" A Clockwork Orange is with its alternate universe and its invented language, I still think Goodfellas should rank far higher than it. The acting, the plot, and the insight in Goodfellas is simply phenomenal.First, we start with the actors. In A Clockwork Orange there is Malcolm McDowell, and while he's good, I'm not sure one person alone can stand up to Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and the many other fantastic actors that are everywhere you turn in Goodfellas. Every single person is simply amazing. Even the ""bit parts"" like Michael Imperioli's ""Spider"" character get you interested. You are watching the very best of the best.And what they are playing is a real life story. This isn't an invention or fantasy. This really happened. These characters, their intrigues, their lies and deceptions and lust for violence, all of this was real. The men joking around with the mistress while the wife went to the family functions, the assumption that violence could happen at any time, this was the life they lived in.The music here is simply phenomenal. It sets you into the timeframe, and you can literally watch as the years unroll. It's not just the music, it's the hair styles, the cars, the decor of the rooms, everything. You can feel yourself reliving the decades and the feelings that they brought.The characters evolve over time. They rebel and feel angst and come to accept and then embrace what is happening around them.It's interesting because there's the same lust for violence here as in A Clockwork Orange. The characters enjoy pummeling another person. When Lorraine's character is roughed up by a neighborhood slick-guy, and Ray goes in to teach him a lesson, Ray *wants* to beat him up and put him in his place. When Joe feels disrespected in the bar, he wants to beat the guy into a bloody pulp, and he does. The violence is a normal, natural part of life.The women, unfortunately, hold the same be-used-and-often role in this movie as well. Women are there to be wives, kicking out kids and attending functions, or as mistresses, proving sex. In both cases they are supposed to be good natured, appreciate their part, and not attempt to change anything. A woman who complains at all about the small portion of life she's allowed can be beaten or worse.Still, I do at least give Goodfellas credit for giving part of the story through Lorraine's eyes. We see how hard it was for her, as the wife, to know there was a mistress around, that she ""lost"" her husband for days a week into that woman's arms, and that there was nothing she could do about it. She couldn't divorce, she couldn't complain. She just had to take it. The only other women she could ever talk with were other mob wives in the exact same situation. All the advice she got was ""at least he's not in jail"".However, in terms of the Bechdel test, it fails. The women rarely talk with each other, and when they do, it's about their men.A powerful look into a very real segment of society - and as much as it glamorizes how nice it was at times to be in a mob environment, it also shows the darker underside of it. While it might be fun while it lasted, it didn't necessarily last long.A great, powerful, well acted film. Well worth watching."	5.0	A Must-See, Powerful Acting	2012-02-16	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2UOZQMF8GIY17	Listen to ME	Everyone knows this movie is a classic. Absolutely true. What i want to get into is the Blu-Ray transfer. To sum it up in one word: grainy. It's obvious that the transfer was straight from the original film negative. You see all the lines and pops that would have been present on screen when the movie originally came out in theaters. I'm positive there will eventually be a remastered version coming out but who knows when that will happen. It definitely needs a good digital clean up. Audio quality is also lacking. It is just standard Dolby 5.1. They could've at least made it PCM. Really, if you get this at a good price, there is no reason NOT to buy it. The picture isn't bad. It's just not up to par with other Blu's out there. Still a great addition to add to the collection.	4.0	Goodfellas (Blu-Ray review)	2008-03-28	2	2	0

Two things to note, however, in response to claims that Martin Scorsese was trying to cheat people by releasing the film twice:1) Releasing a DVD is not the director's decision, it's the studio's. It's naive to believe he orchestrated releasing it twice.2) When the first DVD was released, technology was nowhere near what it is now. If you learn anything about DVDs you will realize that they are constantly finding ways to fit more and more material in less physical space, meaning you can fit a lot more movie and extras on a single disk than you used to be able to.Also, anyone who thinks Scorsese hurts the image of Italians has never seen MY VOYAGE TO ITALY, where he offers a true treat of clips from his favorite Italian films by the masters. The man loves movies, and makes great ones. I've never met anyone who thinks Italians are killers or thieves because of Mob movies.	5.0	Great film by a great director	2004-08-19	4	3	1

I was not really interested in seeing it until a friend mentioned ""it is a classic - a must see, even if it if violent and graphic - it is based on a true story.""After seeing it I realized this was the story the  popular TV Series, The Sopranos,  is based on. Mundane tasks of everyday life with family and friends are framed next to the violence of mob life.  The stark contrasting brings the mob in focus. It follows the life of Henry Hill; the movie is narrated by him throughout and later by both him and his wife Karen.The first line in the movie is ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.""  This is from a young pre-teen named Henry Hill in 1955.  He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn with an abusive father,  an overwhelmed mother and four siblings.  He did not care about being President, he worshiped gangsters and wanted to be one with every fiber of his being.  He saw shady transactions at a cab company across from his building.  He knew blackmail, kickback's, gambling was going on - this was his escape from boredom.  He wanted excitement and idolized the mob.  Somehow he got a part-time job parking their Cadillacs and waiting on them hand and foot.  He was paid well and made more money than the kids in his school, plus had ""respect.""Once the movie started, it engrossed as well as shocked.  The brutality and killing was ""part of the job"" .  Even though the mobsters acted tough and cool - you could feel the stress of the job was with them.  Scenes showing how the secrets were kept, how limits on communication, avoiding ""witnesses"", and the irrational ""blowups"" over nothing ended innocent people's lives.  It relieved their stress for a short period of time, but caused more stress hiding bodies.  Mobsters liked the excitement of what they did, but watched constantly over their shoulders for a snitch, as well as paid high fees for ""protection.""  The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were accurate.  Lorraine Brocco, who played Karen Hill was great.  (She looked so familiar - then I realized she also plays the psychiatrist on the TV Series of the Soparanos.)Martin Scorsese did a brilliant job with the directing and camera work.  The rock and roll music from the 60's was a good ""place setter of time.""  The script moved well and the characters were well developed, believable and real.  It was a great mob movie.  Ray Liotta was fantastic as well as Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro - all a ""cut above.""  I understand why this film was recommended as a ""must see"" -if you can stand the violence."	4.0	Violent Pre-Runner of Sopranos Series	2009-02-16	0	0	0

But, seriously, it is way overrated and hyped up for reasons I don't know. I bought this out of curiousity to see whether this movie was as good as they say it is. That just goes to show you how mainstream America can influence everything in what's considered ""great"" and how people come to view this stuff. Because it's some mob movie, and America is fascinated with the mob and organized crime, then any movie with mobs and gangsters in it will be considered ""cool"" and ""the greatest of all time"". I must admit that I do have a fascination with the mob, so I bought this movie to see what the ""life"" is all about. This is the third mafia movie that I am buying that is way overrated and just hyped up, which makes me realize how overrated these mafia films are in the first place. So, I write this to warn others not to fall into the trap. (I also bought this for entertainment purposes and just to say I how some dvds, really). First off, the narration in the film by Ray Liotta character killed it. The narration was unnecessary, not to mention the loud-mouthed, obnoxious, always showing off Tommy to make up for his height. It was interesting when he talked about how he got involved in the mob and his upbringing, but that was all to it. The violence and tempers flaring, ready to kill someone over a petty insult to spare reputation and ego was all needless. Movies like this and Scarface are only for those that love gangster films and can tolerate unnecessary and uncalled for violence, beatings, and killings."	2.0	Another Over-rated Mafia Movie!!	2005-04-30	19	4	15

Varnau ""nerff20"""	After &quot;The Godfather parts 1 and 2&quot; were released, it was hard to believe that Hollywood was ever going to produce a gangster movie that would even equal the quality of those two Hollywood gems. Enter director Martin Scorcese and actors Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. These four made a film that not only expanded on the qualities of the first two &quot;Godfathers,&quot; but also provided different characters and situations not seen in gangster movies of old. Needless to say, it was an instant classic. The four have gone on to become film legends (though DeNiro was already there) and the film is a cherished gem in Hollywood that is still not even 20 years old. Many people cite this film as Scorcese's best, although &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; was a bit more poignant. But no one denies that this is an excellent film with imagination, scope, and a take-no-prisoners attitude. One of the coolest films ever made.	5.0	A legendary film...	2002-12-09	1	1	0

I obviously would recommend this film to anybody whose into the Gangster action films and hasnt seen the movie. I love the fact its on Blu Ray now, The moment I saw it on the shelf i picked it up and bought it. the sound and picture quality is top notch and does wonders for this film regardless of its the graphics of the whole movie, the fight scenes that take place, the drug scenes or the shooting scenes all look great, crystal clear.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	GoodFellas immerses you in the strange, violent world of armed, ignorant thugs.  The Mafia depicted here clings to no pretenses of civility.  Everything is about money and power, and no one--not even &quot;made&quot; Mafiosi--are immune from a bullet to the back (or front or side) of the head for just about any reason.  Walk a little funny?  Get shot.  Talk back?  Get shot.  Bust someone's chops?  Get shot.  GoodFellas, in fact, spirals into a blood bath of gangster killing ganster for reasons ranging from revenge to keeping mouths shut permanently.The story is told from the perspective a young Irish-Italian boy who becomes an errand runner for thugs who hang out across the street from his blue collar home.  The money, power, and freedom of being above the law are too much for him to resist, and, soon, he becomes a young, murderous thug himself.  Ray Liota, who plays this central character (and provides splendid narration), follows this path to its natural conclusion--a cocaine-addled, unfaithful, narcisstic mob informant.  The transformation is spectacular to watch, particular in the scenes leading up to his final arrest, complete with overtones of paranoia, a mysterious helicopter that seems to be shadowing him, the creation of an elaborate meal, a remarkable scene between the drug-snorting Liota and his junkie mistress, and a cranky, crazy drug courier-baby sitter.A word of warning: GoodFellas is brutally violent.  People are dispatched, graphically, with guns, knives, and ice picks.  Frankly, the story wouldn't be as gut-wrenching or honest without the casual brutality of these animals in full display.  It makes the ease with which they kill all the more bizarre.	5.0	Cultural diversity?	2004-05-07	2	2	0

When you go to the movie theaters, all the movies are shown in the widescreen format. OK. When you get widescreen, you see 25% more to the left and right of the screen in the 1.85 widescreen format and 50% more with the 2.35 widescreen format. When you watch a widescreen film, you are not as close to the characters as you are with the fullscreen format. The only reason the black bars are there is because you zoom out everytime the black bars get bigger. The camera moves less in a widescreen film than it does when it's compressed to the fullscreen format. And, they do not cut off the top and bottom portions in the widescreen format.	5.0	The guy below me is WAY WRONG	2004-12-23	6	1	5

0790729725	GoodFellas	AM8DD7X3R9R8H	Marco Polo	Pauline Kael wrote: &quot;Martin Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; has a lift.&quot; Well,not for me it didn't. It's a well-made movie, tho the dialogue fallsflat at times: the colours, the lighting, the camera angles, it'sall very well done. Compare De Niro's &quot;Bronx Tale&quot; which all seems totake place in boring daylight or brightly lit interiors. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; openswith an atmospheric car interior. When the wiseguys get out and standaround the boot (from which the strange knocking sound is coming), theyare lit by the ominously blood-red rear lights of the car.But as for the characters, all I could think throughout this movie was&quot;they're stupid!&quot; As in &quot;Bronx Tale&quot;, the story is told (mostly) from onepoint of view - Henry Hill, who, as a kid who lives in the area of a mob, admires them, thengrows up to be one of them. We see what he sees of them, but not what he seesin them: without Henry's explanation, we would have no idea.As Pauline Kael wrote, we see all the characters from the outside only -I didn't get a sense of them from the inside at all. When a close friendis assassinated by the very mob he's in, De Niro's character goes nuts,but does it give him pause for thought? Does he question his loyalty?Apparently not: he goes berserk, then gets over it, and life goes onas before.Joe Pesci's character offhandedly kills a young boy who annoyed him.The cold-blooded murder seems to upset Henry Hill, but again it's onlymomentary and quickly forgotten. Did this and other sickening acts ofviolence (burying a body then having to dig it up again 6 months later,for instance) lead him to turn traitor in the end? The movie gives noclue.When Henry runs out of luck and money, and comes to boss Pauly forcash and forgiveness, he repents, and Pauly gives him something butthen turns his back forever. Because we don't know what is reallygoing on in Henry's mind, the tears of contrition sound and LOOK fake.Henry is incensed at the tiny amount of money Pauly gives him (a mere$3,200!), yet Pauly comes out of the scene with more moral integrityand generosity of spirit than Henry. This makes Henry's final betrayalseem an ignoble thing, and perhaps it's meant to.The early part of the movie describes the early part of Henry Hill'smembership in the clan, and it's all positive - the thrills, the money, the glamour, the girls, the power. The latter part is howall this unravels. Yet the movie's opening scene comes from the latterpart of the story, and therefore shows us the extremely violent side of beinga gangster right from the start. This doesn't make sense in terms ofnarrative, only in it's shock value: it's certainly a scene that grabsyou by the gut, and makes you terrified of Joe Pesci's character fromthen on in.For me, the glitter and excitement of a gangster's life is so clearly outweighed(in the movie) by the tawdriness, the violence, simply the consequences of a gangster'sactions that there was never a moment when I didn't think &quot;they're complete idiots!&quot;,and I think this is the movie's biggest detraction. Apparently Henry never thoughthis wife might not like him having a mistress (she doesn't) and might do somethingabout it (she does!). When Henry and Jimmy beat up a recalcitrant client, they neverthink his wife might not like it (she doesn't) and might go to the police (she does!).When Tommy murders a &quot;made man&quot;, all 3 realize he did a stupid thing, but pretty soonthey forget about it and assume everyone else does, too (they don't).I didn't come out feeling uplifted or exhilirated; I didn't come out feeling I'd learned something about human nature, that gangsters are human and have the same doubts and hopes as the rest of humanity; instead I came out feeling terribly superior: these guys have garlic for brains, they're complete morons! Watch out for Henry's wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco - a great performance). As the credits roll, we hear Sid Vicious doing his trashy send-up of Sinatra's famous &quot;My Way&quot;, and for me that says it all: these guys thought they were it, but their very arrogance was rubbish, not even the nobility of a tragic downfall.	2.0	Nothing good about these fellas	2001-09-10	17	7	10

First-rate acting from an incredible cast, a fine script, and some of Scorsese's most beautiful scenes (think of the freeze-frame of the exploding car, the long tracking shot into the Copa, the discovery of the dead bodies to the tune of &quot;Layla&quot;) make this not one of the best films of the decade but of all time. I must say, however, that I was tempted to give this four stars for the lack of any special features. Widescreen and a movie trailer or two just won't cut it for a film this good.

It's a mafia story told from the lower end of the system.

Also in the business are the smooth Jimmy Conway(De Niro) and the ruthless Tommy DeVito(Pesci) who go along with Henry on this lifelong journey through the mob.We get to see the highs of Henry like when he marries Karen(Bracco) and starts his family. To the lows of the late 1970's where he finally gets busted big for his involement in drugs.This movie is incredible. Like Coppola did with The Godfather Scorsese pays attention to all the details in this movie. The cast is absolutely flawless. The script is perfect. The sets are all real and authenic as are the costumes. This movie is just incredible.Ray Liotta gives the performance of his carear. He was a perfect cast for Henry Hill. He plays the tragic character to perfection from his happy high points to his cocaine filled sad points. Liotta not getting at least a nomination by the academy for this role is a shame.Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro are awesome in their supporting roles. Pesci won the Oscar for his role as Tommy Devito. He cracked me up in this movie playing the stero typical ultra violent wise guy. It really shows his depth and talent as an actor that he go do a character like Tommy and follow it up with a more family friendly charcter Harry in Home Alone.De Niro does his thing as Jimmy Conway. This guy is great with any charcter that he plays, but when he gets to be a violent mobster that just adds an exclamation point to it. I love his smooth talking and Jimmy is believable. Lorraine Bracco is also good as Karen and she did receive a best actress nomination for the role. All the performances are great in Goodfellas and props should go to everybody. This is one of the few movies that I've seen that has a perfect cast from the stars to extras.This is Martin Scorese's best movie. Like Coppola was born to do The Godfather and Spielberg was born to do Schindlers List this is Scorses's film. Nobody else could have pulled this off. The music the details it's all here. He should have gotten the Oscar for Best Director. Maybe he will finally get one for THe Aviator which is due later this year.You have to own Goodfellas. The DVD specials with documentaries are great. I loved the commentary from Scorese and Henry Hill. No serious DVD collection or movie collection is complete without this. Deep down inside like Hill I think we've all wanted to be gangsters at one point. I'll never be one, but I can experience the mob everytime I watch this. Go get Goodfellas now. You wont regret it.	5.0	Maybe the best movie ever made	2004-09-06	3	3	0

Ya had DeNiro and Pesci in their prime with Scorsese calling the shots.The scene going thru the restaurant kitchen where they didn't cut....best scene of all time.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3SM52MS1W29XQ	Matthew P. Harjo	I remember the first time I actually sat down and watched Goodfellas. I was hooked within the first two minutes.  Remember the scene when Henry 'roughs up' one of Karen's neighbors because he made a pass at her? I knew  from that moment on, that I always had a desire to be a gangster.  Not that  I'd ever be one (besides, I'm not Sicilian), but even during all of the  tough times they went through I remember thinking it just looked like they  had fun as they did whatever they wanted.By the end of the movie, you  feel as if you really understand them.  You feel as if you know why they  didn't ever go straight (even with each other) after getting 'pinched'.  You feel pity, as Henry Hill gives up his glorious lifestyle just to stay  alive. And you feel in a way, he might as well be dead.All of the cast  was perfect, especially Joe Pesci (who won the Academy Award for Best  Supporting Actor in this role).  The soundtrack fits so well, sometimes you  forget it's there--unlike newer films that drown out the sound with the  latest pop single.  The cinematography and directing is top notch (remember  the no-camera-cut scene of the restaurant walk-through?).You know how  you put on some music just to have some background noise while you do  something else?  Sometimes I catch myself trying to put this on for  background noise.  It never works.  I get to the cars blowing up and the  'Out of respect' line.  Then, I settle into my couch and get ready to watch  one of my favorite classic gangster movies.	5.0	How often does a movie actually speak to you?	2000-04-10	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2C7WAXG5OHTZ7	Matthew Rocca	Martin Scorsese is a director with a gift. He knows he has a great story to tell, and he tells it, in vivid and violent details. De Niro was great as a semi-calm gangster (calm compared to some of his other roles, for example, Max Cady from &quot;Cape Fear&quot; or Paul Viti from &quot;Analyze This&quot;). An even more important character to the film is Joe Pesci's psychopathic gangster. He is a perfect example of what happens when a madman has power. Ray Liota gave a great performance to Henry Hill. What I really liked about this movie was that it was unflinching honesty about the mafia. While &quot;Godfather&quot; was a classic, it glamorized the mafia, instead of showing the disturbing, violent consequences of the mafia. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; shows the mafia at its ups and downs. There are moments when you get that class-Italian feeling, and other moments that make you want to scream in horror. The acting was exceptional (but Liota's wife in this movie annoyed me a bit), the camera angles were good, and the honesty to the story was the best part. An original mob movie directed by a brilliant director. The DVD features are not especially good, but I read they're going to re-release this on a better DVD sometime soon. Scorsese has been robbed of the Oscars WAY too many times. This movie, however, is not for everybody.	4.0	&quot;You think I'm funny?&quot;	2003-10-31	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3ENN25NFADE1X	MBrian	"This is the best mob film ever. Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances. Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as he does in every other Scorsese film. New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about. In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas? ""I say Yes."" There are three reason's why I think this is true. 1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end. 2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with different stories.I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen. I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather. Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's. Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person.Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way."	5.0	"""Martin Scorses's Best Film"""	2004-08-31	3	2	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2454KRQPFDL6T	M. Clayton	This great film has been adequately lauded elsewhere.  The DVD, however, is terrible.  It is unecessarily and inexplicably 2-sided, which is very irritating.  The sound transfer is inconsistant, with dialogue getting lost in the background sound during several scenes.  And if you care about extras, there are none to speak of on this DVD.  A commentary from Scorsese would have been great, but there's nothing.  I love the film, but if I were recommending it to a friend, I would actually tell them to see the video instead of the DVD.	2.0	Great movie;  Terrible DVD	2000-10-18	5	3	2

There's black blotches throughout the film, and a black line that looks like a split screen effect in one scene!!

It just sucks you in and never lets go. If you ask me this film got cheated out of winning best picture from Dances with Wolves which doesn't even come close to this movie.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AMG2LF8MLUDN1	M. Fields	"There are many gangster films that rank high ratings but this one may just top them all.  We all love to see films about the bad guys and even root for them at times (what's up with that anyway?).  Martin Scorsese gives us an insider's peek at the way gangster life is.  It's full of realisms that you may not find in other crime dramas.  While this film is full of violence, it does not glorify violence but shows you what happens to those who lilve that life.  Live by the sword, die by the sword.Goodfellas could have been named The Rise and Fall of Henry Hill.  This film is based on his recollections of his former life.  You actually get to see Hill and hear him speak of those days in the special feature section of this dvd.  He does not look at all the gangster we see portrayed but looks are deceiving are they not?Paul Sorvino is positivley deadly in his role here even though you never see him lift a finger to anyone.  He states that he wasn't comfortable with the role because he wasn't sure how to portray a killer the way he needed to portray him for this film.  The outward appearance was easy but the inside of the man was more difficult.  After having dinner one night he got up to check his face in the mirror and saw a look on his face that literally made him jump back from the mirror.  It was then that he found the look of a killer he was seeking.Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci are, as usual, brilliant.  Pesci's character is especially disturbing because he is violent and 100% grade A nuts!  His best seen is probably the one in the bar when he, Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) and others are laughing and telling stories and then suddenly the mood changes on a dime just because Hill tells him that he is funny.  ""What's so funny about me?  What the @#@#@# is so funny?  Do I amuse you?  Everyone is frozen with fear because they don't know what to expect from this lunatic.  It's a very intense, powerful scene.  Finally, Hill laughs because he realizes that it's a put on and then everyone laughs.  In the special feature section it is revealed that this very same incident really happened to Pesci and Scorsese added it to the film.Goodfellas contains first rate performances from the whole cast.It's a must see for those who love the genre.Parents please be advised that this is not a movie for children.  There is a lot of violence and foul language.  I advise a viewing age of at least 18."	5.0	Maybe the best gangster film of all time	2004-11-24	2	2	0

The celebration scene of a gangster's release from prison and next scene of the late night unexpected visit to Tommy's parents house she told Jimmy &#34; I'm so happy to see him.&#34;  and with both events Tommy was cordial in supposedly upbeat moments in his defining life.	5.0	I spent most of the time looking for connections with scenes than with characters.	2013-09-18	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ	Michael A. Coluccio	"The quintessential New York City mob film, in a class by itself, my only five-star review to date (and I'd give it more if I could).  Based on the book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, Martin Scorsese's brilliant masterpiece introduces us to Henry Hill, as enacted by Ray Liotta, a disarming, likeable sort who can never be initiated into the Mafia because he's only half Italian (his father is Irish).  Nevertheless, the ""boys"" who hang out at the neighborhood cabstand have taken a liking to the adolescent Henry and use him to run various errands.  As he grows older, Henry forms a close association with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and the violent, trigger-happy Tommy De Vito (played to the hilt by a terrifying Joe Pesci).  This film has the audience in its grip from the opening sequence and doesn't let go until it ends three hours later.  Frank Vincent has a brief but memorable role as the ill-fated Billy Batts, and all of the supporting characters come across quite credibly as well.  In my opinion, the only weak point in this film (if you can even call it that) was the casting of Paul Sorvino as the local mob boss.  I felt he brought very little to his role.  A much better choice (again, in my opinion) would have been someone like Robert Loggia.  De Niro's performance is flawless, as usual, and Pesci dominates every scene he's in (he won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor).  ""GoodFellas"" was released in the fall of 1990, nearly eighteen years ago, and, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a single gangster movie produced before or since which even begins to approach its cinematic perfection."	5.0	The Best Mob Movie Made - Ever!	2008-08-10	2	2	0

Just know that ""Goodfellas"" is one of my favorite Mafia movies.  Everything about the movie is superb, and it deserves 5 stars all the way.  So please, DO NOT THINK THAT THIS REVIEW IS ATTACKING THE MOVIE, because it's not.What this review IS attacking is this terrible DVD.  I didn't know I was buying a smaller version of a laserdisk.  Why does the movie have to be on two sides???  I don't get it.  Yeah, it might be a long movie, but they were able to fit ""Casino"" all on one side.  So what's up with that?There better be a special or collector's edition coming out soon, because this movie needs one bad.  Not just because it's a classic and a masterpiece, but because it needs to be on ONE side!  When I buy a DVD, I expect just that.Other than the movie being on both sides, the DVD really lacks in special features, the picture quality is so-so, and the sound could've been improved in some parts.Again, ""Goodfellas"" is a masterpiece in my mind, and it deserves 5 stars.  But the DVD is just awful.  In fact, calling the DVD ""awful"" is being too polite.Warner Bros.:  Come out with a special edition, for crying out-loud!!!If you love this movie, don't get the DVD.  Just get it on VHS and wait until a better version comes out.  TRUST ME on this one.  Unless they have updated the movie and placed it all on one side.

Well first, De Niro is one of the most important characters in the movie (along with joe, ray etc.). Its also alot more than just ""Cuss words and blood"", actually watch the movie instead of just the violence and language aspect of it, anyway, this movie is not intended for an audience of your age. The movie shows an accurate representation of the mafia in america during 1930 through to 1980(and beyond) as well as a damn good story. Each actor (and actress) give it their best and it shows. Watch this movie because it is the best mafia movie ever made, i liked it better than the godfather movies, but thats just my opinion.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"For as long as he could remember, Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster. So, when he was 12 years old, he started running errands for the neighborhood wiseguy and extortionist, ""Paulie"" Cicero (Paul Sorvino). By the time he was 21, Henry (Ray Liotta) had made a name and a good life for himself stealing and reselling cargo. Along with Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), Henry organized and executed heists big and small for their boss and protector, Paulie. He married a headstrong Jewish woman, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who at first reluctantly and then enthusiastically embraced the gangster life. Even a prison stint didn't slow Henry down. Wiseguys get their own kitchen and accommodations in the joint. But Henry's defiance of his boss' directive in dealing cocaine and Tommy's violent outbursts threaten to destroy the world the wiseguys have made for themselves. Even $6 million from the great Lufthansa heist, the largest cash heist in American history, may not be enough to protect this group of aging gangsters from their own mistakes.""Goodfellas"" is based on ""Wiseguy"", Nicholas Pileggi's biographical novel about the life of mobster-turned-state's witness Henry Hill, who lived nearly 30 years as a small-time New York wiseguy before being arrested and entering the witness protection program in 1980. Martin Scorsese directed the film with a mind not to glamorize the gangster life, but to accurately portray the world of minor mafioso, a world driven not by violence -the violence is incidental, but by money. Scorsese succeeds in getting the audience inside of this world. Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as Jimmy, who starts out level-headed but is eventually unhinged by greed and paranoia. Joe Pesci is fantastic at conveying Tommy DeVito's unfortunate combination of easily bruised ego and itchy trigger finger. Lorraine Bracco is a convincing mafia wife, but her performance is at its most interesting when she first discovers how truly bizarre the domestic lives of mob wives are. Paul Sorvino gives a nice supporting performance as the patriarch of this extended family. This brings me to the starring performance of Ray Liotta: Sometimes I felt that Liotta was appropriate for the role of Henry Hill, and other times I thought that his line delivery was wrong. So I have mixed feelings about Liotta's suitability for this role. But, overall, his performance is convincing enough.""Goodfellas"" is an entertaining look inside inside an iconic American subculture. The Italian/Sicilian mafia is a fringe culture which, for some reason, never ceases to fascinate the mainstream no matter how ugly or petty it gets. I admit to not understanding or sharing this fascination. Wiseguys are never smart or complicated men. They are simple, laughably predictable people who exist in a very straightforward environment of their own making. The most challenging aspect of making a gangster film based on a true story may be making the characters interesting. Martin Scorsese accomplishes this by using the camera to immerse the audience into the world of these wiseguys. They are interesting within their own circles, so they become interesting to us. ""Goodfellas"" displays some of Scorsese's most masterful and seductive work. It contains some great performances, and it gives us a window into the culture of organized crime. Gangster movies must have the highest rate of being true stories of any film genre.The DVD (This refers to the 1997 single disc release only.): This is a 2-sided DVD. The movie is on both sides of the disc, and you have to flip the disc in order to finish watching it. The transfer has problems. In one scene that I recall, there is a thin vertical black line through the picture. The only real bonus features are a few pages of production notes and the ability to subtitle the film in English, French, or Spanish. I wouldn't recommended this DVD to collectors.

How could you not respect a masterpiece of this calaber?Good Fellas is the story of Henry Hill, the most famous turncoat in Mafia history.  At the tender age of 13 as a smartass kid in New York, he becomes an errand boy for his local mob club, to climb the ladder to spend 30 years on the inside.  His jealousy is obvious, as he, like Jimmy ""The Gent"" cannot be officially made because they have Irish blood.  But he copes and learns to never rat on his friends and keep his mouth shut.  Henry becomes greedy, as he delves deeper into cocaine addiction, lying to and cheating the very people who taught him everything he knew.  When he has hit rock bottem and realizes that his colleges are going to turn him in, Henry turns state's evidence and turns them all in.  He would spend the next few years in the Witness Protection Program, but emerged after seven years to become a pseudo celebrity.  He even has his own website now.What appeals to us so much about a movie about the Mafia is that there is no struggle against good and evil, it's all evil.  None of these people (save for the police) are the ""good guys"", and none of them are really ""good fellas"".  They spend their lives skirting the law, contributing to America's drug problem, and profiting off of otherwise honest people.  And yet they live like kings.  Snap your fingers and you have everything: money, women, power, prestige, material things, etc.  And at the end, Henry says the worst part is having to live like an ordinary shnook.  He shows no remorse for what he's done.  But then again, if we had that kind of life, would we?"	5.0	As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster	2006-03-17	6	5	1

This movie is the true story of Liotta's character  getting into to the mob at a very young age and moving up the ranks.  ""GoodFellas"" goes through his life until the end were he gets his self into trouble with the law and latter on with the mob. Before it's over tons of wackings and a surprise ending or at least I think so! When Liotta try's to leave the mob and it doesn't work out as he planned. This movie has everything a good mob movie should have Killings, people ripping other people off, killing, cops, jail. Oh, and more killing!

I BECOME APPALLED WHEN I'M WRAPPED UP IN A HELLA GREAT MOVIE LIKE ""GOODFELLAS"" AND I'M INTERRUPTED BY HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD LIKE SOME 1980's LASER DISC. I AM SURE THAT A SERIOUS UPGRADE IS COMING SOON. NOW ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF... IT WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE IN 1990. GOODFELLAS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES... GREAT PERFORMANCES ARE ALWAYS FOUND IN A SCORSESE'S PICTURE, NO EXCEPTIONS HERE. ROBERT DE NIRO, JOE PESCI & RAY LIOTTA ARE THE LEADS AND THEY ARE ALL IN TOP FORM. THE SUPPORTING PERFORMANCES BY LORRIANE BRACCO & PAUL SORVINO ARE ALSO VERY CREDITABLE. SAYING THE LEAST ""GOODFELLAS"" IS THE BEST MOB MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, I SUPPOSE THIS DVD WILL DO FOR NOW. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF STARS BASED ON (HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD).

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R	Movie Fan	Another shocking mafia story that is based on true events, and is just another reason to not mess with the mafia! My brother kept saying, oh you gotta see goodfellas have you seen it, so I watched it, and was enjoying deniro and liotta, and up until one of the most nauseating scenes I had to shut it off for time out. (And believe me, I am NEVER phased when it comes to gruesome murder in movies.) But I did not expect it at all. It was when the goodfellas were all wacking each other, and they were sitting in the car with the fat guy who talked too much, and it's a frontal view and you first see the fat guy shaking in his seat and he was gurgling in pain and dying. I knew they were gonna kill him, but I just was not expecting something that brutal and sick. And it showed joe pesci pull an ice pick slowly out of the back of his head, (after digging it around in his brain) and all he said was I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SHUT UP. Suddenly, I felt dizzy, like I was going to faint. That never happened to me before. We all know the mafia is well known for their vicious and brutal murders, but why couldnt they just pop him in the head quickly with a silencer gun. It basically made pesci's character even more of an unremorseful, cold blooded killer, and it was not even a problem for him. I think why it was so disturbing is it is a true story. It's sickening that the mob is having drinks one minute as buddies they've known their whole lives, and then sticking knives in each other's heads the next. I'm wondering if anyone stomached that scene well or not. Or is it just me? It's just a bit too much. Blah!	5.0	True Story	2005-04-07	2	2	0

Plus these wiseguys are so empty as people, I get tired of watching them.  Ultimately, the characters in this movie are not that interesting and I see no redeeming value in any of them, and my main feeling is that at best these gangsters are social parasites.So, I guess the main value of this movie is a somewhat entertaining semi-documentary, but this only is worth 3 stars in my book.	3.0	&quot;You're a funny guy&quot;	2001-11-24	7	2	5

Plays a super role as a boy who from a young age is seduced by the criminal lifestyle, the flash cars, money, and gorgeous women. He soon makes a name for himself but gets sucked deeper and deeper into the world of organised crime. Henry (Liotta) aided by his friends, Jimmy (De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino) gets in over his head and has to decide what means more to him. Saving his own skin, or loyalty to the people who took care of him. A superb movie and a must have. Buy it. Enjoy!	5.0	'We called ourselves goodfellas'...	2005-10-10	1	1	0

Towey	Martin Scorsese has an eclectic collection of truly great movies under his belt including 'The Last Temptation of Christ', 'The Age of Innocence', 'Taxi Driver', 'Mean Streets', 'Casino' (this movies sort of sequel) and many more, but for me only two come close to being this films equal, 'Cape Fear' and 'Raging Bull'. 'Goodfellas' surpasses even these with the sheer truth of it. This was the film Ray Liotta was destined to make in my opinion. This wise-guy imparts his whole world for our delight and delectation, laughing at us as he does so. The entire cast are superb so I won't bother to name them individually...no point in that whatsoever. 'Goodfellas' is immensely funny, shocking, kinda' sexy and wonderfully suspenseful. I totally feel the fear Henry and Karen Hill are experiencing as they bow to the weight of the inevitable and sign themselves into the 'witness protection programme' at the end. I'm also extremely glad he, almost alone, by dint of a charmed life, is saved...though dammed to a prosaic life of hum-drum tedium like the rest of us that almost manages to wipe the smile off his face.

Surely Warners coud release a special edition of this movie and keep it all on one side.

In all fairness, what gangster movie could?The story in this movie is good(A true story), but it does start to drag a bit later on.The two things I did not like about the movie were the ending, and the fact that so many of the characters came off as being very dumb. (How did they stay in business so long?)People were getting &quot;whacked&quot; for the stupidest, childish reasons. I think it is because the story was told from my least favourite character's prospective. What was told was only his point of view. I could tell you more about why he is my least favourite character, but that might spoil the movie if you have not seen it.I must be getting old or just too spoiled and moved from the Godfather movies, but I just did not see what was so great about this movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie is surely a &quot;must see&quot; if you like Mob movies, but I don't think it's a &quot;classic&quot;.	4.0	I Must Be Getting Old.	2004-07-24	1	0	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A12WE3MP6QF04	"""nanabush"""	This movie has got to be one of Martin Scorsese's best.  It ranks right up there with &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Raging Bull&quot;.  I have always thought of Martin Scorsese as of the best directors we have today.  He always seems to a have a great attention to detail and always directs his actors/actresses into giving tour-de-force performances.  The film won both Best Picture and Best Director awards from the New York Film Critics as well as numerous Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Pesci) and Best Supporting Actress (Bracco).The entire cast is exceptional, including Joe Pesci in his Oscar-winning role.  I was very surprised that Ray Liotta never received an Oscar nomination for his performance.  I thought he turned in one the best performances of that year.  And Robert DeNiro.......what can I say except that he's Robert DeNiro, one of the finest actors working today.  He has such a great scene towards the end of the film where he just finds out that Joe Pesci's character has been killed.  He is devastated and in such pain that he tries to hold it all inside.  Watching him try not to cry in that scene is remarkable.  And Oscar-nominee Lorraine Bracco has many great moments in the film including angrily confronting her husband's mistress through an apartment lobby phone and holding a loaded gun to her husband's face over his infidelity.  The soundtrack is another wonderful aspect of the film.  Every single song was probably specifically chosen for a particular scene in the film.  One of the disappointing things about this DVD is that it's not packed with extra's such as documentaries, director's commentary, deleted scenes, etc.  It hardly has anything.  In the future I hope they produce a Special Collector's Edition.  If you haven't seen this film then you don't know what you're missing.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	"One of those rare cases where everything just seems to click, Goodfellas is one of a kind.  Nearly perfect in terms of casting, acting, directing, and so on, this is director Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Raging Bull) at his finest.  Revolving around the life of mobster turned rat Henry Hill (Ray Liotta, perfectly cast), we bear witness to his rise in the mafia.  His wife Karen (a pre-Sopranos Lorraine Bracco) is along for the ride as she discovers more and more of Henry's ""other family"" which both frightens and excites her.  Liotta and Bracco are excellent, and the rest of the cast including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning role are the stuff that film legends are made of.  Scorsese perfectly captured the time period, and his use of music in certain scenes could not be more dead on.  I still don't know if this is indeed the best mob movie ever (it's tough to top the Godfather), but if it isn't, it's pretty close.  Look for Samuel L. Jackson in a minor role, as well as pre-Sopranos stars Michael Imperrioli and Tony Sirico.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2ETWB58VSTXQY	"Nick Bobraton ""The Land of the Jeff"""	This movie pars with Mean Streets as the best gangster movie of all time. GoodFellas is more detailed while Mean Streets is more simplistic. The movie is basically the life of Henry Hill, a gangster who was in the mafia from 1955 to 1980. The movie shows you how gang life changed over the course of 2 and a half hours. At first, no one got killed unless it was absolutly necessary. Then, killings became a habit. Robert DeNiro is perfect as a nervous wreck of a man, and Joe Pesci is always crazy, but in this movie, he perfects the Italian stereotype. Ray Liotta is also exceptionally good, and the movie flows very nicely. THe music is AWESOME. Check out the part where DeNiro's in a bar smoking and Cream comes on. Best movie music ever.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3MXU9J4AN5X4G	nick king of films	Of all of the &quot;mob&quot; movies that have graced the silver screen over the years, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; most certainly stands a head taller than the majority of them and it can be said that this film is one of the &quot;definitive&quot; mobster movies. Few movies, if any, can compare to the compelling &quot;based on a true story&quot; nature of this film and the graphic realism that is so brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese's direction and the exceptional cast members.&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a powerful film based on the true life best seller &quot;Wiseguy&quot; by Nicholas Pileggi. More specifically, it's based on the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liota), who along with his pals Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film. Needless to say, the performances by these actors, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are nothing short of superb.The premise:Narrated by Henry Hill and his wife Karen Hill, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; tells the tale of how he grew up admiring the local mobsters, gained their friendship and then came to be employed by them. After all, how could anybody resist a life in which if you're part of the &quot;organization,&quot; there is nothing that you cannot have and you have the fearful respect of everybody around you, as long as you're continuing to make money and not stepping on any of the important people's toes.As the movies progresses along, Director Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job in displaying many of the aspects of the mobster's lifestyle and the many things that can happen in that lifestyle.From the opening frame to the final credits, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a gripping, suspenseful and enlightening gangster movie that bears multiple viewings quite easily. I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of gangster movies. Fair warning though, this movie &quot;is not&quot; for the faint of heart or the squeamish, for it is fairly graphic at times, which serves to enhance the nature of this film but is not too good on the eyes. {ssintrepid}Special Features:This DVD was released in 1997 as one of the early transfers, therefore it's not loaded down with an exceptional amount of special features, which is fine because it's all about the film. I do find it surprising that this one hasn't been re-released as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; with all the special features, featurettes and documentaries.What is does have:- A remastered soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1- Production notes- Two theatrical trailers	5.0	definitly one of the best i would know i have them all	2004-04-21	4	3	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"""Goodfellas,"" #94 on AFI's list of 100 greatest movies of all time, is widely regarded as the best mob movie ever made by critics and audiences alike. Written by Nicholas Pileggi and based on his book ""Wiseguy"", ""Goodfellas"" charts the meteoric rise and catastrophic crash and burn of tough guy, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Hill was a small time thug whose involvement with the mafia paved the way for the most daring narcotics ring ever established in the U.S. Hill's teaming with the very dapper, very savvy, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and the very foul-mouthed Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) is at once fortuitous and frustrating as Hill watches Conway and De Vito rise to great heights within organized crime while he remains the front runner of lowly accord. The trio's mob boss, Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) befriends Hill but the association is short lived after their latest heist goes horribly awry. Brutally violent and viscerally disarming, the first time viewing experience of ""Goodfellas"" is very much like riding a psychotic horse through a burning barn - particularly in the latter half when Hill's own drug addiction leads to a manic and paranoid existence.As for the quality of this newly minted DVD, there is a marginal improvement between this disc and the original flipper from Warner.  Flesh tones are overall accurate but there continues to be a reddish tint in certain scenes. A murky haze continues to be present during the early scenes.  Digital anomalies are completely absent for an overall smooth look that is appealing. Fine details, black levels and contrast levels are bang on. The image quality will surely NOT disappoint.The soundtrack to ""Goodfellas"" is a very finely wrought 5.1 presentation. Dialogue is perhaps a bit more front sounding than one would expect - though no less bold and ironically crystal clear. The effects and music tracks really pack a wallop.Extras include commentary tracks, plus a host of featurettes and a thorough documentary on the making of the film. Overall, this is a great edition to any home theater aficionado's library and it comes highly recommended."	5.0	GREAT TRANSFER FOR GOODFELLAS	2004-08-20	8	5	3

This one, though, shows the mob on a day-to-day basis, not the more exaulted position the Corleones enjoyed in the three Godfathers. To this end, it's grittier, tougher and on a whole other visceral level. You see the mob stuff juxtaposed with everyday BS that most of us have to deal with in one way or another. The acting is truly superb. Easily Pesce's finest moment, but unquestioned career highs for the majority of the other major players. The cinematography is brilliant (the Copacabana tracking shot from door to table, is an amazing piece of filmwork), the direction just right, the dialogue completely realistic. A must see, must own, many times. Not only did Goodfellas set the stage for several other key mob movies to come, but without it, there would never have been a  Tony Soprano.	5.0	After the Godfather,	2004-10-18	4	3	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A363QRXP83K8ZE	"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155"""	The film is really five stars, but the absolutely shoddy DVD has to take away.Goodfellas is rightly considered one of Scorsese's masterpieces, a moment where a great filmmaker got everything right.  It's based on the Nicholas Pileggi true crime book about Henry Hill, a low-level hood in the Lucchese crime family in the 60s and 70s.  Tracing his rise from fetcher for local mafiosi in his  50s Brooklyn neighborhood, the film tracks Henry to the end of the line: the Federal Witness Protection program.  Along the way Scorsese stages some great scenes, charting the dangerous, thrilling, and ultimately miserable life of a mob hustler.  Ray Liotta has a perfect sleaza factor working as Hill.  However, he is almost too nice to be convincing as the same guy in the source book.  The real Henry Hill comes off as a real lowlife in the book, a guy who deserves no sympathy.  Ironically, years after leaving the program Hill now runs a website, writes wiseguy-related books, and calls into Howard Stern, though he's still watching his back.The cast is Classic Mafia Cast.  Robert DeNiro plays the greedy and devious Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway, Joe Pesci plays Joe Pesci in an Oscar-winning role(!) that basically defined the Pesci persona for life, and Paul Sorvino plays a portly Mob captain who has an amazing scene where he emotes while frying up some tasty sausages, tears in his eyes, handing Henry a massive wad of cash.The film can't be recommended enough.  It was robbed at Oscar time, criminally losing to Dances With Wolves, but it doesn't matter.  This has sealed itself as one of the ultimate guy films of all time.Unfortunately, the DVD is absolutely appalling.  You actual have to flip the disc over in the middle of the film to finish it.  This is simply unacceptable.  I haven't seen another like it, I mean, why bother with the DVD format?  The film looks and sound just fine, it's great, but how about some extras?  This film was highly praised and will hold up for a long time, so how about something?Not sure if Scorsese can be bothered or has not been asked to do special edition discs of more of his films.  The Taxi Driver DVD is very nice, for instance.  Goodfellas has a trailer, whoopee, and again, it's two-sided.  Lame.Buy if you've never seen this, else if you have a widescreen VHS this DVD won't offer you a whole lot.	4.0	Gonna chop 'im up!	2004-03-02	0	0	0

It's one of my favorites, it's Scorsese's best film, and it's both fun and unsettling to watch. Ultimately, this movie is the world's ugliest love story. The characters are seduced by the allure of the mafia, but the film shows us just how ugly and brutal their lives really are. It's a far cry from the romantic portrayal of the mafia that you get in The Godfather. Scorsese does a magnificent job of balancing the characters' perspective with the viewers'; there's no moral relativism here, even though the movie is structured through Henry's and, to a lesser extent, his wife Karen's narration. That being said, the movie is violent and absolutely crammed with expletives (it ranks #12 on the list of films with the most frequent use the f-word), so if those are a deal-breaker for you then I'd pass on Goodfellas.

I seriously doubt that Hollywood will ever yield a better one.The story is one of the Mafia glitz and how they were, to a man, ruthless murderers that we love to glorify because they got to do all the stuff we couldn't afford to do, either financially or legally. Only the best for these guys. The setting is the 50s, 60s, and early 70s.The top character is played by Joe Pesci, who loves to shoot and stab any fool who gives him the slightest bit of verbal guff. He's a diminutive figure who is out to prove that a hunting knife and a .357 Magnum manifest all the equalizer he needs to become a ""Made Man"".So this pack of Mafia scoundrels steal from, hijack, rob, and assault all whom are unfortunate enough to enter the circle of their realm and this even includes a number of their own brotherhood when the FBI begins to turn up the heat, generating an insider snitch here and there. The old conflict about some mafia members not wanting to enter the dope business also raises the stakes.This is a violent and graphic film in terms of language, murder, and darn near everything else.... and I loved it all.

Norman ""Magic Paul"""	"In this 1990 true film adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's 'Wiseguys"", director Martin Scorsese takes us on a wild ride through Henry Hill's life mainly from Hill's point of view starting in the 1950's. Ray Liotta is excellent as Henry Hill, an aspiring young hustler starting out making good in his neighborhood fast lane gang and seemingly riding high with the infamous Lucchese crime family. Eventually Hill's and the ""family's"" ride ends in numerous deaths and prison sentences when Hill turn's into and FBI informant in 1980.Scorsese could not have picked a better cast in Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco as Karen, Henry's beleaguered wife. The cinematography is fantastic and the music practically makes the movie.It's a fascinating point of view look at what happens to hoodlums as a result of their own self destructive indulgence and arrogance and that there may be real truth to the saying that ""there is no such thing as a free lunch"".PWN"	4.0	Altogether a great film	2013-08-16	0	0	0

Others have covered this already, so I won't belabor the fact that the first side stops in the middle of the movie, never mind in the middle of a word, and you have to flip the disc to see the rest of the best gangster movie ever made (and I include the Godfather in that comment).  Unforgivable.Five stars + for the film.  Stellar performances throughout.  Although the great Robert De Niro is given top billing, it's really Ray Liotta who's the star, and I don't think he ever received the recognition he deserved for this terrific performance.  Joe Pesci earned a well deserved Oscar for his part, Paul Sorvino is quietly terrifying as the local boss, and Lorraine Bracco comes very close to stealing the whole bowl of spaghetti from all of them.  Keep an eye out for another Sopranos actor:  Michael Imperioli plays a young wiseguy wannabe.It's interesting to compare Scorsese's Goodfellas to his later and much inferior Casino.  Even with the same screenwriter and several of the same cast, Casino can't begin to match the energy and inventiveness of the earlier film.Let's hope somebody decides to give Goodfellas the kind of first class treatment it deserves.	5.0	Great film, awful DVD	2003-02-21	11	8	3
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2ZTB8EDDR8RGW	Penguin Egg	No-one can portray American gangsters quite as vividly and realistically as Scorsese. He shows us the appeal of their glamour; but doesn't flinch at their violence; which is brutal, bloody, very often pointlessness, and always totally amoral.The film follows the rise of a Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, through the criminal ranks - loan sharking, hijacking trucks, killing - until he ends up as a close and trusted associate of the `Goodfellas' - a term that gangsters use for themselves: it means someone who can be trusted. It all turns sour when he feels that they have let him down and he turns to drug-smuggling behind the backs of his bosses, an unforgivable crime in their eyes.The film is gripping. Scene after scene holds the eye. Despite the film's length, the pace never relents. Liotta and De Niro are excellent, but it is Joe Pesci who steals the film. Not since James Cagney in `Public Enemy No 1' has a portrayal of a completely amoral thug been so frightening. The sense of violence bubbling under the surface of Pesci is never far away, and when it does erupt, it is quick, horrifying, but predictable.The period of time that Goodfellas covers, 1950s to the 1980s, means that the story tends to lurch from decade to decade, creating an episodic narrative rather than the more continues flow of `Mean Streets'. However, this is a minor criticism. The film is still a classic study of the Italian-American underworld and a great piece of film-making.	4.0	The glamour and the brutality of the Mob	2002-05-14	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1QWG77KXFU4GI	Perrin Frch	This here is another one of Martin Scorsese's masterpieces. This was Scorsese's return to the crime genre after his long time absence from gritty street crime life. Goodfellas is one of the most influential crime films of all time. This film won the academy award for best supporting actor, which went to Joe Pesci who portrayed the psycho gangster Tommy De Vito, despite winning that award, the film should've also garnered the awards for best editing, supporting actress, best director and best picture, but lost out to Dances With Wolves (Scorsese loses out to another bunch of stupid give aways by the academy).This film stars Ray Liotta as the main character Henry Hill an Italian/Irish gangster, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, Joe Pesci as the notorious madman Tommy De Vito, Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill(Henry's gal), and Paul Sorvino as the big boss Paul Cicero. This film spans over three decades of life in the mafia. We first kickoff the film with Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy driving in the middle of the night when they start hearing strange thudding noises, they eventually pull over and decide to check what's in the trunk, they start getting ready and take out a gun and a knife, once the they open the boot(trunk), we see the first acts of violence of the movie thrown in our faces, the movie is then thrown to the 50's where Henry narrates his reason's why he's always wanted to be a gangster. The movie is narrated through Henry's voice and mind, this movie is basd on true events and he chronicles all the events that happened in the 50's, 60's, 70's and mid 80's. The film, quite simply, is about what life is like in the organised crime ring and does it perfectly. This film is considerd the most accurate orginised crime film ever.Well where can I start? This film is sheer brilliance, you can't possibly go wrong with this title, Scorsese at top flight.Alright, this has one of the best soundtracks around and is a typical Scorsese film when it comes to sounds. The entire film is like one big compilation album, most of the scenes aren't absent with music, I think it's absolutely wonderful, it's like heaven for your ears and let's not forget your eyes. The direction by Scorsese is wonderful, the camera angles, the acting, everything!But one of the best parts of this film is the cinematography, possibly my favourite shots of all time is the tracking shot which follows Henry and Karen going through the clubs back entrance through the kitchens, and passages etc. The acting here is very authentic, as usual De Niro does a great job as mobster Jimmy, Liotta is brilliant as one of the leading roles who goes through the bloody underworld gangsterism. Joe Pesci is the standout, not just because he won an oscar for this role, but he managed to play a brutal, violent madman that was Tommy De Vito, Joe Pesci later played a very similar and ruthless character in another Scorsese Picture called Casino.Overall this film is something you must watch, but you have to have a cast iron stomach to stand the violence and language, if you're very sensitive to those things then you should look elsewhere. Otherwise, if you're just cracking into the cinema thing, then this is one of the films you have to see and have in your collection. An essential film to Casino, Taxi Driver, The Godfathers, Heat, Fargo, Miller's Crossing and Scarface. Even if you don't have any crime films this is one to start with.The extra features are not the best ever, because this was released as some of the first dvds, it has two trailers and production notes. This is a double sided disc, so you have to flip the disc around once the first half is finished. The film: 5/5, the extras: 1/5.	5.0	Best Crime Movie You'll Ever See.	2006-07-28	7	5	2

Afterward, my friend and I looked at each other with a mutual surprised expression -- ""That was a great movie"" . Scorcese is an incredible storyteller and, 'Goodfellas', like 'The Sopranos', has received such critical acclaim b/c of the believability of the characters and the creative way it is presented.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Martin Scorcese has directed many cinematic masterpieces, with Goodfellas being the best in his storied career.  Based on true story of mobster turned snitch, Henry Hill, the movie moves from Henry's teenage years as a fledgling to his rise in ranks to his ultimate downfall.  Shot at a frenetic pace and mixing violence and a weird sense of humor, the film takes us on a roller coaster ride.  Ray Liotta play Henry and he narrates the film along with his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco.  Mr. Liotta plays Henry as guy whom simply loves the life he leads.  What could be better than being in the mob, the money, the women, the drugs, the respect.  He can't understand how anyone could work in a boring 9-5 job.  Ms. Bracco is annoyingly good as the nagging wife from a Jewish family who is thrown into the Italian culture.  Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito who is another hood.  Tommy is basically a psychotic killer and Mr. Pesci plays him with a manic humor.  Robert De Niro is Jimmy Burke, who as Henry says, just loves to steal.  He ends up becoming paranoid after committing the biggest heist in history.  Paul Sorvino is Paulie, the family's leader and he plays him with the attitude and walk of a man who is worthy of the immense respect he gets. No movie has ever incorporated music into scenes as well as Mr. Scorcese does here. Whether it's Donovan's &quot;Atlantis&quot; playing during the beating of a man or the piano coda from &quot;Layla&quot; played when bodies of people Jimmy had knocked off are found, the music truly sets the scene.  Again, as it did ten years prior, the Academy gave the best director award to an actor turned first-time director.  This time Kevin Coster won for the overbearing Dances With Wolves and Mr. Scorcese was deprived of an award he so richly deserved.	5.0	Scorcese's Masterpiece	2001-01-17	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1YI3M18GYAJJL	Prince Riley	This movie is definitely NOT one to watch if you are in any way put off by depictions of violence, use of profanity, or stereotypical images of Italian-Americans. That said, the acting is first rate and the characterizations, while departing quite a bit from the the book on which the movie is based, are very well drawn and believable. Ray Liotta, who plays the lead role, narrates during most of the film, which at time seems a bit excessive; and there are a few stop-frame scenes which I found did not add the dimension of 'realism' which the director (Martin Scorsese ) obviously intended them to bring to the story. This is a &#34;long&#34; film (over 2 hours) and it should be given the period of time it covers (1950s thru early 1980).Paul Sorvino plays a very believable and convincing role as a low level mob boss and his dialog couch should be credited for helping him pull off a well toned &#34;Brooklyn&#34; accept and intonation. Robert De Niro is one of my favorite actors with an incredible range of talent (check out his other films: The Score, Wag the Dog, Casino - also starring Joe Pesci, Limitless, Ronin). Joe Pesci turns in a very decent job as a malevolent, trigger-happy, wiseguy; but he can't get out of the shadow De Niro and Liotta cast across the film.I must admit upfront that I have had a thing for Lorraine Bracco and her role as Liotta's wife while good, is regrettably not as strong as it could have been (especially when you read the book this movie is based on).  Her narration during the movie is counterpointed to Liotta's but it does not truly reflect the conflict and turmoil her character demonstrates in her acting.Surprising to most, Samuel Jackson makes a cameo appearance in what I believe is one of hist first roles in a major motion picture.	4.0	Great Acting, Great Director	2013-07-30	0	0	0

At one point during the movie, a vertical line cuts through the picture. In another, the an echo distorts the sound and makes the dialog sound like it has been fed through a Speak and Spell. Granted, these flaws are superficial. They do not change the plot and are only present for a small fraction of the run time. However, when one is paying for the ""HD"" experience, they deserve a film that has been given some manner of care in the transfer process. The movie gets five stars.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3K3J0P4B0Z1NY	Rad Brad	"I don't get this film. There is no positive message whatsoever. Swearing, killing and stealing don't lead to a great life. I was sad to see Joe Pesce stoop to such a low in his career. He was soooooo great in Home Alone, but then he has this vulgar piece of doo-doo on his resume. The only part I liked was Jimmy ""Two Time"" when he says ""Get the papers, get the papers."" I laughed and laughed. I rewinded to that part at least 27 times. But then laughter turned to fear when I thought Joe Pesce's character was going to come through the screen and pop a cap in my noodle for laughing. Overall, the movie was poorly written and badly directed. It wasn't upbeat and postive nor was it colorful and fun like my all-time favorite movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.I wish these characters would follow the lead of Ozone (Shabba-Doo) and Turbo (Boogaloo Shrimp) in Electric Boogaloo (or Breakin' 1 for that matter). They came from the streets but they didn't have potty mouths. Instead they used their hip street slang to convey their message of hope. Furthermore, they didn't need to use killing and stealing to get out of the ghetto. They used their dancing....popping and locking and breaking. Plus, they welcomed all nationalities into their inner circle of friends, the only thing they asked for was that you were willing to dance. Ozone and Turbo helped the community by saving the kid's community center, they didn't undermine it like these low life mobsters. Maybe in the future Martin Scorsece will take a lead from Sam Firstenberg, the director of Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. Firstenberg knows how to direct, Scorsece should take some lessons and maybe one day he'll actually create a meaningful film that will be remembered for decades to come."	1.0	Cover your ears...this film is naughty.	2004-10-21	73	12	61

0790729725	GoodFellas	A39WM5BQ54J8XY	"Randy E. Aveille ""raveille"""	Although it's accepted as being in the same genre as The Godfather, Goodfellas is quite different in many respects. Despite the fact that both movies romantically glamorize the Italian Mafia, the Godfather presents a portrayal of the Mafia that represents an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like loyalty, honor, and solidarity. Even though there are elements of that in Goodfellas, Scorsese adds his own perspective that seems to present a new generation of Italian gangsters who are not quite as nostalgic about those old traditions. What they are very nostalgic about is getting richer and richer, and attaining those riches by any means necessary.Based on a true story told in best-seller book, Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi (who co-wrote the screenplay for the film), this movie shows the darker side of La Cosa Nostra. The book, as well as the film, chronicled thirty years in the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), Irish-Italian criminal from New York. Smitten with the wealth, influence and privileges of the men connected with Mafia, Henry is seduced by their lifestyle as thirteen year-old boy. Along the way, Henry meets Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy (Robert DeNiro), and soon the three of them become best friends and associates; stock-piling enormous wealth from their criminal schemes that would climax with one of the most spectacular robberies in American history.One of the many things that make this movie work is the cast itself. Full of great acting talents, these are memorable performances from everyone; especially DeNiro, Pesci, Liotta, Paul Sorvino (who plays Paulie Cicero), and even Lorraine Bracco (plays Henry's wife Karen). Their performances were so convincing that it was difficult to not see them as if they were really the characters portrayed in Goodfellas. In addition, I loved the character narration in the movie, which helps to bring the viewer a more in-depth and personal insight into each of the main characters.Overall, this highly influential movie broke new ground, raised the bar for this genre, and set the standard for many movies afterward. The story, the acting, the great dialog, the directing and attractive story-telling are several of the reasons that it remains one of my personal all-time favorites. Arguably Scorsese's best film, Goodfellas is one to add to your personal collection.	5.0	Scorsese's Best	2003-12-12	2	1	1

This is also from the maker of&quot;Casino&quot;, another great film by Scorcese.  But, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the better of the two.  Pesci roles in both films are very similar and he is funny and entertaining in both.  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of my favorites and I will recommened it to just about anyone who can understand it and like it as much as I did.	4.0	Goodfellas with Great Roles	2001-09-03	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AO6L5RJILSLDX	"R. Long ""Tessie's Boy"""	"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about ""Goodfellas""... it's one of the best movies ever. To hell with the AFI, this is arguably one of the top 10 American movies ever made! Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco: five top-notch talents operating on all 8 cylinders in this story about three decades of life in the mob.Now, you'd think that Warner Brothers would give this movie the most complete Warner DVD release that's ever existed. A fervent popular following, a high level of anticipation for a special edition, and the current booming state of the DVD industry should've made this a no-brainer slam dunk for Warner's marketing and home video departments. And so, after years of having to flip over the old disc, after years of almost crushing that flimsy snap case, after years of listening to that 5.1 surround that sounded suspiciously like 2-channel, should you get this new version?? The answer is a resounding...""maybe"".Arguably the biggest plus to this new edition of ""Goodfellas"" is the fact that the whole movie is contained on a single side of a dual-layered disc. The ""all-new digital transfer"", enhanced for 16:9, is only a marginal improvement over the original release (which was also listed as being ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"" on the package; it wasn't). Strangely enough, in the scene where Jimmy (De Niro) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino) go to convince Henry to go home to Karen, there is a very noticeable screen-split line on the film that sections De Niro's face in half. This isn't the transfer's problem, per se; it looks more like something off the film print. The strange thing is I don't remember this streak being present on the old version. Maybe it's only a minor peeve, but still, this is the kind of thing you'd expect a studio to clean up for a special edition.The English audio is the same old Dolby-Surround-masquerading-as-5.1 mix used in the old version. The package incorrectly lists Spanish as the alternate language; it's still French. Nothing more to say about that.The disc menus are static, and they all have this generic-sounding jazz score playing over them. Remember all the jazz in ""Goodfellas""? Yeah, me neither.Of course, the real reason most people are running out to get this new set is to see the special features. This DVD includes 2 commentaries: one with various cast & crew members, the other with Henry Hill & ex-FBI agent Ed McDonald (who plays himself at the end of the movie). Of the 2 commentaries, the track with real-life players Hill and McDonald is infinitely more interesting, even though Hill mumbles more than Keith Richards having an acid flashback.When I bought this set, I was looking forward to some feature-length Scorsese, Pesci, Liotta &/or Bracco commentary (I didn't dare to hope for Robert De Niro, I mean, be serious), with some funny stories or moviemaking info. Instead, what you get is a few new comments cobbled together with 10-15 year old sound bites from De Niro and Joe Pesci. Basically, the first 90 minutes of commentary is a total strokefest (""oh-this-guy-was-so-great"", ""oh-she-did-a-really-good-job"") with only Scorsese, author Nick Pileggi, Liotta, and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus saving it. It picks up towards the end, though, when Lorraine Bracco (who shoots down the ""screen-specific commentary"" illusion when she talks about having watched the movie on the morning she's being interviewed) and editor Thelma Schoonmaker drop some funny thoughts.As for the rest of the extras? There's really no need to have a second disc to contain them; the total running time of all the ""documentaries"", as Warner calls them (""featurettes"", I call 'em), along with the theatrical trailer is less than an hour. Plenty of room for these on the first disc, but then I guess Warner felt they needed another selling point with the whole 2-disc thing. To summarize the 1/2-hour making-of documentary: ""Martin Scorsese is a great director."" Remember those 6 words and everything else is cream cheese.The second major documentary, at around 13 minutes long, has interviews with some younger writer-directors who've found themselves influenced by ""Goodfellas"". Only 5 words to remember this time: ""'Goodfellas' is a brilliant movie.""The other two featurettes are about 10 minutes altogether. One is a storyboard-to-screen comparison, the other is a little throwaway piece with some cast & crew anecdotes. 4 words will do this one just fine: ""Warner Brothers is lazy.""It's really a shame that Warner Brothers couldn't wait just a tad longer and include some truly special features for one of the best movies their studio has ever produced. With the stellar jobs they've done on their other 2-disc reissues, like ""Enter the Dragon"", ""The Right Stuff"", ""Singin' in the Rain"" --jeez, even ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" has better features than this!!-- I expected Warner Bros. to really pull out all the stops for this new edition of ""Goodfellas"", but it's a big letdown. Still, it is an improvement (no matter how minor) over the previous release, and as it is probably the ""best"" version we're ever gonna get on DVD, I would have to recommend picking it up.However, if you already own the movie, keep three things in mind. Ask yourself 1.) if you really mind flipping the old disc over, 2.) if you've got a normal full-screen TV, do you really need a new anamorphic transfer?, and 3.) do you really need to see the special features if they're not exactly top quality? If your answer to any of these things is ""no"", then I'd think long and hard about shelling out another $20.**UPDATE - 12/31/2010** Having recently gotten a PS3, I've been going nuts updating as many of my DVDs as possible to Blu-Ray, but like most people who've made the switch, I've come to learn that it's not always worth it in every case. I just got the new 20th Anniversary Edition Goodfellas BluRay and I can confirm that it has the same exact lame special features we were issued on the so-called ""special"" edition DVD six years ago (with two ""new"" extras; more on that in a minute).The image upgrade is noticeable to me, but not impressive enough (that line is STILL running down De Niro's face) for me to recommend laying out yet another 20-odd dollars for the same product. C'mon, Warners, all this time and you still haven't learned your lesson? And being that this is Blu-Ray, maybe a TrueHD audio track would be in order? Nope, we get the same old 5.1. Thanks a pantload.So what's new on this 20th Anniversary release? Well, I'll admit it does have a snazzy hardbound book-shaped case, even if it doesn't have much in common with the film, design-wise. There's also a pretty nice booklet about 30 pages long with stills from the movie. There are also two additional features that weren't present on the original DVD: a documentary on the history of the '30s and '40s gangster movies and a selection of mob-themed Looney Tunes shorts. The problem is, this is recycled content; the cartoons can be found in the Looney Tunes sets, while the documentary is a leftover from a Warner Brothers gangster movie box set released a few years ago. They're both fun, both interesting, but have only the most tenuous connections with Goodfellas. Couldn't squeeze one substantial new extra out of this new release, could they? Once again, all people wanted was a little decent treatment given to one of the best movies ever produced by a major studio. Once again, Warner Brothers has proven they just don't get it. Fair enough, but this is the last copy of Goodfellas I buy. I don't care if they come out with the deluxe 25th Anniversary 3D Super-BluRay Scratch 'n Sniff Edition, I'm not biting.On a side note, I just want to say thanks to everybody for all the helpful votes and whatnot, glad you found this review useful over time.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"Goodfellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990)I hated Casino when I went to see it back in 1995. I now understand why; Casino was Scorsese's attempt to remake Goodfellas, but like Brian DePalma attempting to remake Curtis Hanson's L. A. Confidential in The Black Dahlia, the later film ended up somehow being both a shadow of the original and, if unintentionally, a parody of the original as well. Everything about Casino that ended up awful was fantastic in Goodfellas.Based on Nicholas Pileggi's autobiography, Goodfellas follows three guys--Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), and Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)--who all want to be mobsters. (Granted, as Tommy is the only Italian in the bunch, they don't have much of a chance.) From the outside, we're perfectly aware that they, and their band of assorted outlaws, are mostly comic relief for the actual made men in the area; they're well-meaning, but usually either not forward-looking enough when planning things, or simply inept. But they're exceptionally-drawn, all three of them perfectly-done pictures of what my in-laws are wont to call ""bags of neuroses"". We, as the viewers, are alternately amused and horrified by their doings. Meanwhile, when they're not out doing flunky jobs for the mob or trying to get ahead with side jobs of their own, their private lives are even more of a mess. It stands to reason that even the most thick-headed flunky will eventually get tired of riding on someone else's coattails and find some way to push the envelope. When it happens, it's pure screen magic. Then comes the denouement, and Scorsese proves himself a master of pace--the denouement is longer than the buildup, and if anything, even more compelling, as the three of them take different directions towards either redemption or self-destruction.Simply put, an amazing piece of moviemaking.

While it makes much of the violence seem funny and natural, the overall impact of the film is to show how empty and dangerous the mob life really was.  I have watched this at least 15 times, and have enjoyed it every single time as more detail comes through.  The characters are extremely subtle and the acting is absolutely first rate.  You get a historical snapshop of organizaed crime as well as a cautionary tale:  the dreamlike quality of ""the life"" gives way to the ugliest of realities.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"This film is based on a book written by Nicholas Pileggi (Wiseguy) as was Casino based on another of his books (Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas). Both were directed by Scorcese and two of the major characters in both films are portrayed by DeNiro (""Ace"" Rothstein and Jimmy Conway) and Joe Pesci (Nicky Santoro and Tommy DeVito). For me, these are the only significant similarities between the two film classics. True, Scorcese effectively employs a number of documentary techniques in both (especially during the first half of Casino) but the setting of GoodFellas is essentially a neighborhood whereas Casino examines the gambling culture of Las Vegas, represented by the Tangiers which is owned by syndicate bosses headquartered elsewhere. Moreover, the character Henry Hill (portrayed as an adult by Ray Liotta) is used as a device by which to explain rites of passage into the local crime world whereas the focal point of Casino is Rothstein as he becomes (in effect) the COO of a major casino and quickly establishes total local control of its operations, then (for various reasons) makes personal decisions which eventually place him and his absentee bosses in harm's way. One of the several reasons I admire Scorcese so much is his talent (indeed genius) for creating so-called ""minor"" but nonetheless memorable, indeed unforgettable characters. For example, Paul Cicero (portrayed by Paul Sorvino) in this film, a character which may have had some influence on the creation of another character, Tony Soprano. Cicero embodies menace precisely because his personality is so understated. His selective use of a paternalistic posture (reminiscent of Johnny Friendly's, a less-subtle character played by Lee J. Cobb in On the Waterfront) belies his absolute determination to sustain absolute control over his crime operations. Comparisons and contrasts of this film with Casino are probably inevitable. I think both are classics but for different reasons. The former is anchored in local experience, somewhat ""small-time"" crime if you will, whereas the latter examines the culture of an entire industry in which the scale and impact of crime are far greater. (The same point could be made about Godfather I and Godfather II, although I much prefer to view them in a chronological sequence.) Even in Casino, however, Scorcese constantly locks in on two or three characters in a specific situation. He is at his best when dramatizing the dynamics of verbal and physical violence in small scale (e.g. Raging Bull and The Gangs of New York). In my opinion, like Tolstoy, Scorcese's vision may be ""epic"" in certain films but the impact of his art is best measured in quite human terms...scene by scene, juxtaposing statement and response, action and reaction."	5.0	Fabric, Texture, and Nuance of Cinematic Genius	2003-06-24	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2D8IKZXCY9GAY	"Robin Hood ""Sherwood Forest"""	"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Based on the real life story of Henry Hill, Goodfellas depicts two Irish-Italian Americans, Henry Hill (Liota) and Jimmy Conway (De Niro), and their full-blooded Italian friend Tommy DeVito (Peschi) rise in the mafia. Goodfellas progresses into the day-to-day life of three members of the Mafia as they try to rise up the ranks. The story revolves around Henry and his personal struggles from petty crime, to hired killer, to drug dealer.Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Casino, Cape Fear, Raging Bull) delivers in Goodfellas, perhaps his best movie. Scorsese does a wonderful job of allowing the music to set the mood. As the viewer, you may not notice it, but Scorsese's music sets the tone for the rise and fall of the emotion throughout his films. Scorsese depicts very dark images well. The viewer feels the villain in each character. There is no good guy in Goodfellas and Scorsese makes you feel it.Scorsese adds little pieces to the movie that are not necessary, but really add to the film. Some examples of these occurrences are when Hill gets beat by his Dad for not attending school. The local mob drives around, finds the postman, then roughs him up for delivering mail from the school to Hill's house. Another prime example occurs with the guy who continues to irritate De Niro with the line, ""I want my money."" This guy is a smuck, all movie you are waiting for him to get whacked, you just know it is coming. Then, you think he might make it, nope.Joe Pesci, and his little man complex are wonderful once again. Lethal Weapon 2 was his launching point in my opinion. However, Goodfellas depicted him as the little guy with the big attitude you did not want to mess with. This little man complex he developed and depicted to perfection in Goodfellas definitely helped him later grab the roles in Casino, Home Alone 1 & 2, My Cousin Vinny, and A Bronx Tale. Pesci really had a coming out party in Goodfellas, and it was wonderful to watch unfold.Samuel L. Jackson even had his bit part. The poor guy did not last very long, too bad, because he just made it big. Then he got his for not doing what De Niro told him.Overall Goodfellas is a must have in your DVD collection, one of the great mob movies of all time. I know a lot of people on Amazon want to place it ahead of Scarface...but I cannot. Scarface is brilliant from beginning to end, while Hill punks out at the end. If Hill went out like a man, similar to Scarface, the two films would be tied. Unfortunately, Hill turned into a waste of life, as Tony Montana was on his way to becoming. I must say for that reason alone, Goodfellas is the second greatest Mob movie of all time.Grade: A(...)"	5.0	Never Rat On Your Friends And Keep Your Mouth Shut	2005-04-23	1	0	1

The pure jolt of energy that leaps off the screen--big or small--is powerful enough to make even the most ardent 18th century Anthony Hopkins period-drama fan become infused with a zeal for profanity, violence, and pure movement. The epic sweep in ""Goodfellas"" rivals that of any more ""respectable"" drama you could think up.And the cast, what more is there to say? Liotta, with the face of an angel and the mind of a devil.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	This film is quite frankly a masterpiece of storytelling, and it does an excellent job of explaining how it might be to be on the inside of organized crime.  This is the story of petty gangster Henry Hill, and is based on his actual, true-to-life autobiography.  As Hill explains in the movie &quot;I always wanted to be a gangster.  To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States...&quot;  Now that's ambition!Hill and his fellow gangsters (known among themselves as &quot;wise guys&quot; or &quot;good fellas&quot;) look down at working men and women as schmucks.  Why should anyone slave away and work for a living in a real job when you can make ten times more money (or a hundred times more!) stealing and playing the rackets?  Hill couldn't see one single reason to engage in legitimate work for just this reason.  For a time, for Hill crime paid and paid big.  This film chronicles gangster Hill's initial ascent into the prosperity of being a successful gangster, and his eventual descent into drug dealing, wanton murder and horrific violence, and in the end, poverty, jail, and betrayal.The film is great entertainment, although it has sufficient really bad violence such that this is no movie for young children or even teens under maybe 16 years old.  The violence is pretty graphic, but it is not gratuitous and I will say that it is a necessary part of the story because it shows the terrible price that these gangsters paid in order to keep the easy money rolling in.Ray Liotta is very good in this film as Henry Hill.  Robert De Niro turns in his customary subperb performance as Jimmy &quot;the Gent&quot; Conway.  Joe Pesci is effective as the rabid mobster Tommy DeVito, and Pesci's excellent performance in this film is what really caused his career to ignite. The rest of the supporting cast does extremely well also, making this film one of the really great gangster flicks.  While The Godfather in a sense glorifies organized crime as a modern day Roman Empire (as Tom Hagan refers to it in Godfather II), this film shows the mob's dirty, gritty underbelly of pointless violence, cruelty, and corruption.The film never fails to hold the viewer's interest and entertain.  It is not for young children, however.	5.0	A masterpiece!  A wonderful look at petty organized crime!	2004-01-03	1	1	0

But it is impossible to deny it has flaws(e-mail me if you wanna have examples), which Goodfellas has none.  This was my favorite film of all time until I saw &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and still remains un-chalanged in my number two slot. Scorsese uses his trademark scrolling and fast-paced movement to deliver an intensity that is delivered by none other. With an incredible cast of Ray Liota(who proves in this and Copland that he is the most under-rated actor today), Joe Pesci, and the always incredible godlike Robert DeNiro the already powerful script is risen to levels that astound and bewilder. The few complaints I've ever even heard of this film were simply of its violence, which if you've seen this know is completely necessary. Note:Just because you like this don't think you'll like Casino, it proves team-ups don't always bring repeat success.	5.0	Goodfellas the greatest mafia movie ever!	2000-10-23	0	0	0

The best scene in almost any movie,  maybe having Joe Pesci saying it makes it that much better.Goodfellas, as many would say, the best mob movie around.  I will have to agree, that is a damn fine movie.The story of a guy growing up in a town where the mob are the cool cats in town.  Everyone shows them respect ('cause they're scared probably), people know not to mess with them.  An easy income at that, too.  Well, almost easy.This guy, played by Ray Liotta, comes up through the ranks to make it big.  Early on he gets arrested, but the smart kid that he is, he doesn't rat out his friends.  When he's released, he gets back into that world, some showing him respect for showing his true colors at his trial (not rating the families out).  It is here that we meet Joe Pesci's character Tommy.One of my favorite characters from the Sopranos (Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher in that show) plays a famous role in Goodfellas.  That of a guy who Pesci picks on, a fool in his opinion.The movie takes a turn for the worse about halfway through.  As cocaine becomes a major issue in the film.  Ray Liotta's character becomes addicted, as well as his wife (played by Lorraine Bracco, also of Sopranos fame) and his mistress.  Things start going downhill for the others in the film at this point too, the first half of the movie is the best.A film that will always be a classic in many people's minds.  Directed by Martin Scorsese, who put Joe Pesci in his 1995 film (Casino) in a simular role to this one. DeNiro has been in many of Scorsese's pictures too:  Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, and Casino to name a few."	5.0	A Classic	2004-09-13	6	1	5

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3GSRV2ZJYJCYK	"Sam Watermeier ""sammovieman"""	"GoodfellasMovie Grade: A""Goodfellas"", director Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, based on the book, Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi,the co-writer, explores the criminal life like no other film. It is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a half-Irish, half-Italian gangster who had been working for the mob since he was a teenager. As he grows older, he becomes part of a group, with his partners and friends, Jimmy ""the Gent"" Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci). This group is kept under close surveillance by crime boss, Paulie (Paul Sorvino).With a runtime of over two hours, ""Goodfellas"" is an epic film. It is an unforgettable journey, spanning three decades of life in the mafia. Music from the outstanding soundtrack is brilliantly used for transition throughout the film. Over the course, we are also introduced to several compelling characters.These characters, especially Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy, are depicted with enormous complexity, whereas in a lesser film they would be simple caricatures of themselves. Scorsese and Pileggi truly understand these men and really humanize their characters. This is also due to the film's stellar cast.  Ray Liotta, with his expressions, pauses, and forced laughter conveys in his character deep guilt for the consequences of the life he leads. He supresses his own emotions when he experiences acts of violence or when women question what exactly he does for a living. De Niro is also great as Jimmy. He has an avuncular way about him and although he is not in much of the film, he has a strong presence.Even more extreme characters like Tommy (Joe Pesci) are given depth. He is not portrayed as simply a gun crazy madman, but as a man who feels a constant need to demonstrate his power, using violence to rid himself of his insecurity. His insecurity is introduced subtly in an early scene.In the famous restaurant scene, after telling a story, Tommy asks Henry what he meant when he said he was ""funny"". Even though he is kidding with him we can tell that deep down he is truly angry with Henry. This is one of the most interesting and intense scenes in the film. It is a very original way of introducing Tommy and Pesci is brilliant. His sudden transitions of behavior make for a truly amazing performance. There is always a sense of menace about him, like he is about to snap any second. Throughout the film he goes to even further lengths to prove himself, like when a bartender stands up to his insults and he murders him or when a mob boss makes fun of him for his previous job as a shoeshiner and he beats him to death.Violence like this comes naturally in the film. The interesting angle of this is that is not a straight forward morality tale, but about the appeal of the criminal life and the lengths people are willing to go, the emotions they suppress, and the repressed memories they will experience to gain power and wealth.Now, back to Henry. When Henry feels comfortable with his place in his criminal career, he settles down and gets married to Karen (Lorraine Bracco), a Jewish girl from Brooklyn. She knows that Henry has secrets, but even she is seduced by the rewards involved in living the criminal life. She gladly takes sweaty wads of cash from him to go shopping even though she knows the money is dirty.The relationship between Henry and Karen is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. Part of the film is a cautionary tale about the affect of living two lives. Henry has to trust Karen and Karen has to trust him. This is the only thing that keeps their relationship together, not to mention their enormous wealth.One of the most brilliant scenes in the movie is one which consists of a day in the life of Henry Hill as he tries to do a cocaine deal, cook dinner for his family, pick up his brother from the hospital, all while he is being followed by a helicopter. This scene like many others shows what the film is really about: risk versus reward and the consequences of the life you choose.Having said that, what holds the story together is the tragedy of Henry Hill. He is a genuinely good guy  who cares for others around him, but his double life is an addction. Even though, in the mob life, he experiences acts of violence and tries to repress them, thus causing more deaths, he can't give it up."	5.0	Explores the criminal life like no other film: A masterpiece	2006-06-13	5	4	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2P048O94H68TX	SandyHanitizer	"I'm ready to rant about what must be the worst DVD transfer in history. Sadly that horrible transfer is also one of the best movies, Goodfellas. It is so sad that in 2013, I am writing a review about a terrible DVD transfer that people were already complaining about in 2001, in the very early days of DVD.So, what is it about the version of Goodfellas I recently purchased that makes it suck such legendary ass? Well gather around children and let me tell you.1.) ""Widescreen Edition"" - ""Presented in a matted widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS"".- This is absolutely completely misleading BS. The name of the actual title encoded on the disc is GOODFELLAS_4X3LB_NA . That doesn't sound like a widescreen presentation to me -- no, in fact, it is not a widescreen presentation. It is a 4x3 aspect ratio version cropped heavily on the top and bottom, and on the right and left. All told, I expect only about 2/5 of the screen is used for displaying the movie -- it is just a tiny rectangle in a sea of black borders at 16x9. It is REALLY terrible.2.) I imagine a Warner Brothers DVD Production meeting: ""Let's have the viewer flip that disc over half way. Preserve that 2 VHS tape presentation that they loved so much in the 1980's!"". This is also inexcusable that such a version of the movie persists on store shelves to this day. Literally at 1 hour and 12 minutes. Yes, 1 hour and 12 minutes into the disc, you have to get up, go over to the DVD player and flip the disc over so you can watch the other 1 hour and 12 minutes. This also means if you copy your DVDs to your home network you'll have to load up another file half way through as well. Long-ass Michael Mann movies originally on 2 VHS tapes like Last of the Mohicans and Heat which released in the early days of DVD alongside Goodfellas and were on a single side disc (in a proper widescreen format to boot) even then.3.) Considering the two above gripes, the fact that this disc shows a 2013 copyright on it is inconceivable. It came with an Ultraviolet copy, but that's almost a minus to me, sort of the red-headed stepchild of digital copy. What gives? What fricking intern made this DVD transfer and why does it still exist in this day and age? AAARAARRRGHH!!!This literally should be one of the very few open-package media returns that should be allowed for full credit. Beware of the copy in the gold cardboard packaging touting the ""Academy Award Winner for Best Supporting Actor (1990)"", at least you can know that is the CRAP version and you should try your luck with a different version. I see there is a 2 disc collectors edition out there with a printed top side to the feature disc indicating that it is at least a 1 sided copy.Unfortunately Amazon reviews seem to aggregate across all versions of films despite the media and version/release of the film so it is hard to filter out the copies of this movie which you shouldn't purchase on the basis of customer reviews, quite unfortunately in this case. If you look at one star reviews like this, you will see lots of people dissatisfied with the version of the film in 4x3 touted as widescreen, requiring you to flip the disc, etc."	1.0	Be extremely careful which DVD version you get!	2013-03-18	1	0	1

But the real star is Liotta with his creepy yet charming smile, penetrating eyes, and goofy laugh.  While the story is mostly entertaining, it is almost 2.5 hours long and drags in spots.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A23ESQ5UMIZH8D	"Scott P. Riegel ""Scott P. Riegel"""	Few films ever express a wider range of emotions than Goodfellas, a contemporary American classic directed by Martin Scorsese. Goodfellas, based off of the book Wiseguys, depicts the life of half-Irish Henry Hill, a member of a notorious mafia clan that makes money by stealing from the local airport, among other things. Beginning when he enters the mob at fifteen and ending when he ruins it at forty, Goodfellas, which is based on a true story, will entertain you from start to finish, and you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again and again. However, the films gets very violent at times, and it may be hard to watch for those with a weak stomach or a non-violent demeanor. Still, I'd reccommend this to anybody above the age of thirteen, and since, as stated above, the movie is filled with all sorts of emotions, there is truly something for everyone. At times a thriller, a romance, a comedy, or a violent crime drama, Goodfellas never ceases to amaze me with its astounding nature, and it is truly an American masterpiece worthy of the highest praise.	5.0	A Contemporary American Masterpiece	2005-01-28	4	2	2

It's a 140 minute movie, whereas the SOPRANOS DVD easily fits four 50-minute episodes on one side. Something is seriously messed up.And what's with the lack of extras? Two trailers is all we get?

You buy the DVD because it has great picture quality and features.So, my review is about the DVD itself.The first and biggest negative is the fact that it is on two sides of the DVD.  There is nothing more annoying than having to flip the DVD halfway through the movie.  There really isn't much else on there.  For me, seeing a grainy theatrical trailer isn't very exciting.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A24TQPT51AS05D	SGECKO67	Thats why after reading through many of the one-two star reviews I had to weigh in with my two cents.Right off the bat, this is one of the greatest films ever produced. Godfather still rates as my all time greatest American film. But this isnt the Godfather, this is the real story of a real gangster, in a real mob family. The Luchesse family to be exact. And it is not a tragic opera with universal themes with which we can all identify. These are hardcore criminals who live a life most of us would never want and probably have little contact with.So for people who said they couldnt identify with the characters, your not alone.Another complaint I read alot is the use of language. More specificly the dreaded F*** word. One reviewer even took the view of my middle class father (whom I love very much) and said &quot;Even gangsters back then didnt talk like that..&quot;Well how many gangsters did you hang out with back them days? From much of what I'v read that word has been in use going back to the 1800s and beyond. I understand that to some it and other words are offensive, but that is why we have a rating system. But like it or not, its reality.Now to my fellow Americans of Italian or Sicilian descent WHO are offended by these types of mafia movies, ...sorry, but crime stories sell. An earlier reviewer said 'this is just a thin sliver of the &quot;italian american&quot;experience' Exactly! Scarface(83), State of Grace, Once Upon a Time in America, Year of the Dragon, even Pulp Fiction all deal with a &quot;thin sliver of life&quot; thats what makes them so intresting. Most of us find it intresting taking a look into another world in which we would never set foot. Its got nothing to do with besmirching any race of people.I realize that answering complaints about this great film is a waste of time. But its great film made by a great director, and outta respect for him and it I had to speak up.	5.0	....It was outta respect.	2004-04-09	0	0	0

Being a long time Scorsese fan this is the film that got me started.  This is the first one of his films that came out during my lifetime and I have enjoyed it a couple times a year since I was about 8 (not that it's a good idea to let an 8 year old watch this film, it is very graphic!).  The direction is flawless as usual, the screenplay is wonderful, based on the bestselling book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese), and the acting is fantastic.  Joe Pesci earned a long overdue Oscar as Tommy, DeNiro is as incredible as Jimmy ""The Gent"" and Ray Liotta scored big with the lead role as Henry Hill which will always be his best performance in my opinion.

In other words, hoping that many (like me!) would sell off their old copies and order this new one.Well, you know what they say Warners...fool me once...With all that said, the Blu-ray version is a solid transfer, and I don't have to tell most of you how great the film is.

Kudos to Scorsese's visceral cinematic style, for this could quite easily have been your garden-variety gangster tale.The rough and tumble world of mafia can be intoxicating, as we follow our protagonist Henry Hill's rise through the ranks in the underworld (Liotta has yet to equal this incredible early performance). His voiceover permeates the entire film, breathlessly, in awe of the things he gets away with.He slowly ingratiates himself in this hood, first as a gofer and then to become a mid-level ""family member."" The appeal of the good life is summed up brilliantly in the simplest terms possible, ""I was a part of something.""It's both shocking and fascinating to watch these guys work. There's even an unexpected tinge of sardonic humor along the way, albeit the gallows kind.But between a constant cavalcade of Italian cheese and wine we soon discover that there's a reverse side to getting the best seats at plush restaurants and walking scotfree because cops are on dough. No one in this crowd seems to have a conscience, and eventually Henry begins to look over his shoulders even with his closest friends.His higher-ups include a hitman who is feared and respected in the organization (Robert DeNiro in an understated by chilling performance), a volatile loose canon who may make you laugh one minute and blow your head off the next (Joe Pesci), and the local kingpin who lets others do his dirty work and to whom respect must always be paid. Danny DeVito rounds out the studded star cast.Goodfellas has attracted flak for taking a sympathetic look at violent criminals, but let's face it, Hollywood is hardly to blame for the allure of the mafia. Plus, if anything, Goodfellas demonstrates better than any other movie on the subject how fleeting that heady charm is.It's the most ruthless depiction of the underworld I've seen apart from Scarface, an absolute catnip for mafia movie aficianados but a pretty good watch for the rest of us too.

0790729725	GoodFellas	AJ9W09EUQPAKE	Sirin	Goodfellas is a good movie, destined to stamp its mark on the modern age. It is a sort of ersatz Godfather - tighter, easier, more accessible than the great Coppola Trilogy (or rather, parts I and II). Scorsese uses a fast paced, dialogue heavy, boiler plated filmic style to tell the story (based on the true one) of mob informer Henry Hill. Perhaps because he uses a real story as his base, it has an oddly lopsided narrative structure - the film ascends to a nasty and brilliant climax two thirds of the way through, culminating in the famous 'Layla' scene - the Jim Gordon piano the musical background to a number of 'whacked' bodies turning up all over town. But by the end the pace has fizzled a little, and the last third is fairly thin fare given the explosive might of what has gone before.The film is gangster lite - the customs, routines, tropes, jargon are explained frequently by a rather intrusive voiceover. None of the dark roiling of the great gangster films - brutal killings with no explanation. Still, it is a great cast and the movie is brilliantly filmed. Liotta looks a little overwhelmed at the role he has landed, but De Niro is sublime, and Lorraine Bracco is beautiful, brash and vulnerable as Hill's no nonsense Jewish wife from the five towns.	3.0	Ersatz Godfather	2008-05-01	2	2	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	"Quite simply one of the best films ever made, and now its available on a proper DVD (i.e. not double sided).Based on the true story of Henry Hill it covers his life as gangster from young lad to middle-age. The film has everything, the script and direction are perfect and the performances from the cast are outstanding. For a film that 2 hours and 19 mins long, not a moment is wasted.Scorcese peaked with this film and although he has made worthy and noteable films since, none match this one. Scene after memorable scene occurs, the killing in the bar, entering the nightclub (the famous long shot) and perhaps best of all the 'funny guy' scene.Scorcese frequently refereneces other films and I wonder if the scene where Henry attacks the guy with the butt of his gun is a direct reference to The Godfather when Sonny beats up his sisters boyfriend.In an interview Scorcese said that at the end of the 80's there were a lot of films coming out with fast cutting, and this film was his response ""you wanna it fast - lets make it really fast"". Nowhere is this felt more than near the end when the pace of the film reflects Henrys high on cocaine.The extras on the special edition are pretty good, but you shouldn't be buying this film for the extras.

Now, over 13 years later, this movie still holds up like ""Citizen Kane"".  Probably the best gangster movie of all time!!  And without question the best film of the past decade.UPDATE!!  I just purchased the Two disc DVD set of Martin Scorsese's finest work.  Scorsese and actors Lorraine Bracco and Ray Liotta gives some great retrospect on the grounbreaking film. There is also a few documentaries on life in the mob. But my personal favorite is the ""real"" Henry Hill and the FBI agent who help him turn in Jimmy Conway and Paul Cicero giving their observations on the DVD extras.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A30A5I8FG82M2E	SpookyChick	"Look, I like Marty Scorsese more than most people.  He has made some of the best movies of the past 50 years, like ""The Age of Innocence"".  But the only good thing about ""Goodfellas"" is Lorraine Bracco's performance as a strong-willed Karen Hill (they should've called the movie ""GoodGal""! Wink!).Joe Pesci won the Oscar for an overly-showy role (I think it was the ""Whaddya mean I'm funny?"" bit that won it for him).  The statue should've gone to Graham Greene in ""Dances with Wolves"", which rightfully beat ""Goodfellas"" for Best Picture and Best Director.  Marty deserved an Oscar for ""The Age of Innocence"" but unfortunately wasn't nominated that year.  Costner's movie was recognized as the heart and soul of 1990, while ""BADfellas"" became synonymous with the horrendous ordeal America was unwittingly about to endure:  The Clinton Administration.Lots of ink has been spilled over the violence in this movie.  Yes, it is violent, but Marty would outdo even himself with 1995's ""Casino"".  Remember, ""Taxi Driver"" was once controversial for it's violence, but these days any child over 8 can recite Travis Bickle's ""You talkin' to me?"" routine.  ""Goodfellas"" dubiously opened up the floodgates for heathens like Quentin Tarantino to turn the silver screen red.  My problem is, as with Tarantino's work, the violent acts in ""Goodfellas"" are celebrated.  The consequences are not explored.The other troubling aspect of this visually-interesting film is the cocaine that Henry Hill becomes involved in.  The second half of the film is obsessed with drugs, and practically endorses dealing narcotics as a valid way of making a living!  Scorsese should've known better."	2.0	What stinks?

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3DY46ZABF4CMQ	"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer"""	Goodfellas is an astonishing motion picture directed by Martin Scorsese (Cape Fear), and starring Robert Deniro (Heat), Ray Liotta (Hannibal), Joe Pesci (Home Alone), Lorraine Bracco (TV show The Sopranos), and Paul Sorvino (The Cooler).Hailed as one of the best films in general, and best gangster film in particular, of all time, Goodfellas triumphs with an excellent cast, memorable screenplay, and accurate execution.Based on a true story, the film follows Henry Hill, played by Liotta in his starmaking role, a young Irish/Italian kid who longs to become a member of the local gang led by the quiet restaurant owner Paul Cicero, played by Sorvino. His gang includes the Irish bred Jimmy Conway, played brilliantly by Deniro, and the guncrazy Tommy Devito, played by Pesci in the role that earned him a well deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Goodfellas examines Hill's rise and fall with the mob, and eventually his abrupt exit from the gang after testifying against the big heads, Cicero and Conway, in a court of law in the early 80's. Today, Hill lives under federal protection.What makes Goodfellas an outstanding movie is the actual depiction of events that occurred, with all the violence and dialogue, that only Scorsese can pull off successfully with long takes (Henry and Karen's first date scene), and quick jump shots (Henry running errands under the influence of cocaine as the FBI are on the watch scene).RecommendedA+	5.0	"""To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States"""	2006-06-03	4	3	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	This is a 5 star movie given a 1 star treatment by Warner Brothers who seem to disrespect almost all their releases on Blu Ray.I don't provide opinions on the movies, the acting or give summaries of each film. That has been done many times elsewhere so I just provide information regarding the transfer of each of these film's from Standard Definition to this current Blu Ray.For the classic, 'Goodfellas', I cry with disappointment. The mbps ranges from the low teens to the low twenties and the video transfer shows no significant improvement over my Standard Def version. The audio is also lossy  5.1 with everything coming through the center channel and nothing in the surrounds or LFE; and again we have paid for a superior product of a superior movie and not received what we paid for.The video transfer appears to be the same as my Standard Def DVD with some grain throughout tho there is no artifacting that I could see. The disc stopped playing at the end of the scene early in the movie between when he comes out of court and then is shown as a grownup Ray Liota. I backed the disc up and played it again, this time not stalling out.  There is some video resolution improvement especially in the brighter areas where the contrast and facial tones appear a touch better than the standard def version but it is not a dramatic improvement by any means.In my opinion, if you already have the Standard Def version of this fine film, you really won't gain much by going to the BluRay version.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	1.0	GoodFellas on Blu Ray	2013-02-09	12	9	3

0790729725	GoodFellas	AS1KQ8H27S80Z	Steven Kuroiwa	I first saw this film in a movie theater and later saw it a couple of times on video.  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is not only one of Martin Scorsese's very best films but also one of the most realistic and convincing crime movies in film history.Based on a true story, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; chronicles the rise and fall of Irish-Italian American gangster Henry Hill(Ray Liotta).  Hill goes from slick mob dandy to drug-addicted paranoid and eventually winds up in the Federal witness protection program.Martin Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of the greatest crime movies in film history.  Scorsese's masterpiece is a successful blend of the satire and crime genres.  The ultimate result is a realistic portrayal of organized crime in the United States.  Scorsese's key players are perfect: Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.  Robert DeNiro is the last of the great screen actors and is both menacing and convincing as murderer-thief Jimmy Conway.  Although DeNiro is a strong presence, most of the story's emphasis is placed on Ray Liotta's Henry Hill.  The story is told through Liotta's eyes and he gives the best performance of his career.  Joe Pesci is great as the almost psychotic Tommy DeVito.  In a very tense moment with Liotta at a mobster get-together, Pesci utters a great and unforgettable line that is vaguely reminiscent of DeNiro's now-famous &quot;You talking to me?&quot; one from Scorsese's &quot;Taxi Driver.&quot;  Future superstar Samuel L. Jackson briefly appears as a robber.  Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi should also be praised for an outstanding screenplay.  The film has a great dialogue that is both creative and realistic.  Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; also possesses a powerful sense of realism that is sorely lacking in even Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Godfather&quot; masterpieces.  Scorsese's characters talk and act like everyday people.I plan to see &quot;Goodfellas&quot; again.  Well-recommended.	5.0	One Of Scorsese's Very Best	2001-07-27	6	5	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	AH7XLY8FI4AKU	susheel k sharma	Goodfellas is a raw adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. It follows the lifelong journey of an Irish-American mobster named Henry Hill. The movie starts with his childhood, growing up poor and his infatuation with the people that were feared and the people with the power-mobsters. Henry gets a job with the mobsters at the cabstand. His job is basically an apprenticeship with the leader Paulie Later in the film, Hil is all grown up and is a big time mobster. the adult Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta in the performance of his career. Liotta also does the voice overs throughout the movie. You are then introduced to some of his friends played by DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and his wife played by Soprano's star Lorraine Bracco. The great thing about this movie is how real it is. The mob movies that came before only focused on the good parts aboutmob life, but this film focuses on all aspects; the pressure from the hierarchy, the constant running away from the police, the conflict of interest between prison time r ratting out your friends. The film is directed by Martin Scorcese (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) and is similar to the other two films in the sense that it is a character study on the rise and fall of a man. This film is truly one for the ages.	5.0	Susheel K Sharma's review	2003-06-25	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	AW2RJ877DJSND	"T. Barnes ""Tmoney"""	Goodfellas is martin scorseses blunt look at the unscruplous life of Henry Hill, who dreamed of being a gangster growing up in his low life neighborhood. The film chronicles his &quot;rags to riches&quot; life that ends when he is forced to rat on his friends and enter a witness protection program. The film has a much harder edge to it than The Godfather; containing vibrant but grotesque characters that deserve little sympathy. The fast kinetic editing and period music add immensely to the overall effect of goodfellas. Not since Coppola has a director been able to absorb so many elements into a gangster flic but make it a creation entirely his own. Certainly one of the more violent mob movies made, it justifies every action made on screen. There are no filler scenes or excess blood to please the viewer. By the end, one has an understanding of all aspects of &quot;the life&quot; including that of the wives as well. With the exception of one scene, there are not too many surprises in Goodfellas, which speaks volumes about its power. It is able to keep the viewer hooked for 2 and a half hours moving from point A (Henry's childhood) to point B ( His exit from &quot;the life&quot;). Ray Liotta does a remarkable job in the lead role, but the supporting cast is brilliant. Pesci, DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, Loraine Bracco, and the rest of the &quot;crew&quot; make perfect caricatures out of the cliche gangster mentality.	5.0	&quot;I always wanted to be a gangster&quot;	2001-01-26	0	0	0

I don't know why this is, I can't say it's boring, but it just feels really really long.  Other downside, the last third of the movie.  It doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A34Q2RG2PS2OL	"the dirty mac ""boot64"""	"GOODFELLAS might be the most uncompromisingly honest movie ever made. This film can also be described as an extremely entertaining criminology class. Based on Nicholas Pileggi's biography of Henry Hill, WISEGUY, it's the first feature film that really delved into the everyday routine of life in the Mafia, showing how it operates as a world unto itself with its own customs, rules and enforcement mechanisms. So many of the movie's details strike exactly the correct note, right down to the food these guys cooked and ate. You could base an Italian cookbook on the screenplay.Collaborating with Pileggi on the script, Martin Scorcese trenchantly brings out the mindset that drives organized crime. In voiceover narration, Hill (played by Ray Liotta) lays out why the Mafia was such an attractive ""career option"" for guys like him. ""To me, being a gangster was better than being president of the United States....It meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies....To live another way was nuts. Those goody-good people who worked ... jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work and worried about their bills were suckers. ..."" Henry Hill is no hero. In fact, he raised sociopathology to an art form. (The book WISEGUY goes into much greater detail about Hill's ""activities."" It's unbelievable what he got away with.) But Scorcese does a magnificent and sometimes hilarious job in making us understand why Henry and his cronies do what they do.The acting is something to behold. Liotta has Henry pegged. It might seem strange to see Robert DeNiro play an Irishman like Jimmy ""the Gent"" Conway (true name Jimmy ""the Gent"" Burke). But of course this is DeNiro; there's no role he can't play. Lorraine Bracco, future SOPRANOS star, was justly nominated for an Academy Award as Henry's wife. Joe Pesci steals every scene he's in as Henry's smart aleck, ultra-violent partner Tommy. Paul Sorvino is in the role he was born to play as Henry's fatherly crime boss. Another fun thing, in retrospect, is spotting other future SOPRANOS stars besides Bracco. A young Michael Imperioli plays a mafia gofer who pays the price for disrespecting Joe Pesci's character. The actress who plays Tony Soprano's mother-in-law also plays Henry Hill's mother-in-law. We also see Tony Sirico (Paulie Walnuts) in the background in a couple of scenes early in the film.Scorcese pulls out all of his directorial techniques to extraordinary effect. What does he have to do to finally win the Best Director Academy Award? As always, he knows exactly how to use period music to enhance a scene without exploiting it or pandering to the audience. It's a pleasant surprise, for example, to hear George Harrison's ""What Is Life"" in that hectic sequence late in the film as Henry's world implodes around him.GOODFELLAS is also fascinating in that it chronicles the beginning of the end of the Italian mob's heyday. Henry Hill (his father was Irish) was one of the first people to rat out his friends in the organization, but he would not be the last.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1TKNGZXJB6T2	TheDVDReviewer	Goodfellas is, (in my opinion), one of the definitive films of the genre (exception of &quot;The Godfather,&quot; &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; and Martin Scorsese's most under-rated films &quot;Casino&quot;) and one of Scorsese's masterpieces. The film is shown through the eyes of teenager Henry Hill. Like his opening words &quot;I always dreamed of being a gangster. Even as a little kid, I dreamed of it. To me being a gangster was better than being the President of the United States&quot; the film starts out as a uncompromising look into the Mafia. Then Scorsese cuts to Henry about ten years later. He's grown into a successful mobster. We see one of Henry's best pal's Tommy. He's a gangster that scares most other gangsters. Along with Tommy is the excellent Robert Deniro playing one of Henry's mentors Jimmy Conway. A lifetime gangster, whose as lethal as a bullet. The way Scorsese tells the story is absolutely amazing. It's power not only lies in Scorsese's directing, but in the performance from Academy Award-Winner Joe Pesci. His performance still gives me bad jolts watching the film (which originally came out in 1990) even with friends. An amazing film, worthy of facing up against monumental films as &quot;Scarface&quot; and &quot;The Godfather.&quot; The only problem with this excellent film is the treatment they game the DVD. The sound is fairly crisp, but the picture quality is that of a VHS tape that has been rented out on too many times. The other problem I have with the DVD (and this is the truth) is that it is single-layered. Everytime I watch the DVD it ticks me off, because you have to flip the disk about two-thirds through the film. Now if they can fit &quot;The Godfather&quot; (which is about 3 hours and a few minutes) on one disk, then what's the problem with this picture? Terrible DVD, with little special features (a theatrical trailer and cast bios) that are worth nothing.	5.0	Goodfellas	2004-02-05	7	6	1

0790729725	GoodFellas	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	"The same year Francis Ford Coppola hit the skids with his flawed ""Godfather 3,"" Martin Scorcese reminded us how well-made mob movies are done with ""Goodfellas."" Here's the story of the rise and fall of a mobster, covering a span of 30 years from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although DeNiro gets top billing in this film, this is really a Ray Liotta movie all the way. It's surprising his career never took off after this movie, for his performance is really good. But while this film is undeniably a classic, the DVD itself is a bust. Although it is slightly over two hours, the film is divided on both sides of the DVD. I refuse to get up off my sofa to flip this disc over when the whole movie could be put on one side.  Plus, all we get for features is a trailer. No documentary, no commentary, or anything else. If you have to have this film, you are no worse off getting the VHS tape and waiting for Warners to come out with a deluxe-edition of this great film."	4.0	The Film is a Classic, but the DVD is a BUST!	2002-06-11	3	3	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A33FA68V0NCM5E	TheIrrationalMan	A brilliant, ruthless account of crime and the perils it entails. Ray Liotta, in an Oscar-worthy performance, portrays a novice who is schooled by two mentors, played by Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, in the game of bullying, smuggling, robbery and murder. The film charts the lives of the chief characters from a panoramic perspective, from the fifties to the eighties, and the scenes of violence have a mean, visceral, maliciously real, (as opposed to merely cinematic) quality. Martin Scorsese directs with a dazzling competence, developing some fascinating techniques of pacing and plot.

There isn't a whole lot to say about this film - every actor is incredible, from Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, who goes from a  idealistic young crook to an isolated and deflated man in the Witness  Protection Program. Joe Pesci is simply great as the psychotic gangster  Tommy DeVito. Robert De Niro is brilliant as always as Jimmy Conway. This  is a perfect example of Scorsese's directorial genius, and the  cinematography is excellent as well. Also, in a bit part, is Samuel L.  Jackson - another great actor who unfortunately doesn't get to show his  talent because of his very minimal on-screen time. Goodfellas is a great  movie, and a must-see.	5.0	Grabs you from the start and doesn't let go until the end	1999-12-05	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	"In 1990, Martin Scorsese made a movie about a real life gangster by the name of Henry Hill, who rose to power inside a mafia mob family during the 1950's.Ray Liotta stars as Henry Hill, and the story revolves around him and his experiences at living at the top of his world, only to come crashing down due to drug use and illegal operations that led to his arrest by the FBI. This movie also stars  the brilliant Robert De Niro and the equally fascinating Joe Pesci as Hill's fellow mob family members.The first 5 minutes of the movie guarantee that you will never know what to expect, as a regular car trip by the three friends leads to a shocking violent ending to a man in the trunk of their car. I will say that there are more violent acts just like that, but that only adds to the raw, real story of the plot, which was a true story I might add again.Liotta gives a great performance, having him narrate gives us a look at what Hill might have thought as his life continued to grow better as he met the mob bosses and their families, and how he became a slick young man with a wife, a girlfriend, and 30,000 dollars in cash that he pulls right out of his pocket.The movie also shows us the cruel side of the gangsters, as they repeatedly attack their victims who don't pay money owed to them. But then they are shown as a family who always looks out for their family members, even if they aren't even related. Thats where the term Goodfellas come from: That they only invite Italians to become with them, because they were ""Good fellas""Scorsese clearly shows just how different the families can be, going around showing the guys with their girlfriends, how the wives come together to gossip, and how just how rich Hill and his friends are when they take their girlfriends out on dates.Jimmy Conway, and Tommy De Vito, played by Robert De Niro [Conway] and Joe Pesci [De Vito] are shown as Hill's best friends, it was when Hill was a kid that he first met these two and they had been unseperable ever since.De Vito was the one that grabbed my attention, he was in some of the most funny and most shockingly violent scenes in the movie. From the funniest scene in which he is telling a story to his friends at a club; to him pulling a gun on a kid who tried to stand up for himself. Definately a show stealing performance by that man.Critics of mob movies say that this is the greatest mob movie ever made. Once you watch this I guarantee you will agree with them as I did.The second disk of this two disk dvd set also has some great features as well:GETTING MADE: Shows the documentary on how Goodfellas was made by both cast and crewMADE MEN: THE GOODFELLAS LEGACY: The filmmakers, including Joe Canahan, The Hughes Brothers, and John Favreau, comment on the movie.THE WORKADAY GANSTER: This takes a detailed look on the downside of being a gangster, from taking care of people, to being stalked by the FBI. Really a great look.If you are a fan of Robert De Niro [Who I almost forgot to mention was great also] Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, or Martin Scorsese movies, this is one collecters DVD you can't afford to miss."	5.0	Goodfellas stands on top out of all mob movies...	2005-05-01	3	3	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	AT7W1EXT0PF2Y	The Patriarch	"This is one of the silliest movies I've ever saw. Take our Main Character, Please. He can barely play a straight man let alone a gangster. Sorry writers, but a wimpy man with an affected accent telling us his life story is not a good movie. ""Now let me tell you about Paulie."" Sorry we don't give a damn. Next we have Robert De Niro, yep the man who played the Godfather got stooped into playing in this turkey. Sorry, Bob. At least his character is likable. Next in the trio is Joe Pesci, - after playing the villain in Michael Jackson's Moonwalker he got a big head and thought he was a real actor, sadly enough that role was Oscar worthy compared to this.If these guys weren't enough, enter our main character's girlfriend. She's ok until she starts talking, then its zero to tramp in 4.8 seconds. After about three consecutive scenes of this trollop in training I turned the movie off; and I've sat though some bad movies in my time. It'd be ok if this was supposed to be a comedy, but they try to pass it off as drama. Really, at one point we are actually introduced to a character named something like ""Jimmy Two-times - because he says everything two times. Says everything two times. I'm not making this up!

0790729725	GoodFellas	A3NA3G6R4DWFZL	Theresa G. Collins	This movie is one that I recommend.  The characters irritated me.  I enjoy Joe Pesci, but he was able to make me really dislike him.  That's the mark of an actor with talent.  Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta were just as irritating, so their acting was well done, too.  The character played by Ray Liotta had a laugh that made me want to turn the sound off - I truly hope that was a made up laugh.  Otherwise, I don't think he'd be very welcome at parties.  Despite the fine acting, though, I felt the story was too long.  And there were characters that were in the first part of the movie and then disappeared.  I was disappointed that nothing was said about where they at other times and what happened to them.There were a lot of actors in this movie that were &#34;small time&#34; at the time this film was made.  It was fun to see them and think, wow, he or she became big and I'm seeing them &#34;then&#34;.Since this was based on a true story, I can't help but wonder where the Witness Protection people are now and what they thought of the film.

Scorsese pays attention to every detail, but does not allow the flow of the movie to be bogged down by the incredible attention to details. This is the rarest of skills...the only other films that I've seen that perhaps equal this are the Godfather (Part 1), and Citizen Kane.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1UG48VINW0H40	"""the_watcher"""	A masterpiece such as this should really have a DVD version that does it some justice. The extras are virtually none existent.  There are two theatrical trailers, the usual cast and crew information(list of films etc) and the disc must be flipped halfway through. The fact that the scene selections are limited to 3,6,9,12 etc just reeks of sheer laziness. For fans of this film, I would not bother to buy this DVD. Either get it on VHS or wait till another better version is released.As for the film in itself, what can I say that has not already been said. Both the direction and the acting is superb. The soundtrack is excellent even for those who do not recognise the individual songs. What I really like about this film is the look in the eyes of the actors. Each of them seem to convey genuine emotion and the way the film is able to say so much with so little dialogue is one of its strengths. In that respect it is similar to the Godfather but is different in most other ways. I don't think it is fair to compare the two as they deal with completely different characters and situations. I would definitely recommend both films to get a full idea of top class filmaking. (It would have either 4 or 5 stars if not for the poor DVD quality)	3.0	Deserves better	2001-02-04	3	2	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A18XF4Q8Z3NF7D	Thiago Macedo	Murderers often come with smiles -- and problems of their own. Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro chew plenty of scenery, but the real focus of director Martin Scorsese's mob opus is Ray Liotta as real-world Irish-Italian mobster Henry Hill, a gangster who dreamed of making it to the top but landed in the witness protection program instead.Nominated for six Oscars (including Best Picture), the film's only win was Pesci's Best Supporting Actor statue. One of the greatest mobster movies and easily one of the top films of the 1990's, Henry Hill's novel Wiseguy is masterfully crafted by Martin Scorsese who showcases the lifestyle of a modern day gangster.Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci turn in career performances as a mafia crew who live the fast life and fall as each one succumbs to their own greed or vices. Scorsese shows Henry Hill as a kid working his way up in a crew and how he is drawn to a life of crime.Along the way he meets and marries a beautiful woman who knows what he does and accepts her life as a mob wife. The movie is filled with colorful characters and realistic settings; the dialogue is gritty and helps the movie establish the very violent setting and situations.Another reason Goodfellas works is the masterful use of music to showcase the era, it starts off with Tony Bennett singing Rags to Riches and culminates with Eric Clapton's piano instrumental classic Layla. It is the wonderful soundtrack that sets Goodfellas apart from other classic gangster movies such as The Godfather which used more traditional classical music.	5.0	Reality	2007-01-20	2	2	0

Gross	"The movie itself is a favorite of mine, and I was very much looking forward to a decent edition on DVD.There are two commentary tracks on this 2-disc DVD.  The commentary with the real Henry Hill is fascinating, as he watches the film and confirms that much of it is amazingly true to life.  It is really fascinating (and creepy) to listen to someone say something like ""oh yeah, I remember this, we were driving along and we thought this guy in the trunk was dead...""The cast and crew commentary on the other hand rarely speaks directly to the film on the screen.  It is a montage of comments from the Director, Producer, Writer, Director of Photography, and Actors (as well as others).  Co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi's comments are painfully, embarassingly banal and boring.  Lorraine Bracco's comments, on the other hand, are really interesting, in large part because she is one of the few to actually talk about what is being shown on the screen.  For the most part, you could just as well be watching any movie, or a baseball game, while listening to this commentary track.As it happens, I just watched Martin Scorcese's wonderful double-DVD set ""Voyage to Italy"" last week, and it is a reminder of how good his DVD commentary can be.  Unfortunately his contribution to the Goodfellas commentary is pretty sparse."	4.0	Great movie, of course, but the commentary is so-so	2004-08-19	7	6	1

Scorcese's upbringing in Little Italy gave him an affinity with the material that no other director could possibly have. These fine ingredients gelled to perfection.

This film is rated 18 for a good reason...there is plenty of swearing, blood spewing, face beating, balls kicking, and general gangster kick-ass stuff.The new 2 disc DVD is well worth the extra dollars, best of all you get digital sound and visual quality, and a commentary by Martin Scorsese.The plot, well not so much a plot as it is based on a true story, is about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) a small time gangster who builds reputation and, of course money. As he weaves through life more people get to know him, until he becomes one of the biggest gangsters in town, alongside his friends (DeNiro, Pesci). But, of course the `stardom' in his own right gets to him. Mostly in the form of drugs.Ray Liotta is very convincing as Hill. You get this feeling that he never quite understands who he is and who his friends are, or in fact what they all do for a living. He lives in a dream world, everything is at hand. Liotta is tough but you sense a weakness, a humanity, something his partners are missing. Especially Joe Pesci. For me, he made this film. He was absolutely hilarious as the short tempered, short in general mobster. Call him a d*khead and your dead, no questions asked. The best scene in the whole film is when all the guys are playing cards Paesi asks a young waiter for a drink, but he doesn't hear him. The young waiter argues he didn't hear him, then they start arguing. Pesci then wants him to dance, waving his gun at the boys feet, but, Pesci being Pesci, shoots his foot right off. Very funny.The film does a great job of portraying the close, but not too close relationships. As Hill says, the next shot could hold a smile on its face, meaning it could come from anyone, even your friends. It's dog eat dog. It's gritty, and damn right funny.	5.0	A Tough Old Cookie	2004-10-27	4	3	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A1ZJ30IS70IXAO	Tom Mestancik	This has got to be one of the best gangster films of all time.  I don't think Robert DeNiro has made a better movie.  Also Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta are brilliant.  I don't know why Ray Liotta wasn't in a lot of other movies because I think that he is a genious.  3 decades of Henry's life are in this movie.  First in the 50's when he worked at the cab stand.  Then in the seventies when he was a run around work guy for the mob and then finally in the end where he is living on his own.  This movie I give a 5 out of 5 rating because it has to be Hollywood's greatest movie ever. If you don't agree... I'm going to have to send Henry, Tommy and Jimmy down to talk to you	5.0	Brilliant	2001-07-17	0	0	0

Goodfella's has to be one of his better ones because they show you how a mob meets people  and then kills people and then teaches people.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2WAJWFB6ZPEGW	Toshifumi Fujiwara	the greatest thing about this new edition (besides that now it's an anamorphic master with better image, and you don't have to filp in the middle ofthe film like with the old DVD) is the commentary tracks.now, track number one is with the crew and cast. very enjoyable, but still regular stuff.what is so amazinng is track number 2: the cop and criminal commentary, with none other than Mr. Henry Hill himsself commenting on the film, which is his own life story.Scorsese deliberatlely made this film in a tongue-and-cheek manner, very fast, very light, very funny (he says he was inspired from Truffaut's JULES ET JIM).in the film people get wacked as if it were part of a gag. maybe because he thought that the way those guy lived, and maybe this was the only way to survive; never take any murder seriously, or at least you shouldn't show you're scared otherwise your partner will wack you next, as he may think you're unreliable.well, Henry Hill says that was exactly how they lived, telling to himself in many occasion that now, he cannot believe how he could do that. so Scorsese was right, as Henry Hill himself confirms.and to us, the commentary allow us to see the film, and the world it describes, in a new dimention. already at the film's nonchalant and shocking opening scene, Hill says he still sees that experience in his nightmares. and watching the movie with his commentary, we actually realize that, though on surface it's done in a rather comical way, it nevertheless does not miss the horror that the three main characters hide.also kind of scary with this commentary is that...towards the second half of the film, a lot of real names are erased with a buzz sound. of course because these stuffs can be still dangerous, that many of the guys are still alive and you cannot tell the names in public.the Henry Hill commentary confirm that as much absurd the universe of the film may seems to some, it's very authentic.among the cast and crew interview and the making-of documentary, the most interesting comments come from Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's faithful editor and most important collaborator since RAGING BULL (she aleady worked on WHO'S THAT KNOCKING ON MY DOOR, their first film).	5.0	great DVD--great commentaries	2005-01-11	3	3	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	Following the progress of gangster Ray Liotta and his relationship with mentors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the kind of film you'll either think is a masterpiece or wonder what all the fuss was about. Performances are all outstanding, Scorsese's direction energetic and innovative, but somewhere around the halfway point you may wonder where it's going and come to the conclusion that great performances and grandstanding direction is all its about. There's no shortage of outstanding scenes but the film becomes increasingly repetitive as it underlines and escalates its variations on a theme until it feels like it's all style with nothing more underneath than a two-and-a-half hour episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous.Good extras on the two-disc version, but it's hard to buy into all the hype for the film.	3.0	A great 90-minute movie dragged out over two-and-a-half hours	2008-04-28	2	2	0

It tells the story of real life mobster, Henry Hill, and his journey through the mob life and how he finally broke free when his &#34;friends&#34; were about to kill him (or so he thought) and implicated those very friends.  The voice overs combined with stop-action photography was an interesting touch.  The commentary between the cop and the crook, (Henry Hill and the guy who got him into witness protection) was especially interesting, as Henry made many comments about how he felt during that time and the people he admired, and one could tell that the use of the F-word was second nature to Henry Hill.	5.0	GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition) DVD	2013-02-11	0	0	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A31D8QKJXU93BT	"Vince Perrin ""Byline"""	"Soon into this movie about New York mobsters. there's a long tracking shot: a young hood (Ray Liotta), flush with money and entitlement, escorts his date (Lorraine Bracco) into the Copacabana through a side entrance; the couple navigate corridors, a restaurant kitchen, and enter the crowded club; there, a waiter sets up a table for them just as comedian Henny youngman opens his act with ""Take my wife, please!"" Its a bravura sequence by an artist who knows how to make movies better than most.That artist, director Martin Scorcese, is confident enough to cast in supporting roles his own mother and no less an acting legend than top-billed Robert DeNiro. Clearly, he has his priorities straight.Liotta stars ingratiatingly as a youngster/adult who aspires to gangsterism under the guidance of the local capos (DeNiro. Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci). Bracco strings along, enjoying the good life and raising their kids. All goes awry when Liotta falls afoul of the law and agrees to turn state's evidence against his former mentors, landing them in jail and he and his family in the witness protection program. The real man Liotta plays here wrote a best-selling book about all this and Scorcese collaborated with him on the script.Scorcese shows us the daily operations of a morally corrupt group of temper tantrum sadists, murderers and thieves who nevertheless dote on family, value loyalty, and protect their own. Pesci perfects the first of many psycho killers he's played in other movies. Francis Coppola moved the narrative in a stately manner in his ""Godfather"" films, while Scorese drives his briskly here. ""Goodfellas"" isn't yet ranked in the same league, but that the comparison even comes to mind suggests its inevitablity."	4.0	Friendly Persuaders	2005-08-04	1	1	0

A huge amount of sales would go up if he and Pillegi spoke on the  thing.  In addition, there is disc flipping involved? . On Casino, you  didn't even have to flip.

Ford ""carmaker43"""	I suppose you could say Goodfellas is ahead of its time and that &#34;The Sopranos&#34; looked to it as its inspiration, but there is really nothing new here.  Sure the cinematography is modernized, the sound recording is updated and the quality of the visual image has been vastly improved from crime family movies made in the 50s, 60s and 70s, and sure this movie is very entertaining and has a stellar cast, but it did not introduce anything new in the genre.  Blood and gore are more graphic, but the inner battles which some of the characters have to face have been faced by those same characters with different names and different locations throughout the long history of dramatic, crime oriented films.  Don't take this review in the wrong way; the acting is superb, the capturing of what it was like to be involved with &#34;the mob&#34; is electric and the soul-wrenching decisions to turn on those who supported you is marvelous to behold.  I saw this movie on a free download.  Would I pay to watch it again? Yes.  I should be getting my Blu-ray DVD in a day or so.  This movie is graphic, fast pasted and very real.

In hindsight, I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten a decent DVD.  This is a double-sided DVD, with the movie split in half over both sides.  This means that if you're watching it in your living room, you'll have to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the movie.  In addition, it is not anamorphic widescreen, so on a widescreen tv it shows up as a little box in the center of the screen (though on a fullscreen it should be fine).  Finally, it has no special features except for the trailers.

Perhaps strangely, in some cases, many law abiding Americans have a fascination with these bottom feeders who dwell in the rotten underbelly of our society.  In this instance, a snippet of the American melting pot originates from the backward, warped ancient Sicilian culture, itself a melting pot of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Moors, Spaniards, Carthaginians, Turks, and migrating barbarians from a plethora of Central Asian and African tribes.The northeastern United States has always been a landing area for Afro-Eurasian immigrants, many of whom have adapted seamlessly into the corrupt, criminal structures already well established there from the times of the Dutch and British occupations. This motion picture is not exactly a forensic study of the pathological &#34;Yankee&#34; criminality that is chokingly interwoven into the finished fabric of Northeastern society.  &#34;Gangs of New York&#34; comes closer to portraying that evolutionary process in a partially fictionalized slice of time. Instead, our occasionally loveable miscreants in &#34;Goodfellahs&#34; are presented as real, almost normal people, at times - not as caricatures of typical New York-types and hoodlums in the Cagney-esque mold.As for the technical rendering of the work into high definition media, I can't speak to that yet.

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	"Some films achieve moments we remember.  Others manage to evoke a time or a place through the careful marshalling of details. The real achievement of GoodFellas is that it does both things so well and so consistently. The amazing visual imagination of Martin Scorsese is the engine that drives it, sculpting one dazzling sequence after another into a cinematic whole. Unlike lesser directors, Scorsese manages to make the visual pyrotechnics look organic; emerging from the material itself, rather than merely being flashy.Henry Hill (Ray Liota) grows up and comes of age in New York during the 60's and 70's.  He is a product of Pop Culture Pressure - if you drive the right car, wear the right clothing, and use the right cologne or mouthwash, you too, can take part in the American Dream and become one of those smiling people in the magazine and TV ads.  The problem is that few of us can legitimately earn the money to fuel that kind of lifestyle and still have enough time to enjoy it. That's the real allure of being a Wiseguy, of being &quot;in the mob&quot;, or &quot;part of a crew&quot;: if you're willing to live (and possibly die) by their code, you can pretty much have it all.  Or so it seems.Of course, Henry learns - as do we - that there is a great price to pay for living high without actually earning it.  Henry gets most everything he wants - a lovely wife (played by Lorraine Bracco), some kids, a couple of houses, and the camaraderie of his &quot;coworkers&quot;; he also gets strung out on cocaine, investigated, arrested, and very nearly &quot;whacked&quot;.  By the end of GoodFellas, Henry Hill should also have learned what becomes obvious to us - that Wiseguy honor is an illusion; that the close-knit mafia &quot;family&quot; of the The Godfather is a literary fiction.  Then again, he probably does know it.  He just doesn't care.  The lifestyle is, itself, a drug that exerts a powerful hold.  Only mortal terror can lure him into the Federal Witness Protection Program.The large ensemble cast features exquisite work by Paul Sorvino, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci, who is given the most memorable scene in the movie - the famous and chilling &quot;You think I'm funny?&quot;  bit.  Rarely mentioned but just as effective is Chuck Low as the hapless Morrie, a guy who just doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut.The big disappointment in the DVD edition is that it's lacking in special features.  It's also a ""flipper"" - you have to turn the disc over halfway through the film to finish watching it.  I would love to see it reissued by Criterion in a dual-layer version with a commentary track by Scorsese himself.  That one would get five stars."	4.0	A time-capsule of Americana - Wiseguy style	2001-05-26	1	1	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A21EFMFTHHS9SE	"Winston Cheuk ""Apple Aficionado"""	I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Yet the DVD doesn't do this classic justice. First off, the movie is listed as being enhanced for widescreen televisions. Unfortunately, this only applies to the menus, not the film itself. Another major problem is that the soundtrack of this film seems to be mixed in Dolby ProLogic since there's a lack of surround action. And the biggest problem with this disc: it's dual-sided, not dual-layered. In the middle of the film, the disc stops and you have to get up and flip it. Come on: this isn't laser disc.Memo to Warner Bros.: Remaster this epic anamorphically, in DTS digital surround, and make it a special edition, 2-disc set with the film on a dual-layered disc and extras on the second disc.	1.0	Incredible movie, but&#65533;	2001-03-16	98	71	27

0790729725	GoodFellas	A2KD62P971YDYL	W. Noshie	`GOODFELLAS' is the life of the gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), starting from when he was teenager, until his exile under the Witness Protection Program.A perfect description of his life put in great scenery adding great music, cars and outfit from every period in the movie.Starring Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci; They couldn't have chosen better actors for this kind of stories.This is probably one the best mafia movies I have ever seen. If you later share my opinion about it, I would then also recommend:1. Casino2. The Godfather; all 3 parts3. Once upon a time in America	5.0	great Mafia Movie	2006-03-27	6	3	3
0790729725	GoodFellas	A3SN3GPLL3FNGB	Woody Baum	Goodfellas is one of the best movies of all time, but it's dvd layout is very poor.  it is 2 sided, meaning you have to get up in the middle of the movie and turn it to the other side, which is very distracting. also there are almost no special features.  if it wasnt for these two faults i would give it 5 stars, but it the faults took away from my viewing experience	3.0	great movie but not worth it on dvd	2002-02-12	1	0	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A1JPC6S4P5SVLM	WRII	The one and only thing that kept this film from getting a 5 star review is the fact that the DVD is not up to par.  You have to flip the thing over during the movie.  Considering the fact that you can get the whole movie on 1 tape this is totally unacceptable.  The film itself though is marvelous.  I consider it one of if not THE best mafia movies ever made.  Everyone needs to see this film at least one time in their life...if for no other reason than to be familiar with some of its often imitated lines.  &quot;Funny? Funny how?&quot;	4.0	Wonderful film, but the DVD...	2001-07-20	0	0	0
0790729725	GoodFellas	A2QQ5O2TFZPTIH	Wu-Tang_Assassin	Wow, what a movie. This is probably my favorite movie of all time. This movie has an excellent story line (based on a true story). The acting is VERY good, Pesce, DeNiro and Liotta do an awesome job in acting in this movie. Each scene in this movie, leads very smoothly from one to the other.I recommend this movie to any fans of mob movies, anyone that likes a lot of action and a story with a really good story line.Joe Pesci is by far the best actor in this movie, dont pass watchin this up!!	5.0	Goodfellas	2005-12-31	3	3	0

0790729725	GoodFellas	A1YKFF88146FIA	"""xtophile"""	Get ready to ride the sound button on your remote.  I don't know about the quality of the original sound mixing...that could be the culpret--but at the very least the sound mastering of this DVD in non-existant.  It is impossible to enjoy this film in this format.  Each scene requires you to reset the volume.  It is completely unacceptable.	2.0	Unwatchable DVD of a great movie	2003-03-04	3	2	1

I got the movie rather quickly and watched it while the cd was still cold from winter travel lol. The movie itself I believe is one of the best. @-disc special edition is waaaay better then just the movie. A must get!	5.0	Nice	2007-03-29	2	0	2
0790729725	GoodFellas	A3C7Q102XH70GI	Zach Pickett	This is one of the best mob movies ever made.  With its great and true tale of one of the Lucchese family earners, it proves to be not only a great film, but also a great look into the world of organized crime.The movie starts out right away with Henery and his two friends driving down the Jersey turnpike when their &quot;pakage&quot; in the trunk wakes up.  Right there you are hooked.A lot of reviews said that this was a very violent movie, which it is, but in my opinion they kind of over exagerate.  The director shows the violence very real, and does not let the audience down with some watered down version, in my opinion, it is what sets this movie apart from the other mob movies, and into a league of its own.	5.0	An &quot;A+&quot; movie by an &quot;A+&quot; director	2003-07-26	7	6	1
0790729725	GoodFellas	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"First things first, this movie is not overrated. If you want to see an overrated crime film, watch Scarface (the movie that every 13 year old rap fan seems to salivate over after seeing their favorite rapper display his/her copy on MTV's ""Cribs""). I'm a big fan of Robert De Niro (he's my favorite actor) and Martin Scorsese (my favorite director next to Stanley Kubrick), so this movie was a true treat. The film is based on the real life gangster Henry Hill.This film is very memorable by top class performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, but Ray Liotta steals the show. There are only two movies on organized crime that you need to see. The Godfather and Goodfellas. Goodfellas brilliantly and according to many real goodfellas, accurately depicts mob life. In my opinion,  this is a true 5 star film. From the screenplay to the acting to the directing, it's a masterpiece of filmmaking. It just seems as though everyone in the movie is custom fit to their role. Very, very few films achieve that. So many memorable lines and scenes, its too many to list. I know this review doesn't say much, but trust me, this movie is a must see!- Zack, 16 years old"	5.0	The greatest mob film of all time!	2005-11-02	0	0	0
