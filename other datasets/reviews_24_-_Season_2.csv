B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1GFSSTCOU9DVX	Aaron S. Chauncey	Though I never really got a chance to watch this when it originally aired, I have found myself locked-in on it now that it has come to DVD.  This set just plain ROCKS!  The images are clean, clear (and widescreen), and the sound is very nice.Surprisingly, there are 44 deleted scenes included!  Try finding that on any other TV boxed-set.Overall, I highly recommend this set for any fan of Keifer Sutherland, dramatic shows, or just good television in general.	5.0	How TV on DVD should be	2003-09-11	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1U0HUXO9GLOUD	"Akira ""gigatonx"""	24 follows the story of Jack Baur, an inactive Counter Terrorism Unit agent.  At the present time a nuclear bomb has been smuggled into Los Angeles and its set to off today.  The only person that can get the job done is Jack Baur.  Each episode represents one hour in the day and during this time you get to see the  different situations each character experiences.After hearing all the buzz about how great 24 was I decided to check it out for  myself. After I saw the first episode I could not believe at how good this series was.  After each episode I was tempted to the watch the next and then next.  This probably one of the most captivating series that when its over you'll be eagerly anticipating the next season, especially after the huge cliffhanger in the last episode. This show has it all great plot, the most interesting characters, and enough government conspiracies &amp; action to keep you on the edge of your seats.*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*	5.0	24 is just to addictive	2004-04-15	4	4	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A32NKYSXN832TE	Alder	Perhaps the passage of time since Season 2 first aired, reveals the formula. Pick the form of terrorism that we fear the most, sprinkle with bits of chick flick, chop and mix and add Kiefer Sutherland. Now that we know what NSA actually did and what role Diick Chaney and Rumsfeld actually played, the appeal of 24 Season 2 diminishes, slightly.  It is still good, just past it's prime. (Sorry about the pun, Amazon.).	4.0	Season 2 is NOT as good as Season 1	2014-06-29	0	0	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3TLY1A7NGVCQM	"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP"""	"I have a high threshold for excitement. Most movies are slow moving, boring and predictable. Major league football puts me to sleep. Hockey only keeps me awake because of the noise. In short, it takes a lot to get my heart rate above 56. 24 can put me into fibbrillation. I dream about it after watching more than one episode.My daughter comes down to see me literally on the edge of my seat during an episode. She laughed ""Dad, now I know what they mean by edge of the seat thrills, every time I see you your're about to fall off the end of the chair.""The two spotlight reviews give a lot away. I really don't like to drop spoilers in a review so I will stay arms length from the plot. In 24 just about anything you say about classifies as a spoiler since so much happens and the plot is an intricate chain of events with just about everything linked. Just knowing who is recruited to help Jack can totally ruin the end of Season 1 for someone who hasn't seen it.The public knowledge about this season is that Jack Bauer is no longer with CTU. George Mason is in charge. Jack is off the payroll recovering from the events of last few minutes of season 1. This is a year later. ( real time again) Tony Almeida ( great character and terrific work by Carlos Bernard)  is back with a new CTU crew.Word gets out, there is some sort of nuclear device in Los Angeles planted by a terrorist group called Second Wave. David Palmer is President. ( hell, I would vote for David Palmer! )There is a link with a domestic terror group that flags Jack Bauer. He was undercover with this group and is the only guy with a half chance of infiltrating them again in order to track down the nuke.Jack also has to ally with an old enemy - name witheld to prevent a spoiler. The plot starts in overdrive and picks up speed from there.The plotting is intricate, all events relate to all others. The race is on to find the nuke and save LA. There are several more subplots with of course Kim, Jacks daughter in trouble again. I guess the family aspect helps add tension to Jacks mission, but that subplot is lame compared to whats happening at higher levels of the government with the conspiracy leading all the way to the uppermost echelons of government.Like Season 1 the action is non-stop. There is at least one major shocker in each episode and each one ends in an irresistable cliffhanger that will have you cueing up the next one right away not even wanting to take a minute to review the ""Previously on 24"" spot. You want it NOW!In any other show or movie the plot would climax after they find the bomb, or course trhe guys would cut the green wire and that would the that. Nothing so pedestrian would ever make a 24 Episode.In 24 you can ever count on them finding and disarming the bomb. Maybe they do, then again maybe not - I won't say here. But whatever does happen with the bomb I will say that the plot INTENSIFIES from there!Like with Season 1, I had an impossible time turning off the DVD player until the disk was finished.I didn't expect S2 to have the thrills and excitement of Season 1 since I knew a little more of what to expect from the show but if anything I was even more out of breath after these episodes.One thing though, 24 will spoil you for most other TV shows and movies. Get used to the real time format and everything else seems lame. The only other TV show with the edge of 24 is maybe the new Battlestar Galactica, but that isn't the same serial format and no where near as addicting as 24.24 is addicting and beware. Once you start you won't want to put them away until you're done.The producers, directors and writers do a marvelous job of hooking you into the plot and caring about the characters and even feeling their pain.Watch this show. It is the best of the best. This is as good as TV gets folks.I come up with a great idea for a 24 party. Get a bunch of hardcores together and watch it real time. Start at 8am and play the disks realtime with the clock. Only break to bathroom and eat during the commercial gaps. Cue them up and restart on time."	5.0	I have a high threshold for excitement	2005-03-01	0	0	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A6D0CTJVRY84H	Alex Braden	24 has done what no other show in televison has done before, they have mastered the art of taking 5 different people and simultaniously showing their day.  By then end of the season you feel like you know the characters and think this might actually be a real story.  The way it is produced makes it seem like it goes faster than it is.  It doesnt seem like a full season by the time it ends.  To take the ability to take a Tom Clancy novel with all of its characters and points of view and make it into an easy to follow, suspenceful and action packed 24 episodes is probably one of the greatest accomplishments of Televison Arts today (NOTE: Tom Clancy Novels are not being reproduced in this show as episodes or seasons).	5.0	A Tom Clancy Novel on Television	2003-08-18	1	0	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	ACWQTVLZHVNJH	Amazon Customer	I've gone to movies before, shelled out my 10 bucks and left the theater disappointed.  This happens more frequently these days.  Often action adventures are just preparing you to see the sequel which is the same formula replayed over and over.  I'm tired of it and finding  there is not that much that is entertaining enough to warrant the expense.  However, after watching all of Season 1 and 1/2 way through season 2, of 24,  I realized that I'd gotten such a thrill ride from this show  it exceeds some of my happier moments in any theater.  Today I realized my whole Prime membership, if I did nothing else this year, was worth it to be able to this show.If I was walking out of a theater this would be one my &#34;that was worth it&#34; moments.  My only complaint so far is that women in the rolls are either weak, stupid and getting into ridiculous situations because of that, are traitorous and conniving.  As a mother to young women, I like to see  females  portrayed as courageous and strong as the male protagonist.  Film has always been done this way so 24 didn't invent that characterization, that criticism aside, this is an edge of the seat, incredibly entertaining show with less silliness and fluff of anything else on TV	5.0	Makes prime worth it!	2014-05-23	0	0	0

I'd caught the occasional episode here and there, and been impressed, but couldn't fit it (or much TV at all) into my schedule. Thanks to the gods of DVRs, I was able to see the first season during the recent A&E glut, and am hooked. The 2nd season is even better, with the tension sliding along a knife's edge, the relationships mind-bogglingly intricate, and the action non-stop. Kiefer Sutherland is superb, and obviously shares in the vision for the series. The writers, cast, crew, and producers deserve hearty rewards for delivering one of the best 24-hour movies I've ever seen.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3EW4TUSY1HAXC	Andrew Mcdonald	If season one gets 5 stars (which I gave it), season two gets 3 and 1/2 stars.Yes there is more action, yes the stakes are much higher, but the personal and gritty feel that made the first season a thriller is sadly absent.For starters, I wish that they had shaken up the cast to avoid the smell of a typical Hollywood sequel. In fact all of the major characters (except Terri, of course) are back again. I was disappointed with their decision to bring Sherri and Nina back even though I'm a fan of Nina. But, if 24 were as real as it thinks it is, Nina should have spent the rest of her life in jail (though, I loved the interrogation scenes between Nina and Jack!). Fortunately, by season four they wisely decided to put a lot of fresh faces in the cast.By far, the worst thing about this season was their decision to give Kim a huge chunk of the time.  Whereas in the first season she played an important role in being the bad guys' leverage against Jack, this time she is utterly irrelevent to the main plot of the nuke threat. The writers did an abysmal job with the role they assigned her this time.How did this girl live to be in her late teens when on a typical day she's kidnapped, held hostage, arrested for murder, and chased by wild animals?!? Note that those were independent events that I listed! Some people think Chloe (seasons 3, 4, 5) is annoying but at least Mary Rajskub can act and can come across as caring without being condescending.Overall, this is a good season. If you are a fan of 24 by all means buy it. BUT the magic that made 24 brilliant is in season one.	3.0	Why, oh why did they put Kim in this?!?	2006-06-20	10	10	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	It all begins at 8:00 a.m.  18 months after Jack Bauer prevented the assassination of Senator David Palmer, things aren't looking good for the CTU agent.  His wife was killed by Nina Myers minutes before she was caught, his daughter Kim blames him for the death, and he has been out of commission ever since.  But those problems are only the beginning.  It is revealed that a terrorist group named Second Wave plans to detonate a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles sometime that day, and the only lead that CTU has is linked to Bauer.  Palmer, now the President, had George Mason, now the Director of CTU, immediately reinstate Bauer so that he can infiltrate the lead and find out where the bomb is.  Along the way, many secrets come out such as a conspiracy within the government to allow the bomb into the country, and all along, Kim keeps getting into more trouble.  Once again, this proves to be one of the greatest shows on television.  You will be hooked from the beginning, and you will never want to stop watching.  The main difference between this and the first season is that, while the first season was more personal towards Jack and Palmer, this one has more at stake.  I gurantee that you will love this DVD.	5.0	Another Very Long Day	2003-05-23	10	8	2

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1NA3GK5HCXMJH	"Andy Perhach ""24"""	Jack Bauer returns!!  24, the best show I've ever seen on TV, roared back for its second season.  Once again, lots of twists and turns that you don't see coming.  Non-stop action all the way.Kiefer Sutherland is easily the best actor on TV.  His portrayal of Jack Bauer in this season is expanded a little more after what he goes through in the first season.  Jack is more careful, and doesn't trust as easily.  Tony is back, as is David Palmer, who has quite a tough day himself.The only drawback for me in the season is Kim Bauer.  Don't get me wrong, she's certainly easy on the eyes, but the character had no real purpose in this season.  All of her misadventures really didn't add anything to the season, except stress for Jack.  It's only a mild complaint though, as no show I've ever watched comes close to touching 24 for action and suspense.24 is an addicitive thrill ride.  I'll be starting to watch season 3 shortly, and can't wait.  This will always be my favorite show, and it is well worth getting a hold of all three seasons to enjoy over and over again.	5.0	Another Long Day for Jack	2005-03-03	8	7	1

My family and I have watched many episodes together.  It's more fun to watch &#34;24&#34; with more people, because you feel the excitement and reactions more deeply.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A8SPV5DEIV7JJ	"Anonymous Action ""Jim"""	"Fabulous season. While the character Jack Bauer is always amazing, other supporting characters also make this show outstanding. Classic hero characters are cornerstone characters Tony and Michelle. George Mason, Karen Warner and Lynn Kresgee are also heroic as excellent supporting characters to the story.I thought what epitomized the show was at the conclusion of episode 13. They show on the multi-screen one of the characters; Michelle Dessler. You see a complete picture of her. As the screen moves slowly from left to right, you slowly see less of Michelle, then see Cassie Turner looking (spying) directly upon Michelle. At that point Cassie then looks upwards toward the  director Tony who wanted Cassie to ""spy"" on Michelle. It is just symbolic in that in this show there is an attempt to ""take down"" (not kill) Michelle. Later there is an attempt to ""take down"" Tony. There is an attempt to ""take down"" Kim Bauer. There is an attempt again to ""take down"" David Palmer. There is always an attempt to ""take down"" Jake Bauer and America. All the ""take down"" attempts are absolute fun as the season unfolds. Each subplot is exciting fun. Excellent show. I highly recommend."	5.0	Another Great Season	2007-10-14	1	1	0

I have to say, so many aspects of the show were so dumb, and yet I stuck with it. started season three, got through 5 episodes and cannot do it anymore. It is so far fetched, nothing believable about it. And the characters are some of the dumbest people on any shows I've watched. Daughter Kim is so irritating!

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2GPDWM14MFCR8	Anthony R. Nelson	24 is the best military drama on tv. I was first introduced to the incredible power of 24, when FX had the season two marathon. Before that I had heard this and that about the show but had never gotten to watch any of it. Once season three began to air I started watching it on a regular basis. Now I own both season one and season two, and I am a very loyal fan, I have nothing bad to say about 24The season two storyline had a very strong impact on the viewers as well as all of America. Following the very intense and tragic incident of 9/11, the writers of 24 wrote a story that we could not only relate to but could feel with intense emotions.Following the very tragic death of his wife, CTU agent Jack Bauer decides to resign from active duty. Estranged from his daughter and isolating himself from the rest of the world he now lives in a Los Angeles condo. Until one day when the President calls him and personally request that he return to CTU in order to help them on their latest mission. What is the mission? There is a dirty nuke in LA that has been brought into the country by a middle eastern terrorist group with the help of some american businessmen. The ultimate plot? Detonate the bomb on american soil. Why? So that america can start a war with the middle east. Some may ask &quot;Why would american businessman want to start a war with the middle east?&quot; There could be many reasons, but for the sake of those who have not seen season two, I will let you find  out the reason on your own.24 is a very intense and realistic show. There is no doubt that some may not be able to handle it. But for those who can I suggest that you get your hands on both season one and season two, I promise you will not regret it.	5.0	24 is the best military drama on TV.	2004-06-16	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A34A7QEBMYTALW	"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged"""	"After a fabulous first season that saw Jack Bauer stop the assassination of the president, '24' returns for a second season.  This time Bauer must stop a nuclear warhead from going off in downtown Los Angeles.  The creators of the show upped everything:  the violence, action, doublecrosses...everything was notched up.  Which was good up to a point.  I was totally into it throughout the entire search for the bomb, but when the main focus switched over to the search for a computer chip...it just seemed like much less was at stake all the sudden.And why must the makers feel the need to put Bauer's daughter in constant danger?  The very annoying Elisha Cuthbert(does it bother anyone else that she has dark brown eyebrows and platnum blonde hair?)has a day that rivals her father's but not in terms of importance but in annoyance.  Its truly irritating to be deeply involved in the main story and the scene cuts to Cuthbert fighting a mountain lion.  Other than Cuthbert, the performances are great.  Kiefer Sutherland owns the role of Jack Bauer.  Dennis Haysbert is so good as the President that he could run for the real office and I'd probably vote for him.  And Carlos Bernard as Tony Almeida is the unsung hero of the series.  He turns in a great performance every show.The writing is very tight.  The dialogue is good, except for the fact that the phrases ""within the hour"" and ""in real time"" are overused.  Other than the few too many red herrings, the story is very well done and chugs right along.  Like I said, when the focus switches mid-season from a nuclear bomb to a computer disk, its a bit of a letdown.Overall, '24' is a very good television show.  While not as good as its first season, the second is still worth checking out especially for its excellent first half."	3.0	24 Again	2005-08-21	12	11	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	"Given that the ""24"" writers are the only ones in television attempting something like this, I suppose it's not surprising they do not seem to feel the need to improve on their writing from the first season. The real time gimmick is still a big enough gimmick that they seem to be coasting on it.And that's a pity. The writing in this second season of ""24"" is flabby, silly and typically telegraphed miles and miles off. Fans tuning in looking for edge of their seat thrills aren't going to find them here; they'd be better off switching from Fox to sister station FX and ""The Shield.""The very first hour telegraphs things that the characters will be blissfully ignorant of for several hours -- Hey, there's a conspiracy inside the White House to subvert the president's authority! Hey, this cartoonishly evil bully Kim works for isn't going to just let her get away with defying her authority! Jack is mad and he's a loose cannon!Plot elements seem to have been lifted from online fanfic: When running from the evil father, Kim runs, not into the crowded public street, but into an alley empty of people; Kim is an au pair instead of a nanny despite the fact that most people have no idea what an au pair is and despite the fact that she neither seems to be a foreign student nor a college student at all; an expensive sports car's trunk conveniently springs a leak in time for police to investigate the sudden gusher of blood despite the fact that even the cheapest car trunk won't drip a drop if you spill a 2 liter of soda back there (learned the hard way); no one seems capable of getting along with each other, and instead White House officials and intelligence agency officials alike have to snarl half-threats at each other and refuse to do even the most rudementary cooperation; this bizarre inability to connect with each other extends outside the workplace -- instead of calling up his estranged son and saying he's been badly hurt on the job, the humorously named George Mason has his son arrested and brought in wearing handcuffs, in a failed attempt to win the Father of the Year award.If they cut most of this nonsense out -- along with the entirely pointless Kim storyline -- the show would be half its length, which just might make it tight enough to watch. As it is, this is a rental, at best. Flabby, slow and silly."	3.0	"Feels more like ""48"""	2005-03-21	32	16	16

The other stuff is exciting - a cliff hanger at every episode that will, if you're not careful, start a binge-watching session that could take an entire day (hey, like 24 hours worth? minus commercials, of course...)Also, not bad to start philosophical discussions with the family - there are deep questions about the ethics of war, the limits of executive power in our constitutional republic.

The only notable downside is the storyline of Kim, which is confusing and full of random and veru unrealistic surprises.  The DVD set in itself is very good.  Lots of deleted scenes and extra, well worth the money.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3PQJAEIRWW32L	"B. Hart ""The Head"""	Season 2 is good, but not like season 1.  There were plenty of suprises and twists.  For a counter terrorism unit the LA office in this show continues to be compromised, I would think they would be smarter.Speaking of smart, Kim Bauer's character is not.  I think they killed the wrong character in the end of season one.  I really don't know why they wrote her in this season.  Her storyline has nothing to do with the main plot, and all her problems stem from her stupidity.The acting here is a little weaker.  Bower is in a plane wreck where a big wooden branch is shoved in his leg, tortured until he dies, revived, and has effects that only last for that episode.  It is if the writers figured that the viewers would forget the past injuries after waiting a week or two between episodes.Like I said, this is good, but not like the first one.	4.0	Not as good as the first one	2007-05-05	4	3	1

You will NOT be able to watch one episode at a time.  In particular, I would highly recommend that you not begin watching the 4th disc unless you have a 4 hour block of time to watch everything.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A5MKK9956JMFM	"""bmwhite5"""	As this season opens, Jack Bauer's (Kiefer Sutherland) life is falling apart.  His wife was murdered, and his daughter, Kim has disowned him.  Suddenly he gets a call from the President of the United States (expertly portrayed by Dennis Haysbert) asking him to stop a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.Upon accepting the mission, Jack is thrust into an emotional game of mystery and deciet as he goes undercover to uncover the location of the bomb.  One of the highlights of the season is when Jack is reunited with Nina Myers (Sara Clarke), Jack's former co-worker at the Counter-Terrorist Unit, who is responsible for murdering his wife.The real-time aspect of the show helps to build the tension as things get steadily worse for Jack Bauer.  Attention is given to every minor detail in order to maintain consistancy throughout the story.The characters constantly change throughout the story as the situations gets more intense.  George Mason, Jack's untrusting boss, learns to respect Jack's unconventional methods and in the end is willing to sacrifice himself so that Jack can have a second chance to put his life back together.  Tony, Jack's friend, will eventually try to hinder Jack's investigation, which has the potential to prevent an all-out war!Based on the features of the previous DVD, we can expect the season to be presented in the Widescreen format, with surround sound, and a preview of what is to come in Season three.  I know I speak for every fan of this series when I say I can't wait!	5.0	Jack Bauer is back and better than before!!!	2003-03-30	33	24	9

If there's one thing I like about season 2 of 24 and 24 in general is that you never know who's gonna get and that's kind of how life is. The show is predictable in the Harry Potter since that we know Jack and the good guys will win in the end as Harry Potter always does, but the journey is not so predictable. I also like the hard life and death decision that the president and Jack must make. Sometimes there doesn't seem to be a right or wrong answer and it's always good fodder for debate.	4.0	Jack Bauer of James Bond	2014-04-03	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3H2CKTFZ3B3GD	Brian Hawkinson	Seeing as how the first season went, I don't blame the second season for not being as suspenseful and on the edge of your seat.  Be that as it may, the season still held your attention for every single episode and never once waivered.  Again you never really know exactly what is going to happen, but what did happen isn't as dramatic as the first season, isn't so mouth open in shock, which is why this is only ranked four stars.Enough of season one, season two is great.  If you like season one, you will enjoy season two just as much.  Buy it, watch it, become addicted and stay up all hours of the night to finish a disc, only to be forced to have to play some more episodes.  It is that good.

Of course, Jack Bauer is the most admirable of modern heroes, and Kiefer Sutherland gives another perfect performance, having to step up to the call of the very job that made him a widower.  But I also admire the character arc of CTU boss George Mason, (Xander Berkeley plays this character so masterfully, one of my favorite characters), a middle manager-type, finds his true self, and comes thru like a champ.  I really liked Kate Warner, (played by Sarah Wynter), a caring woman who found the courage to brave a number of situations, simply because it was the right thing to do.  Was kinda hoping she'd wind up as ""Mrs. Jack,"" but she was certainly a strong, memorable character and integral to making this season, Day 2, a winner!"	5.0	Day 2:  characters reaching within to find their Inner Selves and inner strengths	2014-06-12	0	0	0

It's literally the ticking time bomb. But what really carries the show is the script and the superb acting.No one really chews the scenery but rather underplays the tension.  President Palmer is the lynch pin of the cast and the plot.While at times Bauer's daughter Kim seems to go from the frying pan into the fire, it does make you want to scream at the screen and shout, ""Don't go in there, Kim.""  But the other subplots are skillfully written and stitched together nicely.The character of George Mason makes the biggest character arc and probably should have received at least an Emmy nod for his role.I only wish more television was of this caliber."	5.0	Best Drama on the Tube	2008-08-15	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A17GC3FTMQPFL5	bridge	24. The groundbreaking television series that made Kiefer Sutherland one of television's most memorable heroes in recent memory. The writers clearly struggled to make it through Day 1, so could they make it through a full 24 harrowing hours and keep things as tense and thrilling as in Day 1?The answer, thankfully, is yes. This season improves many areas of the show, while, unfortunately, losing some ground on others. For starters, the DVD is insanely better than season 1's. This one has CHAPTERS (thank heavens) to make watching the episodes easier. The picture and audio are clearer, there are commentaries (one per disc - 6 discs), and there is a special extra features disc featuring some interesting documentaries.Jack, one of TV's coolest characters, is back and better than ever. He has a classic moment at the end of the first episode to remind us why we love him so. Kim too is back, still reeling from the loss of her mother. But whereas she was a pivotal figure in season 1's story, she really has no place here, and it shows. Kim's sordid tale alone is enough to rate this season lower than the first. She does have a few saving graces - all conversations with daddy Jack (which are few and far between, but very good).CTU members Tony Almeida and George Mason are back. Tony's given a little more to do here and is sans his oh-so-memorable soul patch. And Mason, one of the best characters in 24 history, is given a more principal role as acting director of CTU. Mason is one of the few characters in 24 to EVER crack a joke and have a sense of humor.Palmer too returns, now as President of the US. Palmer's story is a lot of just recapping what's going on, but he does have quite a tangled web of traitorousness to unravel before him, and he makes quite a few surprising moves. Palmer doesn't have the intensity he had in Day 1, but he's lost none of his wisdom and intelligence. He does make a somewhat...erm, not too wise decision that he follows throughout the final 11 or so hours, but if that's what it takes to keep the story going, so be it.The story is a bit larger and more topical than season 1's more personal and small story. Each side have their pro's and cons and I suppose they balance each other out well. The story's evolution leads to some truly amazing moments and fantastic cliffhangers. The double-crosses are innumerable and a few of season 1's more devious characters make very memorable returns (one in the last THREE minutes of the day).Overall, this season is not quite as solid as the first. The villains aren't as villainous, their motives aren't as powerful, and their schemes are less realistic. There are some plotlines that just won't die (Kim, Carrie, etc.). But despite all these flaws, there's always Jack Bauer to keep us glued to the screen. It's still better than anything else on TV.	5.0	The Jack Bauer Power Hour Returns...	2004-04-04	3	3	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	First airing in November 2001, 24 quickly established itself as one of the best television series around and solidified itself as a cult classic icon. Utilizing a novel premise, each season of 24 comprises a single day in lives of its characters, with each of the 24 episodes representing a one-hour time segment of that day. Kiefer Sutherland stars in the imminent role of Jack Bauer, a government agent periodically faced with enormous challenges within a single day. Each season is reminiscent of a fast-paced Hollywood action thriller, but it's only a busy day in the life of the heroic Bauer...Season 2 supposedly takes place eighteen months after Jack's big day in Los Angeles. Jack is now dealing with the death of his wife and is estranged from his daughter Kim. As a result, he contemplates retirement. But when President Palmer personally requests his help, Jack agrees to take on a new assignment. In so doing, Jack learns that a Middle-Eastern terrorist group called Second Wave is going to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles in the next 24 hours. Yet again the clock is ticking, and yet again, only Jack Bauer stands in the way of an evil conspiracy reaching its final fruition...The 24 (Season 2) DVD features a number of breathtaking episodes including the season premiere which begins with President Palmer and his son fishing in an Oregon lake when he's called away for an emergency. Ushered into an underground bunker, he learns of a terrorist plot to set off a nuclear weapon in the Los Angeles area in the next 24 hours. At the CIA's Counter Terrorism Unit, George Mason is ordered to contact Jack Bauer in respect to the case, but it takes the personal appeal of President Palmer to move Jack into action. Meanwhile Kim, working as a housekeeper/nanny, overhears a domestic dispute between her boss and his wife, and she locks herself and the man's daughter in a bedroom. As the episode concludes, Jack learns that the key to uncovering the whereabouts of the nuclear device may lie with a domestic terrorist organization he once infiltrated... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include (#31) in which Jack and Nina set up a sting to see if a contact can lead them to the site of the bomb, and (#46) in which Jack stands on the verge of making a break in the case but has his efforts thwarted by the president's ex-wife, who's involved in the terrorist conspiracy...The DVD Report	5.0	An original, fast-paced series...	2005-04-21	7	4	3

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1CBIEDRRVM4CR	Carlton M.

The only organizations that have any discipline are the bad ones.  I'm sure, though, that in two week's I'll be all into the 3rd season.  The show is compelling and fun and I can't stop popping in the next disc.The scary part it that this is how people probably look at the political decision making process.  Just remember its a cartoon and have fun counting down how long it takes someone to be implicated, taken hostage, or has to play a little subterfuge.

But it's amazing how they can keep the plot so involved and make 24 hours seem like months. I had to keep reminding myself that when a wound isn't healing, for example, it's because it's taking place on the same day. Some of it seems a bit over the top, maybe a lot over the top, but Keifer Sutherland's acting is superb, nonetheless.	4.0	Exciting Show	2014-01-06	0	0	0

I politely questioned this seller about the product, but instead of responding in a professional manner, I was met with sarcasm. I responded with some clarification and thought I might get an apology or a mild form of ""sorry about that,"" but I never heard from him again.I thought about whether or not I would give this seller a poor review. It was not something I set out to do, because I'm not trying to hurt anyone's business. However, he had an opportunity to apologize and he blew it, and this attitude shows a total lack of regard for his customers.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AE42JLYPXUI45	"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)"""	When 24 had premiered it's first season back in late 2001, fans all over were raving about the show. But the writers were not about to just give up on the show after one season. Kiefer Sutherland returns as Jack Bauer, and he is about to have his second bad day.It has been a year and half since the events of the first season. JACK BAUER (again played by Kiefer Sutherland) is still in grief over his wife's untimely death and he no longer works for CTU. He had quit after Teri's death. He and his daughter KIM BAUER (again played by Elisha Cuthbert) are estranged from each other, but they are trying to work out their relationship. Kim is working as a live-in nanny for a family, until she finds that the husband of the girl Kim is nannying turns out to be physically abusive to both his wife and daughter.After a brief visit to Kim, Jack receives a phone call from DAVID PALMER (again played by Dennis Haysbert). David is now in office, well has been for the last year and a half. He informs Jack that there are plans of a terrorist attack on L.A. The plan is to detonate a nuclear bomb over L.A. Jack returns to CTU and is greeted by TONY ALMEIDA (again played by Carlos Bernard) and GEORGE MASON (again played by Xander Berkeley). George is now the head of CTU. He has taken Jack's place after Jack had quit. After Nina Myers had been arrested and taken to jail for murdering Jack's wife, CTU has brought in a new employee to take Nina's place. Replacing Nina is MICHELLE DESSLER (played by the beautiful Reiko Aylesworth). She and Tony seem to have a personal interest in each other. Jack decides to help out Tony, George, and Michelle through the day.Off-hand, there is a family residing in L.A., they are the WARNER family. Mr. Warner resides in L.A. with his daughters, KATE WARNER (played by Sarah Wynter) and MARIE WARNER. Marie is getting married today. But all of that unfolds as CTU closes in on Marie's fiancee, Reza. But CTU finds that Reza is not involved with today's threat, for his fiancee...Marie...is the one involved, after they find out that she has killed Reza. Jack decides that Kate should help out CTU, whereas Kate agrees to help do anything to stop the threats from occuring.David has enough power to handle this day's threats, but he wants to bring in extra help. So, he decides to bring in SHERRY PALMER (again played by Penny Johnson Jerald), his ex-wife. All seems fine until Sherry stills shows signs of her being against David, rather than help him.Throughout the course of the day, CTU tries to locate the nuclear bomb. Jack finds that the person who authorized the location of this bomb is none other than...NINA MYERS (again played by Sarah Clarke). Nina has a lot of key information for CTU. She says she'll only help if she is allowed a presidental pardon. They allow it to her, with David's authorization, just so they can get rid of today's events. CTU locates the bomb, whereas Jack is the only one to plummit the bomb into the ground, destroying it. But to do that, Jack would have to be killed in the process of plummiting a helicopter. But George Mason has stellowayed on the chopper. Earlier, George had been infected with some sort of infectious gas, where he will die int he next 24 hours. He has Jack skydive out of the chopper, where George will take the plummit, since he's dying anyway.Saved by Mason's dying deed, Jack still has to find out the terrorists who are still trying to bring L.A. down. He finds Sherry Palmer with one of the men involved, but the man Sherry is meeting with kills himself, forcing Sherry to help Jack out with the leader of today's terrorists. Jack and Sherry successfully pull it off, whereas Tony and Michelle officially become an item, with Jack and Kim finally working things out between them, whereas Kim has killed the man she was working for, since he had tried killing her.The first season was extremely intense, but the season was even more intense than the first. I really enjoyed the season and you all will too. Get a copy of 24: Season Two. You all better hurry; the clock is ticking.Episode List8am-9am9am-10am10am-11am11am-12pm12pm-1pm1pm-2pm2pm-3pm3pm-4pm4pm-5pm5pm-6pm6pm-7pm7pm-8pm8pm-9pm10pm-11pm11pm-12am12am-1am1am-2am2am-3am3am-4am4am-5am6am-7am7am-8am24: Season Two CastlistKiefer Sutherland: JACK BAUERElisha Cuthbert: KIM BAUERCarlos Bernard: TONY ALMEIDAReiko Aylesworth: MICHELLE DESSLERSarah Wynter: KATE WARNERSarah Clarke: Nina MyersXander Berkeley: GEORGE MASONPenny Johnson Jerald: SHERRY PALMERDennis Haysbert: PRESIDENT DAVID PALMER	5.0	24: Season Two (2002-2003)	2005-12-25	3	1	2

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AZVEPWRYOFBX5	Charity Bishop	A man screams in agony as various tortures are inflicted on his flesh. He refuses to tell his tormentors anything until the pain becomes too great; he reaches his breaking point, and screams out what they want to hear. The information is rapidly taken to President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), on a fishing sojourn with his son. The recently elected, divorced politician and his media team are astounded and disturbed to discover that a nuclear bomb is planned to detonate sometime in the next 24 hours in the city of Los Angeles. Palmer orders a High Terrorist Watch and his staff contacts all agencies across the Midwest, alerting them to the danger. He has one request of the Counter Terrorist Agency in L.A to get Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland) on the case.A year after the devastating events surrounding the death of his wife, Jack Bauer has quit his job at the CTU. His daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) is attempting to recover outside her fathers influence and now works as an au pair for a wealthy young couple in the suburbs. He refuses to become involved until a phone call from the president asks for his time and patience. He agrees to visit CTU and listen to a briefing by George Mason (Xander Berkeley), but promises nothing. When learning the truth, Jack refuses to assist them, instead making a phone call to persuade his daughter to get out of LA as swiftly as possible. While en route to his car, he sees a mother and her child walking along the street and changes his mind.Together with fellow agents Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) and Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth), Jack is determined to stop this bomb from going off. He will have to go deep undercover, with serious consequences. The CTU is targeted, his life is placed in danger, and an involvement from high-class government shakes Palmers presidency. Numerous incidents are set to occur on this date, including the marriage of Marie Warner (Laura Harris) to an Arab-American. Her older sister Kate (Sarah Wynter) has never liked or trusted Reza and hires a private investigator to look into his financial accounts, fearing he may be embezzling from the country. What she finds instead drags her into the midst of chaos when CTU shows up on their doorstep. Kim also has serious problems when she discovers her employers husband has a penchant for domestic violence. She will stop at nothing to protect Megan (Skye McColle Bartusiak) even when it comes to kidnapping.As a television series, 24 is successful because you have time enough to digest each episode and await the next, but watched consecutively becomes increasingly more unbelievable. The concept that anyone could live through such an unholy amount of terror (kidnappings, beatings, shootings, car accidents, and torture sessions) in the course of a single day is just plain fabrication. The plot moves swiftly on some fronts, slowly on others. Kim's storyline is believable for the first half dozen episodes but then becomes predictable and slow: everywhere she goes, you know inevitably it'll turn wrong. She meets up with one psycho after another, some of them with dark intentions, others just unintentionally freaky. Palmers political end of the spectrum is intriguing enough for a while but then bogs down in endless plot twists. By the time an actual decision is made on whether or not to bomb foreign countries in retaliation, the viewer has grown tired of all the bantering. Poor Jack loses one snitch after another, goes through hellish torture experiences, and winds up carrying a full load. His story, and the trials of Michelle and Tony at the CTU, is the most interesting.Fans of the first season will be pleased to see some of the same characters back in the second, with a heavy dose of new faces to balance the familiar adrenalin-pumping episodes. George Mason, self-professed jerk, redeems himself. Tony goes through some morphs, being likable and yet villainous when it suits him best. Michelle is the most emotionally attractive character, and some conversations will bring even the most hardened viewer close to tears. This DVD collection is also much more charitable than the first where content is concerned. There's no outright sexual activity (there are implications), less profane language, and redeeming messages. The content is still grueling, the storyline rampant with unsavory torture scenes (usually the victim is stripped naked, but the camera is careful not to show too much), and many shoot-outs. In one of the first episodes, Jack delivers a severed head in a leather bag. Many people are shot and killed with gory results; the body count is extremely high.A dead woman's bloodstained body is found in a trunk; a man throws his little girl to the floor, hitting her head on the edge of the bed. Kim is forced to defend herself numerous times, taking a tire iron to a mans head and shooting another person dead. In the aftermath of rumors of attack, Americans are provoked to retaliate against innocent Arab citizens. Several men attack an Arab agent and beat him to death. Jack is forced to remove a computer chip from a dead mans body; the camera lingers on the blood. Television programs don't have anything higher than a TV14, but 24s violent and thematic content is closer to an R. The torture scenes are the most difficult to watch, as people are burned, stabbed, electrocuted, cut with electrical blades, and injected with various painful medications. My biggest problem with this is that most of the time, good guys are involved. I cannot condone torture under any circumstance, and do not take pleasure in seeing the hero use it, even for the good of the country.When an Arab refuses to give information, Jack beats him and then forces him to choose between his information and the life of his son. (SPOILERCTU did not kill his eldest child; it was staged to gain cooperation.) After shooting a female suspect in the arm, he refuses to give her pain medication and squeezes the wound to make her talk. He learns vital information from one man by telling him his death will be painless if he cooperates (the spy was injected with a slow-acting medication that makes his lungs collapse so he suffocates). Palmer also condones the torturing of a cabinet member in order to discern if he was in league with foreign terrorists. I also did not appreciate the obvious Bush Administration bashing in the last several episodes. There is also some language (mostly mild profanity and abuse of deity, although various characters use the term screwed and d*cked around once or twice).Carefully obscured nudity appears in the first episode and several thereafter. A woman intimates shell sleep with a man if hell give her something out of her boyfriends locker. They go into his office and close the door. Present are themes of racism, blackmail, brainwashing, and political corruption. A man is shown vomiting in one scene; another suffers from radiation poisoning with mildly gruesome results; a bomb goes off in a terrorist unit, killing fifteen people and wounding others. A woman is deliberately detained from going to the hospital in order to gain information, further jeopardizing her life. Kim is also locked in with a mentally deranged man who we fear might have aggressive intentions, but nothing comes of it. She's seen in a t-shirt and panties in her opening scene; her employers husband looks lustfully at her. Several times her tank top becomes mildly sheer.For die-hard action fans, 24 is fabulous. It has many twists and turns, emotional highs, and down-to-the-wire cliffhanger endings. But its also extremely violent, much of its subject matter is cruel, and many of its themes challenge the viewer to wonder when enough is enough do we condone torture in order to gain information, sacrifice one life to save thousands of others, or rationalize bad behavior? The means are just as important as the end. This is my primary fault with 24 they make out that as long as everything turns out all right, the means of getting there isn't important.	3.0	Parental Review	2013-03-21	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AR2Q4X6FAP276	Christian J. Harris	The intensity of 24's second season was greatly heightened by its coincidence with our fear of the war on Iraq.  Moment after moment hit so close to home, yet it also contained personal touches much like its first season.  Many people wonder whether or not the show can keep going.  Once the novelty of something wears off, then what does it have?  However if 24 was all about its ticking clock and real-time structure, then the novelty would've worn off a long time ago.  I'm no longer &quot;fascinated&quot; by the format of the show like I was in the beginning, but I still love it for its tension.  I care about its characters because the weaving in and out of the many storylines is done so beautifully.I will say that this season dropped the ball in at least one way; Kim's storyline was rather expendable.  Many fans believe that she should be killed off, but I stand for the notion that Elisha Cuthbert is too good of an actress to let go.  The problem with the Kim plot has nothing to do with the acting and little to do with the situations she's put in.  As a matter of fact, I think that the events of her day are compelling within their own right.  However what Kim goes through has very little, if any, affect on everything else that takes place on the show.  Other storylines all strengthen one another - take one away and the plausible and/or intensity of the others is greatly diminished.  Take Kim's story away, and you probably wouldn't know the difference; so with it there, it's merely distracting given the urgency of potential war and genocide.We should care about Kim simply because we care about Jack's love for his daughter, but in the world of 24, if it's not important to the plot then fans don't care.  But I'm not so sure that killing off Kim is the answer.  In the coming season (3), they could very well write her off then make the same mistake with another character.  While they may not be able to come up with another plot that hits close to home like season 2 did, as long as they keep the tension and connect the storylines, season 3 has potential to be the best yet.	5.0	I'm ready for more!!	2003-10-27	2	2	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2EL8QDYV6ZGIJ	Christina B. Erickson	Jack Bauer is back on the scene as information regarding a nuclear bomb in LA is discovered.  I watched this whole season in three days because at the end of each episode there is a major cliffhanger.  And not only is there Jack and CTU to keep up with in this season, there are also other fascinating characters including the President of the US and his staff, a wealthy suburban family getting ready for a marriage and an old villian brought back - all of which are tied into the nuclear threat somehow.	5.0	Best Season	2005-02-28	1	0	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1CYOHNGQ1WED1	Christopher Hivner	Jack Bauer is still recovering from losing his wife, and his daughter isn't speaking to him as she is also still trying to recover. The last thing Jack wants to do is go back to work, but there is a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles and one of the men who knows something about it is someone Jack dealt with when he was working undercover. Reluctantly, Jack is pulled back into his old life and spends the next 24 hours desperately searching for the bomb and the people behind it while trying to get his daughter out of LA in case the bomb does go off.Season 2 of 24 crackles from the very beginning and has some great twists. The action never lets up for long and many times you wonder what Jack will do next as everything seems to go wrong. Kiefer Sutherland gives a great performance and the screen is more alive when he's on it. Dennis Haysbert is commanding and authoritative as President Palmer while he tries to figure out who he can trust as members of his own staff work against him. Nina Meyers makes a surprise return. The interplay between her and Jack works on many levels. Overall one of 24's best seasons.	5.0	Action packed, filled with twists and turns	2009-03-30	0	0	0

If you can't, you will not be able to watch it. Now, Keifer Sutherland is a superb actor. He plays Super Man Jack Bauer...an indestructible SuperHero with unlimited Super Powers: never gets hurt, travels at the speed of light, can hit any target with a pistol, is the most intelligent person ever created... etc. Only Jack Bauer, singlehandedly, can save the World! All the Villains are intensely Evil. If you like watching Bad Guys..specifically, Terrorist Moslems getting killed you will love this Series.. and that is a big plus. The Villains also has Superhero Powers and intelligence..however I guarantee you will get sick of Nena Myers popping up again and again and pray that she gets killed... The actress who plays Agent Michelle Gessler is the worse Actress that has ever appeared in the history of TV. She makes all these weird faces in an attempt to portay seriousness... it just makes her look mentally deranged. The actor who plays Tony Almeda is almost as Bad. They both reappear in Season 4, at about the same time...I am sure you will be disgusted with these two. After watching Four Seasons, I recommend you watch each Season as fast as you can. Otherwise, any person with average intelligence will lose interest...if you have time to think about the Plot you wil realize that ""24"" is really just a TV Comic Book: Superhero against SuperVillain... it is Fantasy with a big dose of Violence...and that's what the viewing public seems to want."	3.0	24 Tips: The Best Way to watch this Fantasy Series.	2008-07-12	4	2	2

I am a 24 addict but still cannot bring myself to watch it week after week on FOX.  I'd much rather buy the DVD package and watch the thing in a matter of a few days (this time it took me 6 days), sort of a Kiefer-binge I guess.I was skeptical as hell about the second season because I didn't think anything could be better than the first season.  I'm very glad I bought it now.the only thing I really wanted to write this review for was to mention something I didn't care for on the DVD package.  on each episode's submenu, there is a picture next to the menu.  if you see the picture, you can pretty much figure out what happens in some of the episodes.  I suggest looking away while playing with the submenus, like I did.  or you could cover up the screen with your hand (there are actual benefits of having a 13&quot; TV).  the people who put this thing together should've played a little to us who didn't watch the show when it was on TV.that is all	5.0	4.5 stars, here's why	2004-01-10	5	3	2
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"The second season of 24 offers a more logical story than season 1.  There are less coincidences, fewer vanishing characters, and a tighter control on the overall plot.  For watching the show on DVD, unbroken by a week between episodes (not to mention advertising breaks), this is vital.  Sure, the series still suffers from some of the same coldly logical problems of Season 1, e.g. it seems you can get from anywhere in L.A. to anywhere else in 10 minutes or less, irrespective of the time of day.  But there are precious few other illogical happenings in this second series, which makes it more enjoyable (and easier to watch multiple times) than season 1.This plot this time: information comes to President David Palmer (last seen as a candidate for that office - obviously he won the election and is early in his tenure) that terrorists have a nuclear weapon.  Because the weapon will go off that day, and the series starts at 6 am, simple arithmatic tells you that the bomb will be discovered (or go off) on or before episode 18.  But the real story is not necessarily finding the bomb, but also finding out who is behind it.  At various stages we are led to suspect the following: a terrorist super-group (like al-Qiada) is responsible, the governments of several ""Middle Eastern"" countries are responsible, the bomb is actually a conspiracy in the U.S. government, the bomb is controlled by local (U.S.-led) terrorists.  And just because one possibility is apparently eliminated doesn't mean it won't come back later!  Into the situation is drafted Jack Bauer, still grieving over the murder of his wife at the end of Season 1.  Palmer personally orders Jack onto the case, and he proceeds with psychopathic glee to torture and murder his way through the case.This season is not for the squeamish.  There are a number of scenes of torture that are surprisingly graphic.  The subplots with Kim (Jack's daughter), are difficult to watch for a different reason - they are pointless and irritating.  Any terroists that act like these do would be caught in hours - they kidnap Americans, leave bodies lying around, etc.  Those are only minor strikes against the show, though.  Generally, the pace is hectic, the plots interesting, and you're left wanting more at the end of each hour.  Unfortunately, a bigger strike against this season is that there are 3 or 4 shows near the end (after we discover the fate of the bomb but before we discover who's responsible) where the writers are obviously just trying to fill time to reach 24 hours.  If this season was called ""21,"" it would have been vastly improved.  Finally, to avoid naming real countries, the producers rely on what they hope is geographical ignorance on the part of the viewer.  At one point, the origin of the terrorists is identified by a wave at a map of North Africa (say, Algeria-Libya), while later American bombers are having to pass over Turkey on the way to their targets, which would be impossible if the targets were the previously identified Libya or Algeria.A lot of these issues will only be noticed by DVD viewers like me who watched the entire series over the course of a month, rather than over the 8 month TV schedule.  I make no apologies for that, since this is a DVD review!  Speaking of which, this package contains many extras, much more than Season 1, and some of them are quite good.  The highlights for me are featurette on the effects of blowing up the CTU office, and the commentary that includes the actress who plays Nina."	4.0	More logical than Season 1 (and better), but a few hours too long	2006-09-22	9	8	1

It has a simple story to start with - there is a bomb in United States of America. Enter Jack Bauer, grieving at what he has lost in Season One and had resign from CTU. But the President Palmer needs him to locate that bomb... and its another 24 hour run of his life... that almost nearly kill him.I have to admit, this is the best Season Two I have watched. This time I didn't get sick. Watching all 24 episodes had me up and reeling for more. It has the action any TV fan would want. It has the story anyone will enjoy. And most of all, the intensity of the story that grips you from beginning to the end.With the extras of over 40 deleted scenes, 2 featurettes plus other extra stuff, you can't go wrong with this season. And most of all, you can never go wrong with this series.I can't wait for Season Three to be out on DVD (because I am not able to watch it in my country) but at the mean time, Season Two will keep you watching... and the clock is ticking again...	5.0	Faster, Better, Crazier - Season Two is better!!	2004-02-09	1	1	0

Even when u have watch the whole 24 episodes the first time round, i still have to watch it again to find out how u could tell who the bad guys were and how the ending came to be what it was. The second season is by far the best because it has some of the best caharacters like George Masion and his very cleaver one liners. For instance when he gets exposed to a radioactive substance while following a lead and a specialised paramedic says that he has to take his clothes off he asks: &quot;aren'tyou going to buy me didnner first&quot;. he was the best character that season and made me laugh a lot.The second season also seem to have a high death toll and you could always rely on Kim getting into some form of trouble, which was annoying at times but was reaslly just a break from the other stuff that was happening at that time, gave you time to breath. The ending was a bit of a schocker and even watching it back did not make any more sense, but then again the ending was was really a proper ending like the first one because it was one where you had to wait for to the nxt season to see what happens. That was a good thing to do because then that ensures that the people who watch the 2nd season will definately come back to watch the next one. But that also ment having to wait nearly a whole to find out the out come.By now the 3rd season is on our scenes on sky one (UK) and this is still capativitng but not as instensive as the other two and so far not as high a death toll as the second one.	5.0	Amazing	2004-03-19	1	1	0

I can say this because aside from the drama, there is better character definition and way more going on.  It also contains an extra disc (seven in all) that contains all of the special features you could want.  Many exclusives that you cannot get anywhere else.  The set also comes with information on how to get the book of Jack's Grand Jury testimony and many other things from the first season that were left unfinished.Season 2 does not begin the next day, rather a little over a year later.  It grips you from the every beginning to the very end.  I purchased it yesterday and watched it all the way through.  I don't have the time to do that, but I seriously called in to work to do it.  It's that engaging.  I would recommend this to anyone out there seeking excellent television on DVD.  It is once again in widescreen format which brilliantly captures each heart-stopping episode.Three cheers for Fox...The only thing I did not like was the decoration of the box.  It is not completely consistent with the first season so it looks different on the shelf.  That is a small complaint for a huge show.	5.0	Better than the 1st.	2003-09-17	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A230JG643DRO84	DARTH SIDIOUS	The second season of 24 was sensational in terms of Suspense, action,plot and specially character development. Also some people complained that this was just another way of America exploiting the war on terrorism. Well i am a MUSLIM and i disagree. Its just a tv series not a documentary. It wasn't meant to be taken seriously or inflict more hatred of Americans towards the Arab World. In a lot of the James Bond movies the villains were mostly Russian but that wasn't because Americans had a grudge against Russia. And in Speed Dennis Hopper played an American terrorist but it didn't mean that the writers of Speed hated their country. It was just a movie. So if you didn't like it just say so but don't say that you didn't like ONLY because of the refrence to the war on terrorism!Anyway in Season 2 a nuclear bomb has been planted in Los Angeles. President David Palmer has no choice but to call Jack back to CTU for another day of hardships. Mason, the new head, is, of course, not happy about this. Now, his daughter Kim is running from her employer, who is threatening to kill her. Palmer now must deal with his political staff, most of which are plotting against his actions on how to deal with the crisis. And Jack must face the toughest challenge of his life... finding the bomb with aid from the woman who killed his wife, Nina Myers. The clock is ticking...A small warning though. Season 2 is a lot more violent than the first. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!!!	5.0	Even Better than the First season	2003-09-23	11	11	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	Wow, an even better season than number one.  It seems that all the pieces really started to fall into place with this season as it begins running on all cylinders.  Jack is back, after his wife's death, and Keifer plays him with perfection.  And of course, Nina eventually is back, played even better this season.  And of course, Kim Bauer is annoying and whiny and won't listen to Jack at all (and then gets caught in a bear trap - it could happen?!).  I like the addition of new characters in this - Kate Warner for one does a great job although she constantly has a goofy look on her face.  All in all, this season is highly enjoyable and my wife watched it in only a few days!  Not as good as the 4th season, but still awesome!  Do yourself a favor, though, and watch the first season before you watch the second.  I hate when somebody tries to watch it out of order and then complains about it!	5.0	"""MR.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	I'll admit it---I'm addicted.  This show is amazing entertainment and kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire season.  I'm so glad they are putting these episodes out quickly.  I was a &quot;johnny-come-lately&quot;, panning the first season and tuning in for the second season on a whim.  I was hooked with the first episode and couldn't get enough.  Thankfully, at the time I started watching, Season One was out on dvd, so I bought it and caught up on Jack Bauer's adventures.  Now, I'm jonesing for Season Three but in the meantime I have this new dvd set to enjoy with lots of interesting features, such as 44 deleted scenes, commentary and featurettes that make this 7 disc set a worthy addition to your collection.  Jack's next horrific day on the job starts with the threat of an atomic bomb smuggled into Los Angeles by an international terrorist organization.  This sets of a chain of reactions that become one spell binding turn after another.  I won't go into much detail about what happens but you'll be biting your nails by the end of each episode.  Keifer Sutherland is great as Jack Bauer, the CTU agent that can handle almost ANY situation.  Dennis Haysbert is perfect as David Palmer, a very charasmatic President, who uses Agent Bauer when he gets into a tight spot.  My personal favorite, Penny Johnson, as the delightfully sneaky and scheming, Sherry Palmer, is back for Season Two, adding plenty of guessing and twists for the fans.  Daughter Kim is back too (played by Elisha Cuthbert) stumbling into trouble and keeping her dad busy trying to save her, as well as the entire city of Los Angeles.  I'm hoping they reduce her role in Season Three and make her a little less danger prone.  Other than that, I have no complaints about this incredible show.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AESPP8H6PG602	Dave Fruge	The producers did an awesome job on this box set!! I didn't think the 1st season of this show could be topped. Then I saw season 2! It involves Jack Bauer tracking a nuclear bomb set to detonate in L.A., &amp; the people responsible. I won't give anything away, but it has more shocks, twists &amp; surprises than are possible to count! In fact, at the end of one hour, something happens that is taboo, &amp; wouldn't be thought possible.Now for the details on the D.V.D.: This is much better done than season one. For one thing, unlike the first set, the &quot;previously on 24&quot; retrospectives that start the episode are included. With so much going on, they give you updates on each individual main charecter. They also count against the clock that's running. Better than that, though, there are one or several deleted &amp;/or extended scenes per episode. You see a small &quot;24&quot; inside a box pop up where these scenes would have taken place. Press the select/play button on your remote, &amp; the scenes run. So, to sum things up, wether you're a die hard fan, you missed season 2, or you just want to refresh your memory before season 3 starts on 10/28, BUY THIS!!!! YOU'LL GET EVERY PENNY'S WORTH, PLUS ENOUGH LEFT OVER TO MAKE THIS THE BARGAIN OF THE MILLENIUM!!!!!!!	5.0	INCREDIBLE! 10 STARS!	2003-09-09	7	6	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	David Bower	We have to force ourselves to stop watching this series; every hour leaves the viewer facing a cliff-hanger situation that compels the viewer to see how this one is resolved only to be followed by another one at the end of the next hour. To add to the cliff-hanger problem, Series 2 ends on another cliff-hanger meaning you have to watch Episode 1 of Season 3 to find out how that issue is resolved! You know the rest, having watched Episode 1 of Season 3 you're now compelled to watch Episode 2 of Season 3; it's vicious.The only problem I had at first was with Kim's free-spirited disobedience until I realized she was just like her father; they both just like to do it their way. This is an outstanding series but I warn you it is hard to stop watching and try to get something else done.Both sound and video are first rate, absolutely no problems whatsoever.Approach with great caution!	5.0	Dangerously Addictive	2012-01-31	6	5	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3GKOMCQTTWPUI	"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL"""	"I'm always amazed to see it come together. Because so many times, you're so close to it that it doesn't seem like it's going to be very good."" If you've seen even a couple of episodes of Fox's ""real time"" series 24, you likely won't be surprised to hear that Carlos Bernard, who plays Tony Almeida, has a sense of humor and humility. Still, it's entertaining to hear him yuk it up with costars Sarah Wynter (who plays hapless but incredibly gritty bystander Kate Warner) and Michelle Forbes (Presidential Assistant Lynne Kresge), as they watch the fourth episode (""11am-12pm"") for Fox's second season DVD collection.Over the 45 minutes, the three remark on one another's good or bad hair, enthuse about their camera people and writers, call star Kiefer Sutherland ""the Keifernator,"" and joke about the show's lapses into convention (""Look at this guy with his arm!"" Bernard giggles when he spots corny behavior by a victim of the explosion at CTU [Counter Terrorism Unit], at whose offices much of the show is set). From the sounds of it, they actually like working on this show.And no wonder. The series not only takes on a timely subject -- ongoing and organized terrorist threats against the U.S., this season set in L.A., where a nuclear bomb is set to explode -- but it also treats its performers with unusual care, granting them unusually lengthy onscreen minutes in which to build characters. Indeed, it is somewhat amazing,"" to borrow Bernard's term, to consider that the show commences production each season with only six or so episodes written, that the confluence of events and storylines is only imagined late in the season, that the actors don't exactly know who will survive or not; on one of the DVD set's documentaries, a casting director says she tells agents wondering about character arcs, ""If you don't die, you can come back."" Still, it does ""come together"" and make for compelling tv, and despite the Perils of Kim (Elisha Cuthbert).The new DVD set is certainly well outfitted (especially compared to the notoriously no-frills first season), with commentary tracks on six episodes (some more engaged than others), and a seventh disc with two documentaries, ""On The Button: The Destruction Of CTU"" (in which FX Coordinator Stan Blackwell dryly observes, ""You don't want too much Styrofoam flying when you do an explosion, 'cause it's so light. Nothing ruins a frame more than one piece of fluttering concrete coming down like a leaf""); and a two-part documentary, ""24 Exposed,"" about the making of the final two episodes (with a focus on the shootout and fighting between Jack and an array of feisty villains).This in addition to 49 deleted scenes and alternate takes, and the original extended version season premiere, which remains excellent, even on repeated viewing: the moment when Jack, sullen and short-tempered following his wife's murder last season, shoots that slimy suspect point blank in the chest is seriously disconcerting. As George Mason (Xander Berkley) looks on, appropriately aghast, Jack instructs him, ""That's the problem with people like you, George. You want results, but you never want to get your hands dirty... I'm gonna need a hacksaw."" (As producer Joel Surnow pronounces, ""This is a red meat show. People kill people and go eat a sandwich right after."")The season had much to live up to, given that the first was critically lauded, but took some time to gather a broad audience (this process including the repurposing of episodes on Fox's sister network, FX, such that 24 was available to view, for a few months anyway, repeatedly (though not nearly so often as the Law & Order behemoth or Seinfeld reruns, for that matter). Jack's transformation from morally upright hard worker to singular angry ex-agent is efficiently conveyed in the first episode, ""8am-9am,"" as he appears, ""inactive,"" walking away from the camera in a split screen, next to Tony walking toward the camera. Grizzled, flannel-shirted, and stalking his daughter, Jack's still suffering from the traumatic events 18 months earlier, but NSA calls him in anyway, as he's the only guy with a remote chance to respond usefully to a ""domestic terrorist alert,"" a nuclear device timed to go off within 24 hours. Of course he's the only guy. He's Jack Bauer.The ""domestic"" aspect of this terror always works across boundaries in 24 -- the private and public domains are continually collapsing here. As Forbes notes, ""Read it on paper, and you expect it to be like heightened melodrama,"" but, between Jack's job at CTU (however reluctantly he returns to it) and the extraordinary/daily crises faced by President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), the series neatly inserts imminent, global catastrophes. As Forbes notes, the directors work this line repeatedly and unusually, for television: ""Here,"" she says, ""they let the camera rest on all of these characters' faces, and they let their eyes speak what isn't being said."" It's a productive way to exploit tv close-ups, as well as these particular actors, all great faces. (As director Jon Cassar puts it during his commentary, ""It's all about the faces, the looks, the raised eyebrows. We don't need the visual eye candy that other shows have"").This season's plot, as Sutherland notes in ""24 Exposed,"" runs more or less (and often uncomfortably) parallel to current headlines, except, as the politically outspoken Sutherland offers, ""Our show is about trying to stop a war; our country, unfortunately, is at war."" During shooting (much of it in Toronto), cast and crew were only too aware of these correspondences (""It was just hitting a little too close to home,"" says Forbes), and the series made its own (sometimes subtle, sometimes not) assessments of the wrong-headedness of U.S. administration policies.Such assessments are most plainly realized in the terrorist plot, in which Second Wave, a group ""officially not recognized by any of the Middle Eastern States,"" threatens to explode a bomb in downtown L.A. This sucks in everyone at the office, including Paula (Sara Gilbert, who is terrific) and Michelle (equally sharp Reiko Aylesworth), who brilliantly juggles her part in the ticking bomb plot, her daughterish relation to George, and her growing attraction to self-interested Tony.The series also handles politics in a slightly offset way, for instance, in the supposed wedding between pert Marie Warner (Laura Harris, currently making charming trouble in Dead Like Me) and Reza Naiyeer (Phillip Rhys), the latter introduced speaking Arabic on his cell while speeding along in his red convertible, that is, just asking to be profiled by viewers, up until the point that he walks up behind his fianc&eacute;e accompanied by vaguely menacing music. Wynter says in her commentary, ""I think it was really gutsy for [the terrorist] to turn out not to be [Reza], but my very white, very blond, very privileged, very cheerleading kind of sister."" (At which point Bernard adds, if only he knew she was a cheerleader, Tony ""woulda been mackin' on her."")Other commentaries include the one over ""3-4am,"" by Sutherland and Surnow, which solicits my favorite comment of the whole package, from Sutherland: watching a series of images sans Jack: ""When I look at these scenes, it's just other people, other people, other people, just waiting for Jack"" (he hurries to declare this a joke, in case you're wondering). Another commentary, for ""1pm-2pm,"" features Cassar (who directed 10 episodes this year) and Sarah Clarke, who plays Nina (to file under gossipy trivia, she is recently married to the terrific Xander Berkley, whom she met on last year's set). Like everyone else, they discuss their affection for the series structure (Clarke likes ""the constant storylines coming at you"") as well as the episode in which Jack first confronts Nina (murderer of his wife), specifically, the smart use of surveillance monitors and window or doorframes to mark the tension and confusion caused by her re-appearance at CTU. ""It's like two fighters,"" Clarke says, watching Jack and Nina square off in a sequence of unnerving close-ups, ""Round after round.""The season's other brilliant return belongs to Sheri (Penny Johnson Jerald), with machinations as sinister as before. This complex, powerful woman can do anything, it's clear, the ethical and emotional arrangements in her own mind are always breathtakingly focused on her relationship to that man she loves. At the same time, Sheri is part of the show's commitment to intelligent and politicized casting; watching a scene with characters of color, Johnson Jerald notes during her commentary track, ""This is the beauty of 24 here, in terms of casting. I enjoy it when I see people who look like me and look like other people and represent the full spectrum of people, without making a big deal out of it.""Definitely less well rounded, much like last season, Kim's annoying storyline stumbles from calamity to calamity. Again, she's caught up in serial dangers, so that her box is always about to break out into chaos: dashing about in her tight little top, she's always in dire need of Jack's help (that said, she does eventually come into her own, and proves wholly capable of the sort of ""red meat"" violence for which her father is infamous). Still, she tends to distract him from whatever latest international fire he's forced to put out (as Johnson Jerald says, ""Look at the difference between Dennis and Kiefer, just in terms of the manly look. You have this clean-cut, very Presidential man with power, and then this rugged look of this man who's going to save the day). Working as a nanny for a little girl whose father is abusing her, Kim escapes with the help of her gorgeous beau Miguel (pop star Innis Casey), runs right into the arms of hard-charging head case Kevin Dillon, then has to deal with the apparent fact that her father is playing Slim Pickens on a nuclear warhead. Again, he's the only guy. He's Jack Bauer.As Jack careens from mishap to tragedy, he's set off against the President, who behaves in the noblest manner imaginable, no matter what disasters head his way. Haysbert describes his performance this way: ""I live in a world where there are no accidents."" It's an apt way of looking at the responsibility Palmer shoulders (Haysbert says he models the character on Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Colin Powell, and does his best, even off set, to seem a role model; ""My personal belief,"" he says in his incredible voice, ""Is that I have to maintain a certain footing.""Leave it to Sheri to see though this gallant posture, as when she confronts Jack with his own only guyness, his lonely absolutism, in the final episode, ""7-8am."" ""You're a very impressive man, Jack, but you see everything as either good or bad, just like David. And the world is so much more complicated than that."" 24 appreciates these complications, even if it might wish Jack is right. It reveals dangers from within the U.S. administration (emerging from corruption and ineptitude equally), from within the perfect Southern Californian family, from within those ""corporate interests"" propped up by government policies. It also gives you a hero, but he's mad about it."	5.0	24 Season 2 (DVD)	2006-02-13	5	4	1

For ages afterward something was bothering me about this series and when I figured out what it was it made me a happy man, so I'd like to share it with the community. It's this: Kim. Yes she's perky, yes she's wholesome, but she also happens to be every Friday the 13th rolled into one. I mean, accused of murder and kidnapping, involved in a near-fatal car crash and a gas-station siege and then held hostage by a millenial wack-job, all on a day when her father specifically told her to stay out of trouble? The cougar was just the icing. What I did when I figured this out was, I went back and watched the whole thing again, skipping right past all the Kim-related tomfoolery - it was way shorter and roughly about a million times better, trust me, try it out.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1VW4ZBXKEYTZ9	DaytonaDan	The first season of this series was pretty tame compared to later sessions since Jack spent way too much time wringing his hands over his repeatedly kidnapped family. With season 2, we finally get to see Jack in full hard a** mode. He kills people at the drop of a hat and even (spoiler alert) chops off the head of one of them and carries it around in a gym bag to advance his goals. He also attains somewhat ridiculous but enduring superman powers, surviving plenty of near death and yes (spoiler alert) even full death experiences with out much damage. OK. Not very likely. It's even silly at times. But overall,  it's entertaining. Far more entertaining than the first season. Newbies might just want to skip the first season entirely and start here. But lots of lingering characters from season 1 might make it little confusing. The only downside to this season is strangely weak finale. And a cliffhanger ending that is largely meaningless since it is only tangentially related to what happens in season 3.	4.0	the REAL Jack Bauer's first appearance	2013-05-14	0	0	0

Next, the events of Jack's daughter are downright stupid, as in the first year, but worse.  Next, the events that follow throughout the story seem really unbelievable.  Now, I know that the idea is to take an event and spread it out over a 24 episode year, and the event takes place in 24 hours, so maybe it's hard to write a good sequence of events that will hold people's interest over a season or watching TV, but still.  I haven't watched later seasons as I didn't watch this when it was on TV, but I hope they get better after this one.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3S7WU6DIH71CC	Denny Vu Quach	I was always skeptical about 24 going into a second season. It ended near perfectly at the end of the first season. Buy when I checked out season two, I was hooked all over again. Not only is the season more interesting, it involves issues that our world is currently dealing with. Not only that, but the action has been pumped up 400%, that acting keeps getting better, and Jack (Keifer Sutherland) is one of the best characters to follow on TV.With the finale just around the corner, and a new third season on the way, I think it is safe to say this DVD is a perfect buy for any fan of the show, or anybody who missed its initial run and wants to see what all the hype is about. Surely it will have many more special features than season 1 did, since the first season DVD was produced and created in about 2 months. Most likely as well as the stuff season one's had, like preview for season three, and quite possibly an alernate ending. Hopefully they will put in some commentaries in the mix as well.But anyway.....Fox is doing a great job with their TV on DVD lately. They started off slow, but with sales growing and growing, they are picking up the pace, and seem to be producing better quality DVD's.Now I just need to wait for the rest of Angel, The Shield, Farscape, The Dead Zone, and The Simpsons to be released.....	5.0	:::24::: The Best Thing on TV!	2004-04-12	6	5	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3723UCZLHHZF2	"Diana J. Larson ""learner"""	I enjoyed season 1 and anticipated watching season 2. Season 1 did have violence and cruelty, but it was mostly suggested, not shown in a graphic manner.  Season 2, however, opens by showing severe torturing of a man to get information, showing the method and how much pain he was in.  It was disturbing.  Most people I now would rather see the suggestion of cruelty, which makes a story more suspenseful, but being graphic takes away from suspense and make it in bad taste.  I do not plan to watch anymore of 24 due to this new aspect of an otherwise well written, and well acted series.	2.0	sadistic	2013-05-14	2	1	1

We like it a lot.  Season 2 moves along at a fast pace and every episode does a great job of resolving the prior episode's cliffhanger ending and building to its own.  One storyline in the show - the one involving Jack's daughter Kim - has turned out not so great.  Talk about someone with bad luck and poor judgment!  On top of that, almost everyone she meets has an evil streak.  Having said that, even those segments with her are still fun to watch.All in all a great show to sit down with and do some serious binge watching!

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	Season Two is the true test of this show's mettle.  Can 24 sustain itself now that the novelty of its groundbreaking real-time conceit has worn off?The answer is yes.  24's writers and producers are smart enough to know that it wasn't so much the real-time aspect which connected with people, but the array of insurmountable obstacles and impossible odds with which Jack Bauer is faced episode after episode, as befits a good suspense thriller.Season Two's nuclear-bomb plot is much more ambitious than Season One.  And yes, there comes a point in the middle where the action lapses quite badly, when the threat of detonation diminishes.  And the show underutilizes Jack's character for a good four, five episodes -- a mistake.  It's Kiefer Sutherland's edgy, aggressive portrayal of this dogged, often morally questionable character that anchors the tone of the show, and the first quarter of the show has far too much Kate Warner (Sarah Wynter) and not enough jack Bauer.The Kate Warner subplot, while a good one in conception, goes awry in execution for a good 50 per cent of the show.  Sarah Wynter does an adequate job, but every single character in this subplot remains paper-thin up until the midpoint of the season.  It's like the gooey family love-in in Season One without the physical danger.  Since the characters have no weight (Laura Harris as Marie Warner is especially irritating), their fussy interactions also ring hollow, especially ranked alongside Jack's apocalyptic nuclear threat and even the Kim Bauer kidnapping subplot.  Once Kate and Jack meet and she is incorporated into the conspiracy through-line, she becomes a much better character and Wynter's appeal comes through.Sutherland remains the center of everything, befittingly.  The loss of Sarah Clarke in the main cast does hurt; Reiko Aylesworth does a fine job as replacement Michelle Dessler, but she just doesn't have Clarke's arresting presence.  Fans of Season One looking for closure in the Nina Myers subplot can stop looking -- Season Two gives Clarke a wonderful opportunity to chew scenery and play an insidious villainess and Clarke is terrific in this role, but don't expect any attempt to explain just how Nina Myers went from saintly sidekick to vicious double agent.  Elisha Cuthbert continues to impress with acting nuances uncommon among actresses her age; she's a pro at making interesting choices at emotional moments.  Dennis Haysbert is stately and subtly powerful as President Palmer, and happily, Penny Johnson Jerald as Sherry Palmer is given a more human dimension in the scripts, rather than the blindly destructive saboteur of Season One, and Jerald rises to the occasion.  The best performance of the season, however, belongs to Xander Berkeley.  Finally this fine actor is given a character arc worthy of his abilities, and Berkeley's portrayal of George Mason's metamorphosis is emotionally devastating, while retaining the character's defining irreverence and scuzziness.  I wonder why he was locked out of the Emmys?Suffice to say that I stayed up for another 20 hours straight watching this thing.  This show has a hypnotic quality not found in any other, and you can bet I'll be first in line for Season Three -- especially since Season Two ends on the mother of all cliffhangers.  I just hope the writers can keep this up.	5.0	Less kinetic than Season One, but still highly gripping.	2003-09-21	72	64	8

Some say it's predictable, but I can't imagine where they're coming from.  Major characters aren't safe, no matter how important they are to the show (save Jack that is).  Plot twists come fast and heavy.  Is there any wonder why the show was so immensely popular?  If you've never watched, all I can say is, &#34;Buckle your seat belts.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A35PF4XXTB5A8H	Don Cheeto	......the first time I was exposed to 24 was during the season premiere of Season Five. I was at a friends house and he was flipping through the channels and this was on. I loved the show from then on, but knew I would have to get caught up to know what was going on. I never watched an episode again for a long time (because I always worked when it was on). Recently one of my friends was telling me how great a show 24 is, and a store had the Seasons 1-4 on sale for $16, so I decided, why the hell not. I bought Seasons 1-3, then four and now 5. This is by far the best TV show I have ever watched. You will litteraly get hooked on it, as you will want to know what is going to happen next. It's full of plot twists and will not put you to sleep, it is very good. Although Season 2 was not as superb as the first one, it was still outstanding. This one is about a nuclear bomb that is set to go off in Los Angeles. The only thing I did not like was the last four episodes there were times when it seemed something could go wrong, and it did times five!!! Other than that it was great. I would give it 4.5 stars.  Now I'm off to Season 3!!!	4.0	WOW this blew me away...	2006-12-08	1	1	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A13BP4NJEBZGEY	"Drew Macevenwick ""sanmarnan"""	******This review is for those who have already seen Season One. If you are not among that crowd, watch that season before you even think about watching this one********24's second season find's Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) ready for another day that's bad beyond my ability to convey. When we first catch up with Jack, we find him no longer employed at CTU, and alienated from his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), who's recently begun caring for an abused child with a psychopathic father. Jack is quickly called back to work when President Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) and his aides learn there is a nuclear bomb somewhere in L.A. set to go off that very day. Palmer, himself, is forced to deal with a possible conspiracy against him, and the return of his not-so-pleasant ex-wife, Sherry (Penny Johnson-Jerald). George Mason (Xander Berkeley) now heads CTU, with Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) working just under him, as well as several new faces. Meanwhile, Kate Warner (Sarah Wynter) suspects her sister's husband-to-be may be involved with terrorists.24's second season features just as much action and suspense as season one, and even improves upon the previous season in some respects. The entire season seems to have been planned in advance this time around, so almost all of the plot developments fit together nicely and make perfect sense. Some of these twists will surprise the hell out of you, and even the ones that won't will please because the show is well-written and well-acted.The only thing that keeps these episodes from earning five stars is Kim Bauer's plot line, which is like an extended bad dream. Whereas all of the other plots come together, Kim just seems to be in the mix because the writers/producers wanted to keep the character around. The scenes involving Kim (with the notable exception of one involving a disturbing phone call from her father) all distract more than anything else. This is not to say it was in any way actress Elisha Cuthbert's fault-the writers simply should have found a way to work her into the plot better. As it is, a series of unbelievable mini-disasters happen to Kim.Still, her role is thankfully kept to a minimum and won't ruin an otherwise A+ television series. This DVD package is also significantly better than the one for Season one. It features chapters, commentaries, and several featurettes. Don't miss out on this excellent DVD.	4.0	An excellent follow-up to a great debut season	2004-05-03	4	3	1

Well I'm on to something else.I made it through the first season, barely and three eps of season two and I'm done.  There is always a minion who does the opposite of what the president wants,  the female minion who can't speak up for herself, the stupid daughter who doesn't listen and makes bad decisions (like getting out of the car instead of driving over the bad daddy), and the Jack Bauer cowboy solutions that make it worse  and then worse again before it gets better.  At least they killed the wife off at the end of season 1.  Should have killed the daughter too.  Who writes such annoyingly stupid women?  Of course half of the episodes would be missing without their inane actions.For anyone wanting REALLY good domestic spy action, check out Spooks from the UK.  IT was slick and action-packed and incredibly well acted and written with the added bonus that you never knew who would get killed off.  Or if more action is for you, better to watch Strike Back, also mostly British about an SAS team operating in various international locales.  24, in contrast is formulaic and repetitive, filled with cliche characters and did I say repetitive?  I repeat......	2.0	Repetitive formula that doesn't engage	2014-06-03	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3LRKDF5WU4ZDO	"E. Carter ""The Marching Bugler"""	I see now why this show has such a wide appeal.  Right wingers love it for its politically incorrect portrayal of Islamic terrorist attacks and the Muslim sleeper cells who would carry them out.  Left wingers love it for its politically correct portrayal of the terrorist attacks being financed by money hungry oil barons conspiring to start a war in the Middle East to maximize their profits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah - I get it.  Anyway, it still has clever plot twists and plenty of entertainment value.  As for the DVD, when you select an episode, it takes about four seconds to access that episode. Then, you can't look at the picture that goes with each episode or else it gives you a spoiler about what will happen in that episode.  If you want suspense, you have to somehow obscure your view of the right half of the screen (where the picture is) until you press the play button.  And you better not read the episode summaries in the booklet in advance either; they provide way too much information.	3.0	It's right wing, it's left wing, it's even got conspiracy theories	2007-12-22	4	4	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1DJ2PL5J04AWV	"Ernest Dowson ""EDowson"""	"The second season of 24 descends into the ridiculous, and is likely to cause the educated viewer a substantial amount of physical pain.  President Palmer, depicted in season 1 as a man of insight and wisdom, looks much like a petulant, overgrown child in the second season.  His erstwhile wife, Sherry, is much worse.  She has to be the most annoying figure in the entire history of television.  The series' writers have a quaint proclivity for toying with the viewers; that's fine.  But it becomes boresome when EVERY sympathetic character turns out to be a villain (and/or is killed off) and EVERY annoying witch proves actually to be an admirable, self-sacrificing heroine.24 is completely divorced from reality.  No sane President would allow his wife--let alone his ex-wife--such control over his staff as President Palmer grants Sherry in Season 2.  Even Ms. Clinton had the courtesy to keep her influence a trifle more muted during the BJ Clinton administration.  And then there's the laughable scene from the mosque, where a burqa'd Kate lingers in the mens' prayer area for an interminable amount of time without any consequences.  Have 24's producers ever visited an actual fundamentalist mosque?  In many of them, the women's areas are architecturally separated from those of the men.  24 has gone out of its way to depict modern Islamism in a way that is palatable to a Western public.  Even the arch-terrorist, Syed Ali, and his colleagues hardly represent convincing Islamist terrorists, but rather weepy-eyed sentimentalists whose religous hatred for the US is softened by acts of kindness on the part of their intended victims.Just as ludicrous is the manner in which 24 treats the issue of ""torture.""  Domestic and international outcry has been levelled at the United States because two or three eighteen-year-old soldiers put panties on the heads of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, and even more vehement accusations are made against the US for policies pertaining to Guantanamo Bay, where prisoners are given prayer rugs, halal meals, exercise times, etc., etc.  Yet 24's heroes assault their prisoners and harm them in excruciating ways, often with Presidential approval, in a way that potentially glorifies such methods of torture, even though not a single demonstrable instance of such behavior exists in the entire war on terror and the same people who love the TV series would bellyache incessantly if the Bush Administration were to sanction such tactics.  (Actually, the bellyaching proceeds in the absence of any sanction.)24 is mildly entertaining but does not serve even remotely in instructing its viewers on what Islamist terror really represents.  It does a disservice to its audience not only through its abysmal dialogue, but also by implying that domestic ""terror"" groups are just as much a threat as Islamist terrorism.  24 is as close to al Qaeda propaganda as we're likely to get on US television."	2.0	Fast forward through all scenes with the President	2006-06-28	18	7	11

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2YD82EQQ1SO4Q	Eugene A. Banks	"As with any show, that becomes an addiction ... there is that sense of suspicion about the 2nd season meeting the same level as the first.  For the most part, you can toss these concerns aside and dive into the Bauer chronicles.  In a 1st season review, I said and will re-iterate here, it has taken a good 15 years of channel surfing to finally find a fantastic and innovative series I can admire.As to the 2nd season, it is replete with great moments.  I love to figure out what is happening during every episode, and when I think I have it ... I go down in flames.  I guess wrong.  And I love that.  Imagine entertainment has daisy chained perfect foils.  Be surprised. Each episode keeps you hooked and Tuesdays don't come soon enough.The only problem I have is Kim's interruptions.  And from the grapevine, I hear she will be entering a lesbian relationship and doesn't want to tell Jack, her father, in the 3rd season.  Why?  What's intense and heart pounding about THAT!  I want NSA, NOT social/cultural/soap box commentary. Several of my friends do not like the Kim's character, and her situations are totally goofed up writing.  Not at all believeable, and seem to be an afterthought.  It's like Palmer's son never appearing in the 2nd season.  Thank you for delivering me from that pain.  Do the same with Kim, I'm begging here.Putting her aside, I can honestly say: Watch It!  The discussions Wed. AM at work are the best. AND buy the DVD's.  I see the 2nd season will have ""extras.""

Even when it's not necessarily my personal favorite, I think that it's objectively the best.The reason is that it has so much in common with the stock blockbuster disaster thriller (e.g., Armageddon, Independence Day), namely in the way it goes from all these disparate groups of people who are brought together by the potential disastrous event; and it also is the most, as it were, ""Clancyesque"" of the seasons.  I always note how most action movies start right here, where the ex-agent has suffered some great loss before now, which is alluded to but we do not actually see -- yet in the case of 24, we have seen it, and thus does Day1 function as a sort of prequel -- and is the reason why he retired, yet he is called back in For This One Assignment, because no one else can.  And Jack Bauer's role in this is just so much more ""Leader of the Pack"" rather than his later adventures, which often remind me of Die Hard (viz., after Day3) -- not that they are worse or better on that account (I love Die Hard(s)), but just different.I've also noticed that Sean Callery's music, something about the way he arranges it in this particular season, is way more intense than most seasons.

The daughter running into a series of impossible situations.  Other characters thrown into situations that are a bit far-fetched.  I understand it's entertainment, but by the end of this season it's agonizing to see roadblocks put in front of the characters in a repetitious fashion.  It becomes so predictable that you know what's going to happen before it does.

If you like suspense, action, and drama even to the slightest degee, buy this set and prepare to be glued to the TV.The first season of '24' was something different and new. There had never been anything like it on television before, and the season was as much about experimentation as it was entertainment. How to keep the action up hour to hour, how to make it all 'real time', what should happen when, how to resolve it all in 24 hours...At the end of the year, it proved to be a learning experience. Some things worked, some didn't. But the idea of another season was tricky from the get go. How can you rework the magic without falling in the same traps? How can you make the storyline more suspenseful (the first is hard to beat)? How do you explain what happened in the break from season 1 to 2 in an hour of real time? Fans had a lot to worry about that long summer. But November finally rolled around and old and new fans switched their sets on for what would be the first episode of an incredible year of TV.But the second time around, the creators were all set and ready to go. Gone was the write-as-you-go style, the odd pacing, and the impossible scenarios. Everything was planned...hour by hour the pieces of the puzzle slowly fit into another...the plot growing larger. The intricacy of it all was amazing. The shocks were all inserted perfectly and at the right time, the action was well-paced, and the acting was better.Season two learned from season one's mistakes, and proved to be a defining year in TV.New fans were coming everyday to the Fox forum for the show. Spoilers were popping up everywhere. Ratings climbed.Placing the show after ""American Idol"" certainly helped the ratings.In the end, by the time the finale was aired in May, fans had become addicts to this adrenaline-pumping show.When waiting 3 weeks for the new episode was hard, waiting months on end for the new season seemed harder.We're still waiting. But for those of you wondering if this is all hype or if you should just save a few bucks...don't. You can hardly consider buying this set a waste of money. In fact, if you like suspense and action, it's as essential as food.Pop in the disc and see what fans have been raving about, and remember we had to wait a week or sometimes 3 between those episodes!Turn on and enjoy.The only thing you have to lose is sleep because you won't be able to turn the damn thing off."	5.0	Just buy it.	2003-07-15	9	6	3
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3G3ETDYILLTGL	Gary f Burke	The show was okay but after the nuclear bomb dilemma they are kind of dragging it out with preventing the war,and Jack Bauer is a little bit of an unbelievable character. But it has me intrigued and I will continue watching it.  I'm on season two and I have a long way to go.	3.0	24 season 2	2014-04-13	0	0	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3DJSWCMTD6HZG	"Gary Gagliardi ""Award-Winning Strategy Author..."	The subplot involving the daughter seems (at least though first third of series) completely gratuitous, having nothing to do with the main issues and a complete coincidence to give the character, established in the first series, a problem to deal with. Considering the gravity of the main plot, everyone's actions seem too motivated by personal history than a sense of perspectice.	3.0	Not as good as first season, but still interesting	2013-09-19	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1RJJ56MBJMX87	Gavin Wilson	Right from the first scene in the first episode, you know there is going to be a lot of lingering suffering in this series. But this is pre-Abu Graib, when the US government thought that torture (and extraordinary rendition) was a justifiable way of averting calamity. The producers of 24 take up this theme with a vengeance, and Jack Bauer dies at least once in this story, although you know that he gets resurrected, otherwise there couldn't be a series 3, 4 and 5, could there?The story is better than the first series in the sense that it is one continuous plot. (Series One suffers from a big change of story, pace and production team after episode #14.) But in order to keep Kimberley Bauer in the story, she is subjected to a series of adventures almost wholly unrelated to the main nuclear-bomb story yet which happen coincidentally on the same day. The girl she looks after is incredibly annoying, by the way. But if you want to target a teenage audience, I guess you have to have some teenage characters.There are some highly unlikely turnarounds during this 24-hour period. A president gets replaced then reinstated. His ex-wife worms her way back into his bunker, then gets expelled, then becomes a virtual heroine. The top baddies seem perfectly happy to switch their plans at the last moment from a start-a-Middle-Eastern-war strategy to an assassinate-the-president plan. The aspect that perhaps the director does best is the no-sex relationship developments. Tony and Michelle look early on as if they're going to get it together, but by the end, they both know they're too damned tired. And Jack and the woman he rescues develop an understanding, without any need to hop into bed before the day is out. (James Bond would have had at least three lovelies by this stage.)I'm not happy about seeing actors in pain, and I'd frankly much rather see them in bed, but I guess torture is unfortunately a fundamental part of this plot. Shame!	5.0	If in doubt, throw in another torture scene	2006-09-13	3	1	2

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	As a general rule, I don't watch drama on television.  In the last few months, I've picked up a few shows, but in the 5 years previous to that there wasn't a single drama that I watched with any regularity.  (This would be dating back to when the 'X-Files' went to hell, and when I determined that 'Millenium' was too goddamn depressing.)  Well actually, I still haven't ever watched '24' on TV, just the DVD's, and I don't really know if I'd have all that much patience for just watching a single episode a week.  But, suffice to say, watching it on DVD is damn fun.  Yeah, yeah, this show is ridiculously implausible, and the flashy style rarely adds anything to it, but it makes you watch more.  So, it works.Entertaining though season 1 was, season 2 is a vast improvement.  Season 1 tended to be extremely unfocused and meandering, whereas season 2 is much more tightly plotted.  And, it also earns points for being willing to do things that you wouldn't anticipate. (i.e. kill important characters)  A few of the plot twists are kinda obnoxiously ludicrous, but this sorta thing is only a passing annoyance, and comes with the territory.  Performances are generally very strong, with the notable exception of Elisha Cuthbert, who's pretty ehh.  But, she's real purty, so I forgive her.  Special note goes to Kiefer Sutherland, mainly because he pretty much pulls off the whole badass image he's trying to create here, despite the fact that he's more naturally inclined to be a dork.  And, although it's much more about tension and plot, some of the action scenes are reasonably well choreographed, which is pretty much unheard of on TV.Hmm, I guess that's it.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A25P9KMA413HYH	"Greg Zimmerman ""9-11"""	"Season 2 of ""24"" takes place right where season one left off. Dealing with the tragic death of his wife, Jack Bauer isknow confronted with more terrible news that sets up another plot for a 24 hour race against the clock. Unlike in itsdebut season, the story line for the second year  doesn't take a long progress. Its action is seen immediately and  itsimpact is dominate. Alarmed that Los Angeles is under  a terrorist's threat, Bauer is now assigned the mission tostop a nuclear bomb planted in the city of angels.Season 2  follows the same formula that made its debut season worthy of viewing.  The characters are intact  and  even showcase symptoms of true heroism. Sarah Wynter's addition to the cast was magnificent. Her portrayal of  Kate Warner displayed the depth with tolerance of being both a proud daughter and a sister to a deranged lunatic. Elisha Cuthbert's, ""Kim Bauer"" once again proved failure got the best of her in real time. It's funny though, I can't think of anyone who could characterize her any better then Cuthbert. She really strikes a chord with her dispositions.Season 2 of ""24""  does lack emotional profundity that made the first season so unique. However, honoring the whole concept of the show makes its immense strength greater. ""24"" is at its premium best when the intense action overthrows the indulgent family disputes that the first season strongly exhibited.  It's also extraordinary to note that the writers never fail to deliver its charge of rapid resistance  and vital suspense.The season 2 box set is filled heavily. What's so great about this set, is its use to trace certain deleted scenes fromeach episode and place them into the scene it was originally taken out of.  The box set also includes several  commentaries and plenty of behind the scenes footage. Season 2 isn't the definitive season to date but sure implies hours or nonstop viewing. Lets just hope that this show can still deliver for seasons to come."	4.0	Great Season,  Great DVD SET	2004-05-29	4	2	2

What is motiviating the coup d'etat in the White House? Like ""The Sopranos,"" ""24"" unfolds like a brilliant novel--you can't wait to get to the next chapter. With sharp writing (Kim Bauer aside) that unfolds brilliant twists and one shocking finale after another, I can't remember liking television so much. Can't wait for the release of this season...hopefully it will hold me until the premiere of Season Three. If you haven't seen Season One, which is uniformly excellent, you should really start there.

Yes there were implausible things and other stuff that was stupid but for the most part it was entertaining.After those 18 episodes the plot shifts from the ""bomb"" to a government conspiracy wanting to impeach President Palmer and attack the middle eastern countries. Everything about this plot was stupid and implausible. It was so frustrating to watch I can't even put it into words.My opinion is skip this season all together. The funny thing is, they duplicate this exact plot in season 6, like literally it's the exact same thing that happens to David Palmer's brother. This season is an example of an over the top plot that goes in a bunch of different directions.Most annoying things about this season:Palmer conspiracy plotKim Bauer's plotsCarrie CTU agent"	2.0	Started out well, ending up being complete crap	2012-02-15	2	2	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3G8HKRFW1UZCK	"Hung Yu Ting ""Moustache"""	Season 2 of 24 as exciting as the 1st, with numerous twists and turns and edge of your seat finales.  But unlike season 1 one where everything seemed to interlock with precision, the writing in the second season falls much shorter, both in content quality and believability.The Kim Bauer sequences seem tacked on and totally unnecessary.  Her scenes amount to nothing more than filler.  The actress and her supporting actors are fine; it's the writing that is predictable and uninteresting.Also, the general plot arc seemed to lead up to the bomb.  The bomb and its countdown should have gone on to the end of the season.  Having it as a mid-story Act Change was ok, but the post-bomb episodes lagged, as well as the fact that replacing a president 6 hours after a nuke goes off is pretty much a straight coup d'etat.  None of the politicians in the meeting at the end ever even brought that up.  How could you come out to the public the next day and say you de-seated the president in a private meeting 5 hours after the bomb went off?Other things stretch the lines of believability:1)After CTU is bombed, a governmental installation, it seems as if it's not a newsworthy event.  No agent ever mentions a media circus outside the blast area, no one speaks of or to the press, etc. The viewer is in on the nuke, but according to the story, the people and press aren't.  How is it then that a bombing at CTU didn't become the international news story that it would become it something like that really happened?2) how many times can a person be about to be shot and the gun goes off, but surprise!  it was Jack Bauer to save the day (or whoever else) and the person that got shot was the one who was going to shoot you.  It happened enough that I noticed.  After the Warner daughter got it, I thought, how many times can you dip into that bag?But all in all, still a good season.  Very watchable and fun.  Great action, suspense, and touching on some themes still relevant as this never-ending War on Terror plods along.  Now if they can only find some sort of soap operatic way to bring back George Mason.  He was top shelf.  Bummer he had to go.	3.0	slick as season 1, but writing far less impressive	2010-06-06	2	2	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3D5UHUD1CMTXG	"Jacki ""Jack Mueller"""	Jack Bauer is reeling from the death of his wife and his estrangemnet from his daughter. But his mourning is put on hold when The President of The United States reactivates him as an agent for the Las Angelos Counter Terrorist Unit. Bauer learns of a nuclear threat against the city and that one of his old covers will lead him to those who are first implicated. Except once assuming his old cover, Bauer discovers that there is someone more powerful behind the detination of the nuclear bomb. And the clock is ticking....This time around, Kiefer Sutherland not only assumes the role of Jack Bauer, but also as the show's co-executive producer. It is quite an impact on this season. Sutherland's character is not as essential as it was in the previous year. There are numerous sub-stroylines with countless characters, and they take away the focus of the main story. Kim Bauer is even more of an airhead in this season, and she really did not even have to be in the story. She is just there to take up time. There are other characters that do this, but not nearly as bad as Kim Bauer. The real problem with this season, is that the writers tried to out-do the previous year with more conflicts for the characters. This does not work so well, for the issues arise and are soon dropped with no true relevance to the main story. This causes the show to loose its feel of a film, even with it still in Real-Time Format. This season really feels more like an episodic story. 24 SEASON TWO is intriguing, but not even close to being as good as its previous year.	4.0	DAY 2: Nuclear Threat	2006-07-10	4	4	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A39LM9AFFKAWRA	Jack Sears	An all-star cast returns in FOX's poweful drama 24. Once again Kiefer Sutherland picks up the roll as Jack Bauer, a former federal agent for the governmnet's Counter Terrorist Unit. He also takes the roll as executive producer for the television show, and it's downhill from there. Viewers who are watching the show for the first time will be on the edge of their seats, as season two gives them the feeling of watching a great show on television. Fans will be very disappointed in the delivery of this season's storyline, for it doesn't give the feeling of viewing a long but very good movie as the first season did. The story of a rouge nuclear weapon on American soil would have been a good one, if the writers had known where they were going with it. Characters were introduced and dropped in the nezt two episodes, such as Sarah Clarke's Nina Myers. Elisha Cuthbert's character Kim Bauer makes stupid and unneeded mistakes that were just used to keep the show interesting and to have a pretty woman in it. The acting, editing, musical score is fantastic unlike the show itself. After seeing this and the first season, it feels as if the writers tried to out match the previous season with its assasination story but fall far from it.	4.0	Season Two Falls Far from the Original	2003-08-31	8	5	3

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	Twenty-four hours of television for one series, with advertising, slightly shorter without, thanks God. The series is a perfect thrilling adventure and till the last minute we do not know the end, and I won't tell it. The situation is political and it explores, under G.W. Bush, what should be done, hence should have been done after 9/11, in the case of a  nuclear international crisis, what's more a nuclear attack on the US territory. First the President is black and the vice-president is white. The president divorced his wife and she hates it and wants his head. That makes the plot very thick if not frankly sick. A nuclear bomb is smuggled into the US and will eventually explode though not in the midst of Los Angeles as initially planned. A tape is delivered that seems to prove a meeting took place in Cyprus between the representatives of three Middle East states and a terrorist organization. The President organizes the response, including a military immediate strike against the three countries concerned by the tape. The tape is validated by all services, though one agent of the main security agency has doubts and events little by little convince him that the tape is a fake. The President trusts him and thus keepts the military action going but stops the final strike that will have to wait for the result of Jack Bauer's research and mission.  The whole series is very good because the story line is systematically disturbed and warped by new elements making the target evasive. The warmonger is the Vice President, an allusion to Cheney, and the main argument is that military action cannot be decided on the basis of any information or evidence if there is a doubt about it. Any doubt must freeze the action and dynamize the work of all security services to explore that doubt. The twenty-fifth amendment to the US Constitution is largely used in the last hours of this day and it shows some are ready to use it to block a debate or even an investigation in order to make a military decision, which is apolitical decision, inescapable. The series does not try to really discuss the validity of the procedure but shows how in some circumstances the amendment can be manipulated by some to side-track the President himself. In other words the series shows us that the very Constitution of the US contains some loops that could be used by a clan to impose their power. At the same time the series tries to reassure us about such situations that are exceptional and in a way negotiable.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID	5.0	High Treason knows many ways	2010-04-30	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1AD902V2W1XK3	Jake	I'll admitt: This second season of &quot;24&quot; isn't *as* good as the first, but it is still splendid, intense, and emotional. There are a few badly written scenes, and Kim's storyline is almost proposterous throughout the [year]/day (yet at times, she is interesting to watch).There are many new and interesting characters. The Warners, especially Kate, unfold to their &quot;destiny&quot; beautifully. Many of the characters though are written off to soon. (Now that I bring this to your attention, you'll notice it too if you decide to watch it.) In some aspects, this second season IS EVEN BETTER. But then I think of the first year, and the events that occured were traumatic and heart-breaking.If you're looking for something to preoccupy your time with something better than ALL TV SHOWS AND MOST MOVIES, &quot;24&quot; is your answer&quot;. If you're not looking to waste some time, make some. Watch &quot;24&quot;.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1DIL5N1WOPI7G	James A Sappington	Jack Bauer is certainly a man's man. This guy can survive gunshots and heart attacks with no discernible decrease in performance. All in a day's work, I guess. I suspect between seasons he just hibernates to heal up. Even more amazing is his daughter. She goes through more trauma in one day than most soldiers do on tour in Afghanistan. And still no evidence of PTSD. And no evidence she got any smarter since the last episode. If Ozzie and Harriet exemplified the &#34;hyper-real&#34; family stereotype, 24 exemplifies the effects of playing Call of Duty once the fetus develops thumbs. Exciting to watch.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2Z2MUZ76N5EY7	James E. Carroll	I came late to the party. I did not see a single episode of 24 until this past season (4th). Now, I have purchased all three seasons on DVD and I am hooked! This show is destined to be an instant classic; it has great writing, great acting, good story lines and an eery realistic feeling. Kiefer Sutherland's character, Jack Bauer, is America's best counter-terrorism agent; and thank god for him. We could all sleep better at night if there was a real Jack Bauer working for the USA. Move over James Bond, the name is Bauer, Jack Bauer.For those of you who don't know much about 24, it is a series that occurs over a period of 24 hours for the full season; each episode represents one hour.  It is a story about the USA's counter-terrorism unit based in LA that is faced with terrorist plots, bombings, assassinations, espionage, politics and international intrigue.I strongly recommend that you purchase this set of DVD's. You may be late for work the next day as you tend to keep watching each episode on the disc (4 episodes per disc) until the wee hours of the morning.Why can't all TV shows be this good?	5.0	The Following Takes Place on your TV- action, drama, suspense	2005-07-22	3	2	1
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3Q65632Z2K95F	James Goodwin	If someone asks a '24' fan what the show is all about, this is the box set they should be handed in response.Now, some fans will argue that such a thing can be said about Season 1 as well, and that's actually quite true, but overall, '24' Day 2 ranks as one of the most thrilling and engaging seasons in the history of television. The tale revolves around an imminent threat to Los Angeles, prompting a collection of L.A.'s best agents -- and a woman who ends up getting some crucial information -- to unite in an attempt to counter it, and afterwards, a desperate effort to prevent a misdirected retaliatory strike by the U.S.This is the season in which the show hits its stride, doing plenty of notable things and doing them quite well.Character:We're introduced to Michelle Dessler -- who would go on to become the greatest heroine in '24' history. We've also got the development of Tony Almeida's true character in this season, which marked the beginning of his becoming the show's secondary male hero. We glimpse a very sympathetic side of George Mason, get Jack at his ever-driven finest, and before it's all over, we even see Sherry taken full circle.Writing:There are some great lines from David Palmer, particularly at the end, and without giving too much away, there's a very touching scene between George and his son this season, while the last scenes between George and Jack stand out as well. One of the most memorable lines comes when Jack comments that the thing about terrorists is that they want to blame the rest of the world for everything wrong with their lives.Action:Jack vs. Wald's group, the CTU bust just outside of L.A., Kate going undercover, and a simply amazing season finale are some of the highlights in this area.Romance:For a series that abounds in but isn't mainly centered around personal relationships, the romance you'll find between Jack and Kate in this one season is better written than that of some shows that actually are romantic dramas. Even now, it remains by far the most cleverly constructed and interesting one that the protagonist has ever been given. Like Jack's relationship with Teri, it worked because, throughout the day, it was in a stage of development. What the show doesn't seem to have grasped since is that Jack's most interesting romances were the ones of this variety, while his least interesting will always be the ones in which the feelings are sprung on us out of nowhere.Every thing that makes the show good and more is in this season. That's not to say there aren't flaws, just that the strengths outweigh them, and it's definitely not to say that the subsequent seasons aren't good -- just not quite as good as this one.	5.0	The Definitive Day	2006-01-27	3	3	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1EBJ93E1T50RT	Jason A. Miller	"I'll always have special affection for the second season of ""24"", because it was the first season I watched.  I knew the general outlines of the first season: events occur in real time, Dennis Hopper with a bad accent, Pedro Cerrano from ""Major League"" as a Presidential candidate, Jack's wife died in the last scene, etc.  I didn't see a single frame of any of that until years later.  Season 2 is when I actually started watching.Season 2 has a graver threat than Season 1: a nuclear bomb is set to go off in Los Angeles.  There's a whole Presidential administration to run, not just a campaign.  Jack has more at stake this time: not only is his daughter Kim still getting in danger every hour, but he also has to put his own life back on track.  As with season 1, there are several villains who appear sequentially, with Nina Myers making a vicious return, and the froggy-throated girl from Nickelodeon's ""Fifteen"" showing up as a sleeper-cell terrorist maniac.  Another Jack -- from ""Lost"" -- doesn't get into the act, but his TV dad (John Terry) does.The focus of the season shifts over the last two discs from the bomb blast to a threatened reprisal against three Middle Eastern countries.  What's fascinating here is that an idealist President refuses to rush into war because he suspects he's been supplied with faulty intelligence -- and all this played out in prime time in early 2003 as the war in Iraq was beginning on the basis of intelligence that also may have been doctored.If there's a weak spot to this year of ""24"", it may be Kim Bauer.  In Season 1, the threat against Jack extended to his family, so Kim's weekly perils usually tied back to the main plot.  In Season 3, a more mature Kim worked at CTU and dated Jack's sidekick, so, again, never far from the main plot.  In Season 2, however, Kim's efforts to escape the blast radius are thwarted by the increasingly bizarre obstacles the producers throw in her way: an over-the-top boss who's not just a murderer, but a pervert, too; a creepy poacher living alone in the woods; an inexperienced gunman holding up a convenience store; and a cougar.  Even Kim's boyfriend this season gets into the act: after surviving a car wreck in which, apart from a bloody nose, he is not shown to have any injuries at all, he returns in a hospital bed seven hours later... with a perfectly formed stump where his foot used to be.  Huh?The DVD content is brilliant.  Deleted scenes are incorporated for most of the 24 episodes.  There's one commentary track on each of the six discs, usually pairing the featured cast member for that episode with a producer, writer or director.  Kiefer Sutherland is mostly quiet for his commentary, although he raises a great point about how Jack Bauer regularly runs into ordinary citizens and inspires them into acts of great heroism.  Dennis Haysbert talks a lot about his inspirations for President Palmer (Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Colin Powell), and Penny Johnson talks about her inspiration for making Mrs. Palmer sympathetic (Condeleezza Rice, although one suspects Penny's opinion may have changed after this track was recorded in early 2003).  On the bonus disc, the deleted scenes are shown in order with commentary from three members of the production team.  A discarded concept for the season's final shot reveals a shockingly different Big Bad.

I think the writer of the show purposely writes her as a complete dingbat to get on our nerves.Other than that, best show on TV. If you haven't seen 24 yet then I suggest you start from season 1 (unfortunatly you'll have to hate Kim's Mom too). Then there is President Palmers wife. I'll stop there.Jack Bauer is awesome. Once you get into the show you won't stop. (you also won't stop yelling at the TV when you see Kim being stupid.)	4.0	4 stars only because;	2006-03-28	14	10	4

It's also not that I don't like it, because it was entertaining whenever said characters were not on it.SPOILERThe only solace I had was that I knew his wife would get killed off season 1 because she was unbearable, along with the daughter.END SPOILERThat said, watch Taken...much better story with family to the agent that understand that if dad tells you do this, then do just that, he must have some 411 on what's going on; hell the man saved your butt last season from multiple kidnappings and saved the president twice, I'm sure he knows what he is doing.  That said. I got as far as season 2 episode 3 before giving up.SPOILERScene that did for me...Kim getting away from that guy that beat his wife and daughter.

Jack shows vulnerability and Tony steps up to the plate, but not until after some end-runs.  Tony still struggling with when to follow it by the book and when to go rogue.  Jack doesn't have that problem.  More cliffhangers, some plot twists, and still an excellent series to watch.	5.0	Season 2	2014-06-05	0	0	0

The characters take on more depth and drama; especially President Palmer, his wife Sheri, and the staff. Not to mention our leading man, flawed-but-lovable-superhero, Jack Bauer.This drama is just chock full of unexpected twists and turns, knife-edged drama, and heart-wrenching choices to be made. The pace is frantic and heart-pounding. The moral, political, and ethical dilemas keep cascading on top of one another until the viewer is on the edge of the seat anxious to see them all unravel.This is terrific television and fun to watch; especially on DVD!

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2EP3MA5BC3CTR	Jesse Rozanski	"Day 2: Jack Bauer (Kiefer Southerland) has twenty-four hours to stop a terrorist cell from detonating a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles.This is my favorite show on television. No network TV show keeps its viewers on their edge of their seats like this show. This season had about six or seven dramatic plot twists and periods of intense action.However, I take issue with a couple of things about the second season. First, Elisha Cuthbert's character (Kim Bauer) seems to always find herself in a life or death situation and not just once in twenty-four hours but two or three times during the last two seasons. Her character has been kidnapped, held against her will, involved in a drug bust, arrested and jailed then kidnapped again. That was just the first season. I believe they need to re-examine Cuthbert's character before the start of the third season.The next issue I have is with the way it ended. Since the show had begun, the premise was to have a show that took place over the course of an entire day. Presumably, the show would end with the closing of the twenty-fourth hour. Season two did not end at the that point. Rather they left the story hanging so they could continue it next season. I thought they should have ended the season immediately but despite these issues, I don't believed that the overall integrity of the show was damaged.If you like edge-of-your-seat drama, incredible plot twist and intense periods of action, then ""24"" is a show for you."	5.0	One Of The Best Shows On Network TV	2003-08-13	1	0	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3AFNUPOSK2QGV	"Joe Kenney ""buttergun"""	"Season One of 24 was near-perfect television: movie-quality, with great characters, great cinematography, inventive action, clever plot twists, heart-rending drama, and satisfying conclusions.Season Two is even better.The story picks up a little over a year after the events of Season One.  Main character Jack Bauer, who was already a loose cannon in Season One, is now even more unhinged.  He's just as crazily determined as Mel Gibson's character Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon.""  Just as deadly too.  This makes him the perfect candidate for the mission at hand: find a nuclear bomb, somewhere in the LA area, that is going to go off sometime in the next 24 hours.  Bauer shows no mercy in his quest.I understand that some viewers, many of whom enjoyed Season One, refused to watch Season Two just because they didn't buy it that the same character could go through yet another crazy day.  I find this ridiculous.  That everything happens within a 24-hour period is the show's premise.  Not watching it because you think it's impossible is like not watching ""Star Trek"" because you don't believe in alien life, or not watching ""Buffy"" because you don't believe in vampires.  You have to buy into this show, for sure, but once you do, you find yourself swept along with it.Season One pushed the envelope of what can be shown on television, but Season Two tears the envelope to shreds.  I'm mostly a jaded viewer, but still I was shocked by the amount of carnage and violence on display.  I lost count of how many terrorists Bauer killed, and how many people were tortured.  So be aware that this show doesn't skimp on the violence quotient, which is fine for action junkies such as myself.The budget must have been significant for this season, as the quality of the production is high throughout.  No expenses seem to have been spared.  Let me just give you an idea.  There is a scene where a terrorist is tearing down a runway in a plane that's holding the nuclear bomb.  Bauer and his agents are in hot pursuit, in humvees.  All of this is shown as it actually happens - the plane going super fast, the humvees right behind.  Bauer gets on the roof of the humvee and shoots at the plane.  All of this is shown in the same angle, so you can see that they are actually doing the stunt, that it's not camera trickery.  Now, normally that would be something you'd see at the end of a big-budget film - but this was just the middle half of episode 13!That's just one of the many great action scenes at hand.  Episode 9 features a well-done combat sequence, in which Jack takes on a team of rogue US commandos.  There's more machine gun and small arms fire in this one scene than in most big-budget feature films.  There's another great night-time alley battle in Episode 20 or thereabouts, in which Bauer and two comrades are holed up in an abandoned building, while a squad of heavily armed terrorists track them down.The show isn't just all action.  There's lots of drama on hand, as well.  Normally I shy from the stuff, I find too much of it comes off a bit Lifetime channel-ish.  But the drama reached here is better handled than just about any other movie I can think of.  The heights reached go way beyond the normal strands of television.  Jack's yearning for reconciliation with his daughter, the President's resolve to stand firm, the reunion of Jack and Nina Myers, George Mason saying goodbye to his son, Jack saying goodbye to his daughter from an airplane, and the resolutions to all of these plot threads in the final episode; every one of these scenes, and more, are carried off effectively.I considered Season One to be like a well-done feature film, stretched out over 24 episodes.  Season Two is the same, but it could just as easily be compared to a novel.  There's foreshadowing, set-ups, and resolutions, which each episode working as a chapter.  Things mentioned in early episodes sometimes don't come into play until near the end of the series.  That's one of my favorite things about the show.  It never once insults the viewer's intelligence.  It requires he or she to keep up with events, to remember things.  Nothing is spoon-fed.Season One was originally only greenlit for 12 episodes, but was expanded by Fox to 24 episodes mid-season, requiring the producers to sometimes grasp at straws to continue stretching the tension.  However, Season Two was greenlit for 24 episodes from the get-go, meaning that there is no mid-season slump, this time around, and that the story evolves and expands naturally.So, is everything perfect?  Well, not exactly.  Most reviewers will bring up the oft-ridiculed Kim Bauer plotline, in which Jack's nubile daughter runs from one bizarre encounter to the next, each more unbelievable than the last.  Season One's mid-season downfall occurred when Jack's wife suffered from amnesia, a plot development that just about everyone hated, but in no way does Season Two slump so bad.  I didn't mind the Kim plotline, because I enjoyed the dark comedy of it all.  I mean, the girl goes from being chased by a maniacal guy who's gone buck wild for no reason at all, to being chased by cops, to meeting a deranged loner who lives in a bomb shelter, to getting involved in a hostage situation.Now, most of the scenes with Kim involve her running around.  She wears tight clothing throughout.  The actress portraying Kim is a very shapely, beautiful young woman.  24 is a Fox Television program.  Girl in tight clothes, running around.  Fox program.  NOW do you see why the Kim plotline was added?The DVD release is flawless.  Unlike Season One, there are actually chapter stops!  This alone is cause for celebration.  There are 6 audio commentaries spread throughout the season, and deleted/alternate scenes for most episodes.  You have the option of integrating these scenes back into the episodes by selecting that feature on each episode's menu, or you can watch all of them, separated from the shows they're from, on the bonus 7th disc of the set.  This is a nice feature, as I prefer watching the episodes without interruption, and then watching what was taken out later.  The video and audio presentation is flawless.In short, 24 is a fast-paced, action-packed, emotion-pulling tour de force; an intelligent, mature, supremely-crafted piece of entertainment that surpasses any other action TV program I've ever seen.  The final episode is just as satisfying as the conclusions of ""Die Hard,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""The Rock,"" or any other action movie you could name.  If you are a discerning viewer who believes there's nothing on TV worth watching, get ready to have all of your notions blown away.The only way I can sum it all up is this: for years now, I've been a TV snob.  Never watched ""Friends,"" never watched ""Law & Order,"" never watched ""CSI.""  As far as I was concerned, the only show worth watching was ""the Simpsons.""  I still think it's the best show in TV history, but that's a story/review/debate for another time.  So when I say that I think Season Two of 24 is certainly equal to - and in a few ways better than - the Simpsons, please understand that this is the highest praise I can give."	5.0	24 more hours of pure entertainment	2004-01-08	6	5	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AQBRMBQ99ESI7	"John A Lee III ""jal3"""	"Season two has just as much excitement and suspense as season one. Terrorists want to blow up a nuke in LA. The president turns to Jack Bauer to solve the problem. The president is helped by his own integrity but faces real problems of backbiting within his administration. CTU has the same problem. The president is great. I wish we really had leaders like this.Episode Synopses appear below:8 AM - 9 AM - Jack Bauer has left the CTU after the death of his wife. He's having a hard time coping. Things are not made any better by his estrangement from his daughter. Senator Palmer from the last season is now President Palmer. When word comes that an Arab terrorist cell has a nuclear device set to go off in Los Angeles TODAY, the president insists that Bauer be brought in on the case. He is reluctant but does so on the condition that his daughter is taken to safety outside the city. President Palmer still seems to be the honest and upstanding guy he was in the last season. He lays down the law to the suspect government without equivocation but also refuses to jump to any conclusions. Jack, on the other hand, is even grittier than before. He will do what it takes to save the city even if it means executing a child molester. The daughter, Kim, continues to further demonstrate her propensity to hook up with losers. She works as a nanny for a little girl. The husband obviously has the hots for her but is a wife beater, daughter beater and nanny beater. It's going to be another long day.9 AM - 10 AM - Kim and the girl she watches over manages to make an escape but the psychopath is after them. There is no indication that he is involved with the terrorists at this point but he's enough to ruin anyone's day. Jack makes contact with the first level of bad guys by cashing in on an old acquaintance who thinks he's another crook. They are suspicious but Jack manages to convince them in a rather unorthodox way that violates lots of civil rights. They are still suspicious. CTU has problems as well. One of the functionaries is frightened enough that she has a hard time doing her job. Worse is the guy who runs the unit. He is frightened and making a beeline to get out of the potential blast radius. That leaves CTU without an effective head. The President has his own problems. He doesn't want to panic the nation but a reporter is suspicious and about to blow up the whole thing on TV. Convincing the reporter to keep the story under wraps is not easy so he gets some civil rights violated as well. There is also a bride with problems. She is about to get married to a guy who might be one of the Middle East terrorists. The supposition is that he is using her as a cover. The bride's sister is suspicious and trying to check up on him but has no real reason to connect him to any plot.10 AM - 11 AM - The psychotic father has reported Kim Bauer as a kidnapper. Kim is still trying to get herself and the girl away from him. She finally calls her father for help but it is a bad time. He is in the car with some terrorists on their way to blow up CTU. Since he is acting weird, she freaks out and calls CTU for help; she takes a bus for CTU. Jack can't get in touch to warn CTU that they are a target because the terrorists have interrupted the phone line. So Jack calls the president to try and get a message through to evacuate the place. Since the president is in the middle of a press conference, a staffer takes the call. She wants to let the president know immediately but another staffer with his own agenda has other plans. He calls CTU to get them to pass all their data along to them. This takes them off of jobs that they need to be doing. As Mason, the cowardly director, tries to flee the blast area, he gets a call to check out a lead. He does divert to check it out and finds part of the trail but is ambushed. These terrorists seem to be of the domestic variety instead of the Arab one. The sister of the bride learns that her suspicions are well founded but is told not to tell anyone else for fear of her endangering her family and herself. She is a poor actress (in this context) and everyone wonders why she is acting so strangely.11 AM - 12 PM - The terrorist bomb got the CTU. Many are dead and others are dying. Kim was walking in right as they started to evacuate. She is alive but the little girl she is caring for starts having seizures because of the beatings from her father. Kim is now a suspect in those beatings. Jack gets the location of the next contact up the line but while doing so has to eliminate those he is with. The guys who blew up the CTU are a bunch of home grown nuts. They know nothing about the nuke and have been duped. Jack finds the guy but he is holed up in his own personal bomb shelter. When he finally believes the plot is real, he takes drastic action but not before he gives Jack one more clue that leads in an unexpected direction. Mason the cowardly leader of the Los Angeles CTU finally shows some guts. Since he has been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation, he has nothing to lose and heads back to take charge and make difficult choices. The president is having trouble with those closest to him. One of his advisors is trying to keep the president in the dark and the other wants to tell him. The one who wants to block it has political and personal power motives. When the president finds out he's been kept in the dark, he is rightfully hacked.  The bridegroom continues to act suspiciously and his soon to be sister in law gets more and more paranoid. The private investigator she hired has set off some red flags and he is taken into custody by the feds.12 PM - 1 PM - The child beating father manages to intimidate both Kim and the mother to keep them from saying anything bad about him. Kim finally manages to get in touch with her father who tells her what is going on. He swears her to secrecy and makes her promise to leave town. She agrees and then promptly gets others involved in an effort to rescue the little girl from the hospital.  The lead provided by Jack's previous suspect leads right to Nina, the mole from last season who killed his wife. She has information but will not say anything until she gets a presidential pardon. The president is inclined to capitulate because the options are worse. Jack learns about this and strong-arms Mason into letting him handle the interrogation. The president is also leaning on the country suspected of funding the terrorists. Against the advice of all, he agrees to an intelligence exchange. As the ambassador is leaving, though, his chopper crashes and he is killed. Meanwhile, CTU is onto the bridegroom and sends someone out to interrogate him. Naturally, the bride freaks out.1 PM - 2 PM - Jack is interrogating Nina to find out more about the plot. His strategy is to convince her that he will kill her and does not care about the consequences. It's effective but gets only limited results. Jack has to take her to meet the next person up the chain. The president is trying to keep the lid on things but having a staff that is infighting among itself proves frustrating. It is even worse when the ex-wife from hell shows up sowing more distrust (which is probably deserved) and making another power grab for herself. The plot to free the child from the hospital gets complicated. Kim is much less adept at these matters than her father but she does show some promise. The interrogation of the bridegroom seems stalled until his parents show up. Then he finally gives up the goods on someone completely unexpected. He may or may not be telling the truth but the CTU agent buys his story.2 PM - 3 PM - Jack sets Nina up to meet her contact. Nobody trusts her. She leads them to her contact but slips her leash for a brief period. The contact is wounded. The president's administration is riven by suspicion. The ex wife is just making things worse. Its to run an investigation when you think that anybody is just waiting to stab you in the back. Mason's symptoms are getting worse. He brings in his son to effect reconciliation before he dies. Kim and her boyfriend are making their escape with the little girl and everything seems to be going in their favor when they get stopped for a traffic violation. The cop is gong to let them go when he notices something dripping from the trunk. It's not ketchup.3 PM - 4 PM - Kim and her boyfriend are arrested for murder. They and the little girl are taken back towards LA. She finally gets the sheriff to get in touch with CTU and Jack. He is on his way back with Nina and one of the terrorists and is distracted by his daughter's pleas for help. He gets further distracted when Nina gets the location of the bomb and kills the terrorist. She is now in a strong bargaining position. The president's wife is worming her way deeper and deeper into intrigue. She convinces the president to let her talk to the reporter being held. The original terrorists finally put in another appearance. They are trying to get their bomb to the right site. They are having a bad day as well. Car trouble and a terrorist who is having second thoughts mess up their original plans. The sister who hired the PI to investigate the Arab groom is worried since her dad is taken into custody. She gets the PI to hack into his files in order to clear him. Instead, things get more suspicious. There is a possible explanation; Dad claims to be an agent as well. It becomes moot when unknown parties abduct the sister and the PI. All the attempts at secrecy start to fall apart when the reporter somehow gets free and goes live with a panic story. About this time, the plane with Jack and Nina starts to fall out of the air.4 PM - 5 PM - Recordings show that the president's ex wife was not the one who let the reporter go. It was a fired staffer. This seemingly clears the wife but don't be too sure about that. The plane with Jack and Nina has crashed. They are both alive and search and rescue is on the way. Some well armed soldiers show up first and they are trouble. The only thing that might save Jack and Nina is his Special Forces background. This gives Nina a chance to get the drop on Jack and make more demands. She wants a pardon for the murder of Jack in return for information on the location of the bomb. The sister and her PI have been abducted by the head honcho terrorist. They want to know what they found in her father's files and torture IS an option. The only thing that might be in her favor is that the address given up by Nina might be the one where she is being held. The father of the bride is looking more and more guilty and the Arab groom is looking more and more innocent. That makes the bride believe that her fianc&eacute; has turned on her dad. It is a no win situation for grooms. At least the beaten little girl seems to be getting to safety. The same cannot be said of Kim and her boyfriend.5 PM - 6 PM - The distrust in the president's cabinet is raised even higher when Jack reports that he was attacked by US troops from a unit run by the NSA. The president is inclined to arrest the director but his ex wife persuades him to wait until he has more proof. She is making herself more and more valuable but the snake is not to be trusted. Kim and her boyfriend are being transported to the LA jail but manage to stage an attempt to get away. She does but others are not so lucky. Jack takes down the address given to him by Nina with a rescue squad. He manages to rescue the sister of the bride but the bad guy swallows a cyanide capsule and that source of information is lost. The big bad guy is still at large. Things start coming together but they are confusing. The bride has a big surprise for everyone, especially the groom.6 PM - 7 PM - The blushing bride is up to her eyeballs in the nuclear plot. Presumably her father is as well. There is also some suspicion about the sister but Jack thinks she is clean. The ex wife of the president is up to her eyeballs in the plot against the president's administration. She gets the head of the NSA, one of her cohorts, arrested. The president knows something is fishy. He authorizes some unsavory and extra legal methods to get information. An assault on a mosque known to have the head terrorist winds up without the quarry. Meanwhile, the bad sister (bride) manages to get the nuclear triggers. Kim doesn't get very far in her bid to get away. She finds a large cat who considers her to be a tasty and nutritious way to end the day.7 PM - 8 PM - The terrorist does not get away, as seemed would happen and Jack uses the same interrogation philosophy used by the president but his methods are even uglier. The bride's sister finds out that the bride has been implicated in the murder of the groom and the terrorist plot. She doesn't want to believe it but agrees to set up a cell phone trace. Dad doesn't want to believe it either but fills in some information about her past. Just when things don't seem to be able to get any uglier, Jack gets the information he needs. The bomb is at an airport. Evidence begins to mount that the rat in his office is his ex wife. That further ratchets up the tension.  A rescuer finds Kim and likes what he sees.8 PM - 9 PM - The corrupt head of the NSA finally breaks under interrogation and confirms the location of the bomb. He also reveals the existence of a rogue US paramilitary force that will kill anyone who gets in the way of their getting the bomb. Jack finds them but they are dead. They have been executed by somebody. Kim's rescuer turns out to be a nut in his own right. He's a survivalist and has is own personal bomb shelter with quite an arms cache. He's been looking forward to a bomb burst for some time. Getting Kim into his bomb shelter raises expectations. Bureaucrats from CTU are worried about the bombed out base of operations and want to move things up to their office. George Mason, the irradiated head of the local office, steps forward and won't let them do it. They have too many operations in play at the moment. The higher ups have heard that he is no longer able to run things but he puts on a good face. He is failing fast, though.  The NSA director, while being confronted lets slip that there is one more commando unaccounted for but fails to let them know that the ex wife is part of the plot. Jack and his team manage to stop the plane with the bomb but it is a decoy. The bomb is still in play. When the NSA director learns about this, he does point the finger.9 PM - 10 PM - CTU has the pilot of the plane but he claims that he was doing it for his family. They were to be paid when he blew himself up. He claims not to know about the bomb being a dummy or about the location of the real one. The sister of the bride has proven most helpful thus far but she is nave. When she sees her sister, she runs to find her and try to get things ""straightened out"". She does not count on her sister being willing to kill her to get her badge. Luckily, Jack is not nave. The president confronts his ex wife and, reluctantly, she admits that she has been plotting but she claims not to know about how the plans have unraveled. She might even be telling the truth but her track record is against her. Kim's rescuer gets more and more exited. He is looking forward to repopulating the world which doesn't need populating. His lies begin to unravel and she gets suspicious. George Mason comes to the point where he knows he can't do the job any more because of the radiation sickness. He bows out and turns things over to Tony and is a real class act. The episode ends with them finding the bomb. At least that is what we are supposed to believe. With this series, though, all we can be sure of is that everyone is probably wrong.10 PM - 11 PM - The bomb has a little less than an hour before it goes off. Jack decides to fly it as far from LA as possible. There are two options. One is to head out to sea and the other is to head for the desert. Each has drawbacks. The desert is chosen. It is a suicide run. Jack is planning on flying it himself but he has a stowaway. Because of that, he may survive after all. CTU has a diplomatic problem. They are cracking information on a terrorist hard drive which implicate three foreign governments. Many people are urging the president to prepare for war but there is the possibility that the allegations are false. Only time will tell and time is running out. Time does run out on the bomb with the inevitable consequences.11 PM - 12 AM - The bomb has gone off and Jack is alive. The big problem at present is that there is some belief that three foreign governments were part of the plot. Strangely enough, there is reason to believe him but there is much evidence to contradict him. There is the distinct possibility that the governments are being framed. CTU assessment gets garbled when it gets passed to the president and it looks like the US is going to war. Jack is asked to further interrogate the prime suspect to determine if he is lying and he agrees to do so but he is distracted by concern for his daughter. He gets an answer but the terrorist is assassinated moments later. Could this be the last member of the rogue US team? Whoever it is, he is offering Jack evidence that the recordings implicating the foreign governments are is faked. The price is breaking the bride's sister out of CTU. Kim thinks her dad is dead and she is trying to figure out what to do. She goes into a closed store to use the bathroom and the craziness is just beginning. People are trying to rob the store and the chaos factor grows.12 AM - 1 AM - Jack breaks Kate out of CTU in order to try and find out about the possibility of the evidence against the unnamed middle eastern countries being fabricated. This makes Jack a suspicious character in CTU's eyes.  The cabinet is pushing for war but the president will not back down from his insistence that they must get this right. This makes others think he is losing his nerve and the plotting begins to thicken. Jack finds the missing 7th member of the strike team. He wants Kate as a hostage to ensure his getaway. He says he has evidence that a business cartel arranged the plot. Jack sees no choice but to make the transfer. All seems to go well then all are ambushed by parties unknown. The situation at the convenience store has gotten out of hand. A man has been killed and Kim is being held hostage until the police take the wife of the killer a safe distance from the city.1 AM - 2 AM - Getting out of the ambush set of for Jack and his source takes a lot of effort. He requires the help from inside CTU but his source is under suspicion. They manage to get away but the head guy is shot in the escape. Only he can tell where the information is and he refuses to go to a hospital. Eventually he realizes he is dying and starts to tell Jack where the information is hidden but he waits too long. Kim still thinks her dad is dead and has been taken into custody by the LA county sheriff's office. Now with events the way they are, the authorities are inclined to believe her earlier story but she is still in trouble for some of the escape attempt. The president is dealing with problems as well. His cabinet is being less than fully supportive and is second guessing him. The military is unsatisfied with the way things are being done and rioting is beginning to break out in the east. Shootings by the National Guard only make matters worse.2 AM - 3 AM - Jack finds a tracking device in the chip with the evidence. He sends the evidence with Kate and the foreign agent to get back to CTU. He takes the tracker himself to decoy the hostiles in a different direction. His distraction works but he gets caught. That sets up another torture scenario with Jack on the receiving end. The hidden powers want the evidence suppressed and a great deal of money rides on it. Things at CTU are starting to fall apart. Personal agendas and family relations are tearing working relationships apart.  The president's cabinet has been summoned to a secret meeting. It looks like the Vice President is staging a coup.3 AM - 4 AM - The torture keeps getting worse for Bauer and he still refuses to give up the information the terrorists want. He does manage to get free and get a name for the higher ups. Kate and the foreign intelligence officer are about to head to CTU when they get caught by some hysterical people looking to kill Arabs. The guy gets a beating and robbed and the thugs get the chip. Kate offers them money if she can get the chip back and they take her to her house for the payoff. The president's loyal advisor is critically injured as she tries to escape the custody one of those holding her. The president is suspicious but unaware that his NSA director is at the heart of the plot. The vice president is as bad as the ex wife about being a power hungry @$$4 AM - 5 AM - Jack gets the chip and tries to transmit the data but the chip is damaged. He tries to get some CTU types to clean up the data but there is a power grab in process by some types working with the vice president. The president also has problems. He is on trial by his cabinet. The VP is going for broke and has perjured testimony ready. The vote is ugly. The results are uglier. The one slim hope is to find the guy who actually did the forgery work. Jack heads that way. What he finds is the ugliest thing yet.5 AM - 6 AM - The president is relieved and the VP takes over. Planes are on the way and the beginning of the war is imminent. Power struggles within the cabinet leave enough uncertainty for the president to get a Secret Service agent working on his side. Power struggles within CTU also hang things up. Jack's only source of help is relieved of duty. Jack has found not only the guy who doctored the tapes but the BIGGEST TRAITOR OF ALL. The traitor is still trying to wheel and deal and the geek is worried about the future. He doesn't want to go to jail and is frightened. He doesn't know whether to trust Jack or the traitor. He gives the traitor a knife and Jack the slip. Kim Bauer finally makes another significant part of the story line. She is laboring under the delusion that everything will now be fine and the bits and pieces are being mopped up. A deputy takes her to her former employer's house to pick up her things. The wife beater is hiding out there. Kim learns that sometimes life is nasty and survival is nastier.6 AM - 7 AM - Jack catches up with the fleeing computer geek but not before he manages to critically hurt himself. CTU sends a chopper to pick him up but the political types call it off before the pickup can be made. This has severe health consequences for the geek. That means that Jack has to rely on the traitor. He wants the rat to set up a meet with the big guys to try and get evidence. Jacks biggest problem besides being stuck with a traitor, and needing to stop a war is that he has been damaged by the torture. That lowers his effectiveness and he has to trust the least trustworthy person in the entire series.  The VP's government needs a deal too. Some of the bombers have been spotted and the Turks want to talk to Palmer personally. The VP needs him to pretend like he is still the president. That is the only way to save the American aircrews. After showing a bit of spunk, Kim is now in shock over shooting the guy that wanted to kill her. Jack sends Kate to pick her up but Kim doesn't know or trust Kate.7 AM - 8 AM - The president's lawyer finds some corroborating evidence. This makes the president's chief of staff have second thoughts. He orders CTU to help Bauer. That gets Bauer's associates off the hook but  Bauer is struggling to get to the meet and he thinks he is unsupported. When he finally makes contact, time is running out. He has to trust the arch traitor to wear a wire. Kim and Kate make it to CTU. Jack the traitor goes through with the meet live and on the air. They get the evidence but who knows whether the VP wants to accept it. That's a political problem. Jack's problem is that the stress causes problems with his heart. All of the goals seem to be met but things are set up for further trouble. The ending is the real surprise."	5.0	"Nobody has Worse ""Bad Days"" than Jack Bauer"	2006-03-21	9	4	5

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A32OJJHXDSKKLD	John B. L. Lambert	For us 80's generation who miss the good old days, when television used to mean something, and are suffering with all these reality shows, 24 has offered to me relief. This pulse pounding, cliff hanging, thriller is the best show on television right now. Jack Bauer, is the ulitmate hero, he breaks the rules, takes risks, whatever it takes to get the job done. I thought Season 2 was better than the first, more character development, and more plots. This show leaves the question, how far does one go, to save millions of people. Jack Bauer, kills a suspect, in custody, threatens to kill a terrorist's family, in order to get answers about the Nucluear Bomb. President Palmer, illegally detains a nosy reporter, to keep him from leaking the news about the bomb, and has Secret Service torture one of his own staff, in order to get information. I have to say, if this were real life, whatever it takes to get the job done. The only draw back on this show is Kim Bauer' Jack's daugther who just doesn't think, she just keeps getting in more trouble, but its just ridicoulous, because she is so dumb.I loved all the characters, the CTU staff, the White House, staff, the new family that is introduced, that play big roles. I also love how the show makes you think about each hour of the day, and how precious time really is. 24 is a great action thriller, that feeds that craving we all have for action. Kiefer Sutherland is the best, this show beats any other television show, I highly recomend buying this DVD, then stay up and watch all twenty four episodes.	5.0	The BEST show on Television right now	2003-09-13	1	0	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AO9J9F3O1BT7B	John	I was always skeptical about 24 going into a second season. It ended near perfectly at the end of the first season. Buy when I checked out season two, I was hooked all over again. Not only is the season more interesting, it involves issues that our world is currently dealing with. Not only that, but the action has been pumped up 400%, that acting keeps getting better, and Jack (Keifer Sutherland) is one of the best characters to follow on TV.With the finale just around the corner, and a new third season on the way, I think it is safe to say this DVD is a perfect buy for any fan of the show, or anybody who missed its initial run and wants to see what all the hype is about. Surely it will have many more special features than season 1 did, since the first season DVD was produced and created in about 2 months. Most likely as well as the stuff season one's had, like preview for season three, and quite possibly an alernate ending. Hopefully they will put in some commentaries in the mix as well.But anyway.....Fox is doing a great job with their TV on DVD lately. They started off slow, but with sales growing and growing, they are picking up the pace, and seem to be producing better quality DVD's.Now I just need to wait for the rest of Angel, The Shield, Farscape, The Dead Zone, and The Simpsons to be released.....	5.0	:::24::: The Best Thing on TV!	2003-05-01	55	46	9

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1G87F22A91T6O	Johnnie R. Norton	'24' Season Two is a very good season, but the first season remains superior. The most obvious reason is this: Season One had Jack fighting terrorists to save his family vs. Season Two having Jack fighting terrorists to save the world. While this doesn't deter from the season's terrific if sometimes contrived tension, it does hinder the season's emotional impact as a whole. It must be said, however, that some episodes, especially towards season's end, do pack quite an emotional punch. This season deals with isolation, and it is apparent in the main storyline, which involves the estrangement of Jack Bauer and his daughter Kim, stemming from a traumatizing event that happened to them a year from Day One (or season one).Here are the highlights of '24' Season Two:1) The interwoven plots are mesmerizing to watch as they build to furious climaxes, which is especially the case with a subplot involving Kate Warner (Sarah Wynter) and her sister Marie's wedding, which is planned for the day. Marie Warner (Laura Harris) is engaged to a man named Reza who is suspected of terrorism. Sarah Wynter does a good job with conveying a sense of disarray when her world is turned upside down. Laura Harris is terrific as her emotional sister. What happens with their characters over the 24-hour period will surely amaze you.2) The acting is excellent. Elisha Cuthbert reprises her role as Kim Bauer, who is now a high school dropout working as a nanny for a child abuser. While she doesn't have anything to do with the other plots (which are connected very nicely) her plot seems isolated to give the audience an impression of the emotional distance between her and Jack, and she conveys her emotions very well. Kiefer Sutherland gives Jack Bauer a tough-guy persona this time around, and it keeps the action grounded in tension and complexity, because you never know what he might try to do next. Dennis Haysbert is vibrant as President Palmer, and new character Michelle Dessler (Reiko Alyesworth) plays potential love interest to Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard). Both Alyesworth and Bernard fit into their roles perfectly. Xander Berkeley is particularly effective here as George Mason, a man who goes from being self-serving to courageous after going through tough circumstances.Also worthy of mention is the return of Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) and Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald), two of television's most riveting villainesses. They shake things up in the worlds of their ex-partners. The acting by Clarke is well done, but it is Jerald who makes '24' Season Two always watchable. Penny Johnson Jerald deserved an Emmy nomination for her work here.3) The sets are never less than convincing. The special effects and production values are of high quality.The only low point of the season is Kim's subplot. While she does make smart decisions offscreen (as seen in the deleted scenes), her character comes across as not being very intelligent. The obstacles she goes through are tense but unnecessary and distract from the main action. It is not Elisha Cuthbert's fault that her character's script is much weaker than her fellow actors; the fault lies with the writers. Regardless, Cuthbert plays Kim exquisitely and makes us care about her character even when she is faced with ridiculous situations.'24' Season Two is uneven and while it may not be as good as season one, it still works well. It is fast-paced, tension-filled, and driven by a plot that gets juicier by the minute. The season finale is sensational, providing a satisfactory conclusion to another exhaustive day for Jack Bauer. You will be gratefully exhausted once seeing the inventive and explosive second season of '24'.	4.0	'24' Season Two Is Flawed but Fabulous	2005-10-23	2	2	0

I highly recommend watching Season One first, in fact I think it should be required because many Season Two plot twists refer to things that happen in Season One.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AV2FJV0OF509U	Jordean	"I know this series has been out for ages, but I've just gotten around to watching. Season one was enjoyable overall, but rather than fine-tune the series, the writers threw it all out the window and basically started all over again. Not in a good way.They should have filmed the series in 24 hours, so that the characters in ep. 24 are really fatigued and showing the signs of exhaustion (including 5 o'clock shadow, impaired motor skills, bad judgment)...President Palmer was apparently born to be duped. He is not suspicious at all when his ex-wife shows up at the presidential compound. Peeved perhaps, but that's about it. When she suddenly has all sorts of expertise, contacts and information on the bad guys in the NSA, he's not the least bit surprised, but instead reminisces about the good old days, and how she could really be on top of things.Once Palmer discovers that a group within the NSA was trying to push him to war, and helped smuggle a nuclear device into the country, he should have shut the entire saber-rattling enterprise down. Since it's obvious the baddies in his own government were pushing for war, one would think he would assemble his cabinet and make clear what had happened, and what he would NOT do (ie go to war). Whether a foreign government played a role in this or not, the MAJOR problem is that Palmer has a cabal of traitors in his own government, and needs to be finding out who is loyal. Then start house cleaning.The plot is obviously lifted from ""Seven Days in May"" and ""Sum of All Fears"", but doesn't synthesize the two plausibly. In the end Palmer faces a real dilemma when the proof comes through that foreigners WEREN'T responsible for the attack. How can he explain that, credibly, to the American people? Haven't watched the last episode yet (shudder) but we'll see.I find the graphic nature of the torture scenes gratuitous. We get the point. Move on. The gunplay is ridiculous. Good guys making 50 yard snap shots, scoring one-hit kills on baddies on rooftops. But baddies hosing automatic fire and scoring no hits (except on the one guy who has info to stop the war).Between the first and second seasons, someone apparently hired a PC consultant. The real bad guys appear to be evil white militias and conservatives in the government, and in the wake of the bomb's detonation, the government seems excessively concerned with protecting American Muslims, to the point of sending in the national guard. Rather than get on TV and speak directly to the American people and simply ask that in the name of decency that people remain calm. I know, probably wouldn't work, much better to mobilize the armed forces so they can fight Americans and the ""Middle East"" simultaneously.The cloying way in which the writers carefully show us that Islam is a religion of peace, and then shift the focus to domestic intolerance is cloying and preachy. I wish people would stop assuming that Americans don't know that not all Russians, Chinese, Muslims, North Koreans, etc. are evil. Just tell the story and get it done.Finally, I missed the part where Palmer actually made an announcement to the American people that a nuclear device had detonated. His silence leads to panic and civil disorder. Imagine if he had gone on the horn right away and announced that facts had indicated it was a training accident. People would have been concerned, but no panic. If he later finds out it's a terror attack, he can then correct the record. He seems ineffective, not in control of his government, and frankly a dangerous leader. Contrast that with President Lyman in ""Seven Days in May"" who was politically-astute and decisive.Our standards, either in presidents or screenwriters, have plummeted."	2.0	Lost the fire of season 1	2014-05-11	1	1	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3OH101U0CPUC7	Joseph Boone	"Season 2 follows Jack Bauer as he tries to stop a nuclear bomb from exploding in the city of Los Angeles in addition to preventing a war of retaliation springing from that same event. Most of the cast from the first season is back including the now-President David Palmer and his ex-wife Sherry. Jack's daughter Kim and the crew from CTU including villain Nina Meyers all are present and accounted for. I won't reveal much of the story specifics because too much of the enjoyment of 24 revolves around the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. Suffice it to say, that the viewer is kept guessing about much of what is going on and Jack is put through a very bad day indeed.As with24 - Season One, there are some real highs and lows here. Jack himself is great and the show is at its best when we watch him do what he does best. President Palmer, played by Dennis Haysbert, has great presence and is always compelling to watch. The struggle to find the nuke and stop it from killing millions of people is riveting and provided for some very exciting moments. Unfortunately, that story is resolved in episode 16 along with virtually every other plot thread and then the show tries to start a whole new series of stories revolving around a war to retaliate against three countries that may have been involved in the plot to nuke LA. The season really loses steam at this point and almost every aspect feels extremely contrived and unrealistic. Instead of building to a great climax, it wheezes across the finish line like an out of shape marathon runner. I know it wouldn't have the same marketing pizzazz but they honestly should have named this season ""16"" and finished after 16 hours. It would have made for a far stronger product.The worst aspect of Season 2 is undoubtedly Kim Bauer and her increasingly unlikely story where she meets and is threatened by what appears to be every psychotic in the greater LA area and even a mountain lion thrown is for good measure. There is no connection whatsoever to the main story, she's just there for Jack to worry about and, apparently, to annoy viewers. One plot that was somewhat interesting was civil unrest and rioting related to the bomb but after several scenes building tension on this point it simply fades away unresolved and forgotten. Other flaws include CTU headquarters apparently having no restrictions to family and friends walking around at will, a phony urgency to retaliate with hours of the nuke or never, and more.The funny thing about 24 is that you can point out endless flaws that are silly and easily avoidable yet the show's twists and turns largely carry you through them on sheer momentum. Kiefer Sutherland is fantastic in the lead role and also helps viewers ignore most of the worst flaws. Still, there's no question the show would be far less frustrating and more enjoyable if the writers would dig a little deeper and make a more honest effort to provide less contrived situations and an understanding of national security that surpasses that of the average 12 year old. I do recommend this season of 24, but only to those who are willing to accept some frustration with their entertainment."	3.0	Should have ended at hour 16	2007-12-02	9	7	2

Yes I did, but let me repeat it again.  With all the day's events, Jack wouldn't get out unscathed (physically, at least) unlike Season 1.  There you go, now you know.

I'm not a fan of torture but I just skip that part. Otherwise, Jack is Back! And I love Jack Bauer. I have to agree with others that say that Kim's story doesn't have a lot to do with Jack's so far so it gets kinda lost. But she is still Jack Bauer's daughter and I think act's pretty smart for all the situation's she get's herself into. I say, get's herself into, because this season she's not being kidnapped so all the things that happen to her are almost self inflicted. One thing she did that wasn't smart was after the cop car crashed and she runs into the woods and keeps going. In my opinion she should have stayed hidden near the crash until the cops and ambulance left and got back on the road. That wasn't smart. Now she's a young pretty thing walking down deserted roads at midnight.	5.0	I love Jack Bauer!!	2014-05-24	0	0	0

It's highly addictive and has a cult following so you might as well join in.You may already know the premise of the show (24 hours - 24 episodes one hour each), but during one of the last episodes of season 2 there is a scene where Ms Palmer is at a football stadium. In this stadium is a very large clock. The editors of this movie had set the time to this clock at 7:24 (I believe) and the plot of the story was exactly at 7:24.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"After Jack Bauer successfully saved Presidential candidate, David Palmer from assassination and witnessed his wife's murder at the hands of former lover and colleague Nina Myers, there didn't seem to be much more that could go wrong for Jack.  If you thought the worst part of Jack Bauer's life was over, then, you don't know Jack!Picking up approximately 2 years after the events of ""24: Season One"", Jack's life is in shambles.  Jack, (played brilliantly by Keifer Sutherland) no longer works at CTU, his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) has all but severed ties with him because of the constant reminder of her dead mother, and now the security of the United States is threatened yet again.  Now terrorists have threatened to detonate a nuclear device in the middle of L.A., now faced with a possible panic current President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) must ask Jack Bauer to come out of retirement, and infiltrate the terrorist cell behind the threat and stop the bomb from being detonated.After an incredible, action packed first season, many felt the Fox network really had their work cut out for them in returning for a second season of ""24"".  Using the same real-time format, virtually the same cast and having more bad stuff happen in the so called, ""City of Angels"", and calling upon the same man to save the day.  It seemed as if Fox was maybe expecting too much from television audiences; however, any critics were quickly silenced when the clock began ticking on Day 2 of this gripping drama, as week after week audiences across America tuned in to see just how Jack Bauer and Co. were going to save the day.  The redeeming fact to what makes this show believable, aside from the real-time format and realistic characters, is the fact that in season 2, or Day 2, the process to solving this threat is conducted with more teamwork.  Yes, Jack works primarily alone, but he utilizes his fellow CTU agents much more to his advantage this time around.If you thought Day 1 was bad enough, Day 2 will blow you away.""24: Season 2"" is highly recommended."	5.0	The Clock Is Ticking...Again	2005-07-03	2	2	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2HG5MY4YOY7N2	Kelvin H.	Season 2 is probably the best of the three. This one is much more gripping and does not include farfetched moments such as sudden amnesia in Season One. Everything in season 2 is suspenseful; from finding the nuclear bomb to the 24th Amendment on President Palmer and the aftermath of the nuclear bomb. &quot;24&quot; is so ingenious in making everything so fresh and original in each episode despite following one guideline throughout the year which is to stop the bomb. The finale is much more exciting with a cliffhanger ending that makes you wish this show would be called &quot;48.&quot; I can't wait until season 4 for more suspense that only &quot;24&quot; can deliver.	5.0	www.filmwiseguy.funtigo.com	2004-07-08	9	8	1
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2PXHFGJZBNLXB	Kenji Fujishima	"The first season of ""24"" introduced to television the idea of an action thriller told in real-time: 24 hours, 24 episodes, one hour per episode. The concept was generally well executed in Season 1, but the second half of the season admittedly did not seem quite as well-paced or well-planned as the first. With elements like Teri Bauer's instant amnesia and Kim Bauer's return to Rick, it seemed obvious that the writers were straining to sustain the already intricate main terrorist plot for the whole season. And yet, despite its imperfections, the whole added up to more than the sum of its parts. It worked as an addictive television thriller, sure; but not only did it also manage subtle political commentary into its storylines, it also managed real humanity and soul amidst its conventional action-thriller elements. And of course there was the calm center of the show, Kiefer Sutherland, who was able to sustain a deft mixture of soulfulness, charisma, and intensity as Jack Bauer for all 24 episodes.The second season of ""24"" could have gone wrong; it could have exacerbated the problems of Season 1's second half and easily become a mess. And yet, Robert Cochran, Joel Surnow, and co. returned with a sophomore season that is, in many ways, even better than the first. There is a confident sweep that amazingly spans the entire season; you really get the feeling that the writers know where the twisty plot is going every step of the way. And---especially when the season aired, during 2002-3, as the U.S. was launching its still-controversial Iraq offensive---Season 2 is even stronger with the topical relevance, as, in the season's latter half, (possible spoiler alert) President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) finds his presidency endangered by a decision he makes regarding a surprise attack and the possibility that it may be based on false intelligence. To those who followed President George W. Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq, the parallels must have seemed uncanny in 2003. Season 2 may be the first season of ""24"" to fully assert its calling card: the fear of terrorism that marks the atmosphere these days is used to ground the Hollywood-thriller action---and occasional outrageous plot twists---of ""24"" in today's reality. Season 2 has more torture scenes than Season 1, but the writers suggest that, under this atmosphere of tension and fear, these are the kinds of methods that may have to be employed in order to keep the country safe.As well-done as Season 2 is, not even this season manages perfection. The storylines involving Kim Bauer (played by Elisha Cuthbert) have gotten a lot of flack from fans, and for understandable reasons: she gets into so much trouble that after a while her sheer bad luck starts to feel impossibly contrived---mere padding, if you will. (Thankfully, Kim wasn't around for Season 4.) Yet, at least Cuthbert herself has the good luck to be involved in what is perhaps the best scene of the entire season: an emotional, heartbreaking scene during the 10PM hour in which father Jack tells her he may not be returning from the field alive.Jack Bauer is perhaps worth a mention too; this is a slightly different Jack from the one seen in Season 1. Apparently, since his wife's tragic death 18 months ago, he's gained a ruthless streak that leads him to act nearly as dirty as the terrorists in trying to save Los Angeles from nuclear annihilation. In other words, it seems to me that Jack Bauer has morphed from a straight action hero into a morally ambiguous anti-hero, one who dirties his hands and does controversial things---like stage the death of a suspected terrorist's son---to get results. Perhaps the subtle transformation is meant to be a commentary by itself: this is what terrorism and the threat of war does to characters like Jack. It's a credit to Kiefer Sutherland that he still manages to make Bauer a compelling, even charismatic lead figure without making him too likable.Dennis Haysbert is also on hand as President David Palmer, and once again he is one of authentically presidential actors you'll ever see. Conviction rings through nearly every syllable of Haysbert's voice; but this is hardly a one-note performance. Haysbert manages to create a convincing portrayal of a president under undue pressure, and not only from the country to protect them from terrorism; members of his own cabinet, it turns out, seem to have it in for Palmer in some way.Other characters pop up from Season 1. Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald), for instance, who was so unceremoniously dismissed by her husband at the end of the first season, returns; so does Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke), who was revealed to be a traitor in the penultimate episode of Season 1 and killed Teri Bauer in the end. It's apparently a small world in the ""24"" universe, but no matter: ""24"" is a show about intelligent thrills, not about absolute realism.I have yet to see the third season of ""24,"" but if it is as messy and uneven as a lot of fans say it is, then Season 2, for me, will stand as the best season of ""24"" so far. As enjoyable as Seasons 1 & 4 was, neither managed the confident forward sweep of this second season, which is so well-executed that it truly does start to feel like one huge epic action film. I can think of no higher compliment for the second season of this fine show. Recommended."	5.0	"No sophomore slump for ""24"""	2005-07-16	3	3	0

We are almost finished with the second season and we can't still figure what the big deal was.It is basically a 2 hour show stretched into 24 episodes with a lot of filler that makes you want to bang your head against the wall.  Very predictable.  Severely over rated.Edit: Finished the season last night.  Not often that I can't wait until a series is over so I don't have to think about it again.  Wife and I were about to fall asleep in the last hour.  Very predictable.  Too many plot items that are contrived and illogical.  Wife would have given it 0 stars.Some annoyances:Someone is shot from a sniper, in a helicopter but didn't here it.Everything is only 15 minutes away.  This was based in LA.

The President (Dennis Haysbert) must rely on Jack's help to prevent WWIII.While the writing is not as good as Season One, this is still the best series on TV.  Kiefer Sutherland is outstanding as the intrepid secret agent who overcomes all adversities with the help of computers, cell phones, and  his trusty CTU pals, Tony and Michelle.  David Palmer and his manipulative ex-wife are back as well, as is Jack's  nemesis from last season, Nina.  Rounding out the superb supporting cast are Jude Ciccolella and Glenn Morshower as Chief of State Mike Novick and Agent Pierce.The weak link this season is the storyline involvong Jack's daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), who is surely the most annoying character on TV.  She's onscreen half of the time and yet nothing she does affects the main plot; she's just a time-filler. Kim is unbelievably stupid, weak, and whiny and I want to fast forward whenever I see her.The production values are high and the series feels like a good feature film.  It's tense and exciting with several shockingly graphic torture scenes.  There are occasional commentaries, deleted scenes, and some behind-the-scenes features.	4.0	Jack Bauer saves the day (again!)	2012-12-29	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AO2PHWLPT3VP5	Leira	~I think Elisha Cuthbert's subplot really helped the show. I mean they needed a filler to make the show last for 24 hours. During the earlier episodes, I found myself thinking I would've done the same thing in Kim's situation. She didn't know what else to do. Everything was moving so fast and all she could think about was keeping Meggan, the girl who she nannied for, safe. She had to make slpit-second decisions. She is young and naive and can't reach her father, Jack(Keifer Sutherland). She is still grieving over the loss of her mother and the trauma she went through a year before, and she doesn't know how much time she has to get out of LA. IF SHE'D HAD MORE TIME, going to the police about Meggan's father's abuse and making other more logical decisions would obviously have been the right way to go. HOWEVER, THE RUSH OF THE SHOW IS THAT THERE IS NO TOMORROW...they are living only in the present and trying to handle their present situation as if this day is all they have and their racing against the clock. Plus, they needed to give Kim something to do and the decisions she makes based on emotion make the show interesting. It's how she tangles herself up in a sticky situation that makes her subplot worth watching. Plus it adds a lot of emotion...between Kim trying to keep the little girl she loves safe...and after not wanting to see her dad yet...now wanting to see him more than ever.~The show as a whole is hard for some people to keep up with. There are so many things going on at once. The suspense is really what makes the show most interesting. You don't get to finish one plot before you go onto the other. At some points I found myself wishing the plots I was more interesting would move along more quickly, but the suspense made me keep watching the show. There were I think 6 or 7 different plots going on at one point.~The first season was a lot more personal. Jack goes through so much emotional and physical stress, and everything's moving along so quickly and he's running out of time. The coolest thing about the show is how he has to fit so much into one day. THERE IS NO TOMORROW is basically how the show is made.~Definately worth watching (in order of course!) If you haven't seen season 1 then don't watch 2 until you have.~I know I'm probably getting all 4 seasons on DVD for christmas. It's worth the money.	4.0	24, season 2 thoughts	2005-11-02	3	1	2

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3KB1H0S7T6JX1	L Gontzes	"An outstanding series, 24 Season Two brings to the screen the parallel stories of (mainly) four characters: Jack Bauer, Kim Bauer, Kate Warner and President David Palmer.The setting is Los Angeles over a year after the events on the day of the Democratic California Primary and Federal (CTU) agent Jack Bauer is trying to thwart an attempt to blow up Los Angeles and start a war in the Middle East. As is the case with this series though, there is much more than meets than eye...Kiefer Sutherland, Sarah Clark (who is GORGEOUS!), Dennis Haysbert, Carlos Bernard, Xander Berkeley (!) and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.The major setbacks are in relation to:1) The attack out of nowhere on Yousouf and Kate Warner at exactly the wrong time.2) It gets worse when Yousouf survives long enough just to tell Jack Kate's address and then dies!!!3) There's also the whole bringing people back from the dead (!!!) in typical soap opera fashion... Shameful!4) And if that wasn't bad enough, then for hours afterwards the ""resurrected"" is as good as new even though he's had holes burned into him, they have cut through him and they have sliced him open.5) The ridiculous capture of Jack when all he had to do is drop the tracker in a waste disposal or slip it in someone's pocket!6) The completely useless daughter that attracts all (literally ALL) weirdos, psychos, and retards.  The actress is very attractive, but the writers have turned her into a complete moron!7) The endless dragging on of her ""ordeal"" and how she screws everything up ALL THE TIME!8) The return of the very annoying Palmer wife and the unlikely path she has chosen.9) The presence of the equally annoying Paula.10) Everything that could (and couldn't or shouldn't) go wrong does go wrong!On the positive side:1) 24 Sheds light on illegal covert operations carried out by cartels and shadow agencies within the government.2) Kiefer Sutherland and Sarah Clark have an amazing chemistry, while Dennis Haysbert and Carlos Bernard were born for their respective roles.3) Good moral story with the president doing the right thing and making the right choices.4) Very original to have the whole series be ""24 hours.""5) A good look into the dirty world of politics.In short, 24 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

If tou ignore any scenes or storylines having to do with caricature of a you g woman, Kim Bauer, his daughter, then its a pretty good show. I do feel that they have some bizarre moral decisiaons made by characters that you are supposed to like, very odd at times. No one seems to have any loyalty to anyone, except of course Jack Bauer and The President. Sure hope it isnt ever like this in real life, but I definitely find myself looking forward to the next episode.	4.0	Good show, sometimes silly but intense	2014-05-23	0	0	0

How many stupid decisions can Kim (his daughter) make in one 24 hour period?  Come on - escaping from the police, only to be caught in a trap and hunted by a mountain lion?!

I have heard many state that the packaging was flimsy or not secure.  I did not have that problem, I was impressed with how neat the packaging of these DVDs were arranged neatly and securely.  The price for this DVD (Slim Pack) is worth it, and of course being a 24 TV series fan, I am again enjoying some of the episodes I missed in the Season 2 series.

From a critical point of view, the story in season one may be better, but I enjoyed season two much more because even though the suspense is still great, the story seems less believable (more James-Bondish style). I also know why they got rid of Jack's wife in season one; it was meant to add a different dimension to Jack's character (single, powerful and decidedly charming) thus giving the story a different twist, injecting it with the subtlest romance.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"I enjoyed season one of this inventive show.  When I found out it had been picked up for another season, the only question left in my mind was ""Will they be able to match the first season?""  When this season started, I had my answer.  They surpassed it with flying colors.Season two picks up a year and a half after season one.  Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is estranged from his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), who has moved out and is working as a nanny.  Jack has also quite his job at the Los Angeles branch of the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU).  That doesn't matter to now President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert).  When the President gets news that there is a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles, he calls Jack to personally ask him to help prevent the disaster.  Reluctantly, Jack agrees to go back to work for CTU to find the bomb before it goes off.  But first, he calls Kim and warns her to get out of LA in case he can't find it in time.  Meanwhile, Kate Warne (Sarah Wynter) is busy getting ready for her sister's wedding.  But something about the groom to be doesn't feel right to her.One idea discussed at the end of season one was going to more self-contained stories.  Fortunately, the producers decided to keep their one day per season real time.  I have seem some argue that the real time format isn't followed as closely this season, but if so, I found no evidence of it.This show builds on the returning characters from season one and even manages to bring back villainesses Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald) and Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) in believable ways.  The story is mostly self-contained, so you could jump in here is you wanted to, but watching season one will help explain all the relationships and increase your enjoyment of the show.  The new characters help build the story of season two, although the Kate sub-plot seems out of place until at least a third of the way through the season when you begin to understand how it fits with everything else.  Kim's sub-plot of trying to leave LA starts out believable, but grows increasingly ludicrous as the day goes by.  The main storyline, however, moves quickly with lots of twists and turns.  Each episode ends with a cliffhanger that will make you want to keep watching.After the success of season one and the DVD release of that season, the producers had more time to plan this DVD set, and it shows.  The twenty-four episodes are preserved on six discs.  Each episode is shown in sharp wide screen and presented in surround sound.  Removing my complaint from season one, the ""Previously on 24"" recap is included, although you can skip over it if you so desire.  Chapter breaks and a play all feature are also included on these discs.  Each disc includes one audio commentary with a member of the cast and crew as well as deleted scenes from the episodes.If that's not enough to make you happy, check out the seventh disc.  It includes all 44 deleted scenes in one place with optional commentary.  In additional, there are two featurettes on the production and post-production of the show.  A third featurette goes into behind the scenes detail on the bombing of CTU from early in the season.Not only did the producers step up the plate with a better over all second season, but the DVD set is better as well.  A few minor sub-plot complaints can't hamper the enjoyment of the thriller that is 24 season two."	5.0	Jack's Back	2005-11-05	13	12	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2DAHERP7HYJGO	Mark Turner	I was not one of those that hooked up with the show 24 during its initial run. Matter of fact, I didn't fall in line for season two either. I felt that I couldn't find the time to make certain I was sitting in front of my television that one particular night each week. Nor could I be certain that I would have a tape ready to go. I now regret that decision.This is one of the most innovative concepts for a television program I have seen in some time. For those not in the know, the show takes place in one hour segments each episode. In other words, it is supposed to happen in real time. The only fault in this is that no one seems to eat or use the bathroom. But we'll forgive that and have no need to view either option.The stories have revolved around two central characters. The first is Jack Bauer (Kieffer Sutherland), an agent of the CTU (Central Terrorist Unit), an espionage agency determined to take down terrorists. Along with Jack we have his backup team and boss as well as his daughter Kim. During the first season, Jack's wife was killed by a terrorist Jack was pursuing, leaving him a broken man and causing him to leave the CTU.The second main character is President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) and the members of Washington based powers that surround him. These include members of his cabinet and his ex-wife Sherry, a power player with her own interest and goals in mind.In the first series, Palmer was running for office and his life was saved by Jack, a man he now trusts implicitly. Then Palmer was running for office. Now as President the story shifts from gaining power to wielding it.The show begins at 8:00AM and the President's vacation plans are interrupted by the news that a terrorists organization has managed to smuggle in a nuclear weapon on US soil. And the bomb is set to go off sometime within the next 24 hours in Los Angeles. Palmer does what he thinks is best. He contacts the CTU and asks that Bauer be brought in to help deal with this problem.Bauer is in the midst of reconciliation with Kim. Meeting her at her new job as a nanny for an upper class LA couple, the pair reunites but has their time cut short by the President. Kim returns to her job only to find that her employer is a wife and child beater. She high tails it with the kid in tow and goes for help.Jack begins reluctantly begins his task of finding the nuke before it can be detonated on the condition that they get his daughter to safety. The promise is made but they can't follow through since she's on the run.Jack uses the most unorthodox methods to find the information he needs, going so far as to....well I won't say. To do so would be to blow one of the many surprises that this show pops out each episode.Along with this story is that of the President discovering that members of his staff are working against him throughout this event. Just who is behind it and who he can trust makes for as suspenseful a story as the Jack's search.All of these story arcs combine to make one stimulating viewing experience. You watch each one, get to the end and can't wait to start the next. I found myself checking the clock as each episode ended, wondering if I couldn't deal with perhaps one more less hour of sleep that night so that I could see what happened next.Everything about this series is fantastic. The direction keeps the flow of the story moving along at breakneck speed, using visual tricks to heighten the suspense. The story itself is a marvel as the threads of each story are combined to make on long narrative. While a TV show may seem like a chapter in a book, this one that runs 24 hours is like reading an entire novel when watched back to back.The acting in this series is some of the best I've seen on the small screen. Sutherland is totally believable in the role of rogue hero that does whatever it takes to get the job done. And Haysbert's performance as the President makes me want to go out and campaign for him tomorrow.Few shows have captured my imagination and enthusiasm like this one has. The last was perhaps THE X-FILES. Now that I've finished with this series, I can't wait for the new fall season to begin.	5.0	Action Filled 24 Hours	2008-03-13	2	1	1

I of course purchased the complete DVD set of season one. The thing about this show is, no matter who you are, you will love it. I introduced 3 of my friends to the show with the season 1 DVD set, and within a week and a half, we had completed the whole thing! They were instantly glued, and forever fans. Now we all are eagerly awaiting season 2 to come out on DVD, and let me tell you, season 2 is even more exciting than the first. With even more action and suspense, and another group of charachters to love, hate, or be skeptical of, season two of 24 is something that all action/suspense/thriller fans should have in their collection.

You remember the times you wanted to be Indiana Jones after seeing that movie?  I want to be like Jack Bauer.  MAybe not to be in all his situations (the torturing) heheI was so moved by Jacks decision to fly the plane with the nuke, and by Mason's decision.  I never thought I would like Mason after the first moments of season one, but his action to fly the plane, talk about heroism.  I mean he was bailing (I think a lot of us would do that, right?) but he came through.  Great characters.  ANd Palmer.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A10CJINP7KBR4W	M. Herzog	This decade has suffered from far too many shows that had a great first season, but started to sink in later seasons.  Luckily, 24 avoided this trap, and produced a second season that was largely better than the first.  The story provided bigger stakes, and was largely more consistent as well as political than the first.  Jack Bauer's character developed, becoming far colder and harsher after the loss of his wife from season 1.  Without going too much into details, I was impressed with the stories, how they interwove, and how they were all linked together.  That is, with the exception of Kim Bauer, Jack's daughter.  This story was boring, bland, detracted from the story, and while it started fairly interesting, got to a point of frustration where I started fast-forwarding as I was so tired of her story (which I have never done in a show before).  I feel the writers wanted to keep the family elements from the first season around, but were having severe difficulty making it work.  That being said, this season was an improvement over an already great first season, which was already pretty great.I think its odd how often a show can have a great first season but fall into the sophomore slump for so many modern shows.  I'm thrilled that 24 avoided falling into this trap and turned out a season that was better on all fronts than the first.  If you enjoyed the first season, you will love the second.	4.0	An Event Better Season, Where Everything Was Turned Up A Notch	2009-12-11	0	0	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3TUZOJZM9008Y	"Michael A. Brown ""maniacmedia"""	Fans of season one wondered how the creative team behind &quot;24&quot; could out do themselves in season two. One nuclear warhead later, that question was satisfied.Jack Bauer, a recluse since the finale of season one, gets a call from now President Palmer. He needs Bauer to thwart a reported terrorist threat. Jack reluctantly rejoins CTU to get the ball rolling. It's another long day for the most dedicated law enforcement professional on the planet. Fortunately, he dies for a few seconds to get some rest.The storyline with daughter Kim stretches the imagination to the breaking point. And, the fact that President Palmer and Jack Bauer never actually are in the same room together never seems to matter.If possible, a stronger season than the first.	5.0	Quality television for the adreniline junkie.	2003-09-28	2	1	1
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	"If you thought the first season was explosive and intense, wait until you get a load of ""24: Season Two.""  Filled with non-stop thrills, chills, excitement, devastating turn-of-events, tragedy and action, this second season proves to be a better success over the first one.  Make sure you've strapped your seatbelt in and prepare for one hell of a ride.It's been well over a year since the horrible events that happened to Jack Bauer and his family.  Not working for CTU anymore, Jack's life is a complete mess because he constantly blames himself for what happened to them.  Things drastically change when he gets a phone call from the President, telling him that there's a nuclear bomb that is set to go off in Los Angeles at any time during the day.  Bauer goes back to work for CTU and is once again faced with a 24-hour catastrophe that could very well bring the next World War.Again, I was hooked right after the first episode and wanted to watch more.  It's great to watch the season for the first time on DVD because you can watch as many episodes as you like.  I don't know if I could just watch one episode a week.  If you thought the first season was a real nail-biter, trust me, you haven't seen anything yet.  The second season offers more twists and turns that will make your body ache in every place.  You're afraid to watch, fearing that the worst could happen... but, you still do.  That's the kind of effect this show has on you.Be warned (again), this is NOT an easy show to watch.  Anything bad you think can happen most likely will.  They do not let you off easy with this show.  You will see some terrible things.  I'm shocked that this isn't on HBO instead of Fox, as I think they get away with a lot of stuff.  Then again, that's what's so great about it.  It literally breaks all of the rules.  The show gets very disturbing and hard to watch.  Just be prepared.The DVD set this time around is EXCELLENT; offering more features than before.  The show is widescreen, which really gives you the impression that you're watching a real movie.  The picture and sound quality is great, especially for a TV show.  Extra features included are over 40 deleted scenes, commentary for selected shows, featurettes and more.  There's even a 7th disk included that is dedicated to bonus material.  A great package, in my humble opinion.""24: Season Two"" is an addicting joy-ride that will leave you sweating and shaking.  It is almost impossible to only watch one episode; you're going to want to watch them all!  ""24"" is really an outstanding show that pushes the envelope every step of the way.  Get ready and expect the unexpected and think the unthinkable.  This is a rough and unpredictable ride that will leave you wanting more."	5.0	The Clock is Ticking...  Again	2003-10-19	7	7	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3T5NSG7LMRY0A	Michael Gmirkin	"Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 1 was good. Season 2 was better, though it still did some ""hokey"" stuff. Still centered a bit too much around Jack's daughter (did they intentionally write her as a ditz?). Nonetheless, this season upped the ante a bit, and was quite satisfying.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials.Season 2 did a much better job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and an added dis of bonus features, including deleted scenes, and featurettes. The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some ""intense"" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all."	5.0	Best show currently in production on Broadcast TV?	2007-02-01	0	0	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AZI0O32W4ZYGH	"Michael Gordon ""Michael Gordon"""	24-Season 2 continues the dramatic national security TV-thriller.  This season presents a terrifying plot:  a nucleur bomb that is planned to be detonated in Los Angeles.  This was a terrifying plot: I actually live there!  The plot runs smoothly and presents situations that are fairly believable -- and some not.  For instance, the series presents an interesting twist:  one is likely to think that the Arab is going to be the principal terrorist, but by the end of the show, it is someone else.  I was quite surprised, and although I wouldn't likely have written the series this way, it still maintained the high standards that were present in the first season.  Every episode is a thrill.	5.0	Terrific Show	2005-10-21	2	2	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1PWJU780B7BWB	"Michael Hamilton ""http://www.free-golf-tip.com"""	After watching the first season, one's expectations are very high for the 2nd season.The plot centers around a terroristic threat of a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.With its trademark cliff hanging endings, this season does not disappoint.  All the positives are there, so I will focus on the 'negatives', as long as all understand the caveat that the positives that are not elaborated on far outweigh the negatives.There seem to be many last second 'saves' in this episode.  You come to expect them.  And there are plot gaps.  I particulary find it amusing that such a highly trained competent staff can make so many huge miscues, such as letting threats escape, never having enough backup, and such.As in season one, the last hour wraps up a whole season in rapid order.  This formula seems to work, though it does lessen the credibility of the previous 23 hours worth of work. More is accomplished in the last hour than in any 8 hour period.I would give it 5 stars, if not for the 'negatives' listed above.Definitely worth watching.  Just plan to watch 4 episodes at a time, as they do leave you yearning for more.	4.0	Season Two of 24	2005-08-09	1	0	1

I'm not wild about Netflix, but after dealing with Amazon I'm starting to come around.  There is nothing intuitive about browsing, you have to start from square one every time you want to watch a new episode, I'm hearing impaired and you can't add subtitles after the show has started and most importantly you get kicked off, it doesn't stream and sometimes it just won't work and you can't figure out why.  The only thing that impresses me about Amazon is that they would actually go to market with a service that is this inferior.  That takes real courage.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland) is still recovering from the death of his wife and the events that took place in season 1. He no longer works for the CTU, and he is trying to move on with his life by rebuilding a solid relationship with his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert). Unfortunately, a terrorist threat has been announced, and over the course of the next 24 hours, a nuclear bomb is going to be detonated in Los Angeles. David Palmer ( Dennis Hayworth) is now president, and is faced with the challenge of containing the threat. The only person Palmer can turn to is obviously Jack Bauer- the man who saved his life. Now Jack must become the man he once was, and find out who is behind the nuclear bomb before it is too late...I was originally very skeptical when it came to season 2 of Fox's ground-breaking show &quot;24&quot;. Season 1 had incredible acting, nail-biting suspense, and a totally original format of airing each episode as an hour over the course of one day. I figured there was no way that FOX could pull off a second season that even came close. However, the show managed to become even better for season 2. The plot behind season 2 really hits home because of the events of 9/11. Another thing that was great, was the fact that season 2 managed to build off of the previous season when it came to the characters. Even though season 1 was based on a different set of events, the emotional fall out from that day is carried over into season 2, because of how great the acting was. Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Hayworth, Elisha Cuthbert, Carlos Bernard ( Tony Almeida), Sarah Clarke ( Nina Myers), and Penny Johnson ( Sherry Palmer) are all back and are all fantastic. In fact, it was one of the most well rounded performances from a cast I have ever seen.The second season was even better than the first season in my opinion. However, the show was not the only thing that improved. The DVD itself took a complete 180 when it came to the special features that were offered. The first season DVD set did not really have any special features at all, or even any scene selection. The second time around, FOX made sure to correct their mistake. First of all, there is actually scene selection. You do not have to manually skip through the whole episode just to find a particular scene. The special features are great as well. The show itself fits over six discs. However, a seventh disc was created that contains nothing but extras. There are 44 deleted scenes, three incredible featuretes, and much more. If you were a fan of the first season, there is definately no way you can afford to pass this up. A must buy!!	5.0	Season 2 of &quot;24&quot; on DVD is amazing!!!	2003-11-05	202	183	19

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A56CWHZ5AEGX3	M. Lachance	Season 2 of 24 was incredible.  As much as I enjoyed Season 1, I though Season 2 was even better.  Kiefer Sutherland is sensational as Jack Bauer.  Jack Bauer is a complex character and Kiefer Sutherland plays him brilliantly.  He at first seems like a machine - and then you see the softer side - mind you not for long.Season 2 had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  Season 3 and 4 were terrific also.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AQQ3A3IMK1PWS	M. MacDonald	Two weeks ago I went into a large electronics store and they were giving away a free DVD with the first 2 episodes of 24 season 2 as a promotion for the boxed set being released. I had never watched the show, but it seemed really interesting to me. One night I threw in the free DVD and watched the 2 episodes. From that point on I was hooked.A couple days later I was home from work sick and I asked my wife to pick up the entire season 2 box set. By the time I felt better and went back to work I had watched the whole thing. I now wonder if I could of watched it on TV having to wait a whole week between episodes.All in all the entire season was excellent. My only complaint would be the story line with Jack Bauer's daughter, Kim Bauer. About half-way through the season I found her storyline to be so unbeleivable that I didn't really care what happened with her. However the other story lines were so good it didn't really matter.If you are a fan of the show, you don't need this review. If you have never seen the show and are thinking about purchasing it - do it! I highly doubt you will be disappointed.-Mike from Dayton	5.0	I'm Hooked	2003-09-26	45	42	3
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	ASK1XT4U7R4KK	M. Morski	"In the first season, you were given an option of ""View all"".  With this you could conveniently watch all the episodes on that DVD.  The 2nd season (and the 3rd season) do not give you this option.  After the first episode on a dvd, I tried everything to get back to the menu.  Nothing worked.  I ended up having to:  1.  Stop the DVD.  2. Eject the DVD.  3. Reinsert the DVD.  4.  Start the DVD and skip over the warnings, etc., to get to the menu.  5.  Select the next episode from the menu.  This is extremely irritating and time consuming.  It would help if whoever makes these DVD's would make it more convenient for buyers of this series to access the episodes."	3.0	Annoying to Access Episodes	2009-06-18	1	0	1
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C	M. Newton	"24 is an outstanding series.  The action is non-stop, the acting is generally very good, the sets are amazing, and the characters are almost all deep and interesting.  This show is extremely entertaining and very addictive.  You'll want to own the entire season, so you can watch multiple, commercial free episodes at each sitting.However, this season seemed to have a lot more ridiculous scenes than season 1.  While I expected some ""unlikely"" things to happen, the writers let things go a little too far too often.  We have plane crash walkaways and flatline recovery among other implausible scenes.  Given the quality of the series, you'll probably want to ""check your brain at the door"" and just enjoy the show, as I did.I do wish they would eliminate his pitiful daughter, Kim.  Whenever the show focused on her, I used the opportunity to fix a drink or a snack.  She brings nothing to the show and is in fact very frustrating to watch.  While her scenes are also highly improbable, they fail to be entertaining.The rest of the characters are great, and I think that just about everyone can enjoy this show.  The DVD has some good extras and is not too expensive when you consider the many hours of entertainment in the box."	5.0	Great, but less so than Season 1	2006-03-27	7	7	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1E15WYG9C47X1	"""mobby_uk"""	I must admit that I did not expect the second season of 24 to be as exciting and thrilling as the first, and I had my doubts especially since it was using the same formula of real time events unfolding over the course of one day,and hence the originality factor that made the first season such a success is not there.Moreover, many friends have advised me that indeed Jack Bauer's second adventure was weaker.Yet two things I have learned after years of a passionate appreciation of cinema and good TV:Never let other opinions or reviews influence your own judgment, andNot being quite original does not mean a bad thing a all, if the writing, acting and direction are good enough to pull it off.So, watching the second season of 24, I was totally captivated from the very first hour till the very last..Indeed I found the second series of 24 to be far better in many ways, and this is why..First of all the familiarity with most of the characters ensured that the viewer sympathizes/connects with them from the very start, as opposed to taking maybe few 'hours' to be totally involved as with the original.Secondly, the writing was superb:While the first, despite the nail biting tension, twists and suspense, had a very simple and straightforward plot, an eye for an eye personal revenge, the second expands the possibilities much more, and delves into very dark and dangerous grounds, both on a international terrorism and domestic conspiracies levels. The writing is so good in fact that you will be excused in believing even for mere seconds, that you are watching more than the entertaining fiction that it really is.All actors involved are excellent, but I am surprised no one has mentioned one particular actor who was instrumental in lifting this second series up, and infusing a lot of humanity albeit tragic, and that is Xander Berkeley.He, in my opinion, gives the performance of his career , as does Berkeley's real life missus the lovely Sarah Clarke, who makes a comeback, and is chillingly transformed into this cold blooded assassin and traitor that we only saw few glimpses of in the closing minutes of the first season.Dennis Haysbert aka David Palmer now president,is not only a very able actor who added a lot of dignity and class to his role, but I must admit he makes one helluva president too!!!The twists and suspense in the second season never lapse for one second, up until the very last minute, which leaves the door open for lots of possibilities for the third season.I liked the fact that the plot in the second season was evenly divided into two sections, connected smoothly over these crucial 24 hours.. The hunt, against the clock for the nuke and the conspiracy inside Washington, and the shadowy men behind it all.Of course, the second series has its minor flaws: the sub plots involving the gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert were somehow weak in comparison to everything that was going on ..(a psycho abusive father, the loner nut case in the woods, the over the top deranged Latino father-to-be in the store..).All credit should go to all people involved in this wonderful series for the collective effort that has been put to produce quality television that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, for 24 hours and more!

Jack Bauer and CTU are OFF THE CHAIN!  The citizens of the USA inside the world of this wonderfully crafted drama should be very proud of how their tax dollars are spent on protecting their lives and constitution.Well...there are a few times where the Constitution does get shredded like yesterday's incriminating email though...ALL in the auspices of national security nonetheless!

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A5GLCE7D376ZK	M. Salankey	"Of all of the seasons of 24, this one contains the smallest amount of intelligent writing and plotlines.  Many of the subplots are gimmicky and poorly written at best.  The cliffhanger endings and attempts at being ""spontaneous"" at the end and beginning of every show are overabundant and weak.  Most of all, everything involving Kim Bauer makes me want to throw my TV out the window.  The stories involving her and the psychotic, abusive parent of Megan, the hermit with the bomb shelter and the moron who holds up the liquor store.  How is it that she always gets into trouble, again and again and again?  It's ridiculous, and it goes to ridiculous lengths.In terms of ""far-fetchedness,"" I believe this season bests even the incontrovertable Season 4 in terms of poor writing.  Of all the people in the Warner family subplot a viewer expects to be a terrorist, it turns out to be the last one of them anybody would expect.  She promptly kills 2 CTU agents AND her fiance without even hesitating.  She almost kills her own sister.  I still chuckle when people find that to be less far fetched than the myriad events of Season 4.  Somehow, some way, every effort Jack makes is undermined by some ridiculous and unbelievable happening.  He is flatline for like 6 total minutes, withstands pain that would cripple almost any human being, yet 3 hours later he is just fine, no sign of any duress.  Every link Jack finds is broken, or killed, or circumvented by chain of command crap that delivers nothing but frustration, not the intended drama, as I watch the show.  Overall, expect some superficial thrills from the action involving the nuke, but the last 8 episodes are complete garbage."	3.0	My least favorite	2006-02-16	14	14	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AP50P603W4BA7	"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums"""	Series 2 of this 'real time' thriller is every bit as good as the first one if not better. Jack Bauer is back, although no longer in control of the CTU (counter terrorist unit). This time Los Angeles is threatened by a nuclear bomb and Jack has only a few hours to find it. Jacks old enemy George is back and is now his boss and David Palmer is also back as the President of the USA.With as many twists and turns as the original series, this keeps you guessing from start to finish. You just think you've figured the plot out and who the bad guy is, only to find you're completely wrong and its back to the drawing board.

Season 2--really felt like a group of writers who had already shot their load.  The whole storyline with Kim Bauer, as most of the reviewers have reported, had absolutely nothing to do with nothing and was nowhere in the realm of believabilty.  Plus,was it just me, but did the story just fold in on itself after the bomb went off in like episode 16?  The Warner storyline was the most interesting-but again, after the explosion, even that went away.  I like the actor Dennis Haysbert (Are you in good hands?) but the whole 25th Amendment angle was laughable.  I hear the seasons get better after this one, so I'm going to continue trudging on, but I don't know if I could go through another season like this one.	3.0	Real disappointment	2007-06-25	16	15	1

Saiz ""Norma Saiz"""	Kiefer Sutherland plays a darker and deeper role of Jack than its first season and it shows alot in the weaving plot, in and out in and out. Although nothing, I mean nothing, can stop this rollercoaster from coming to a halt because every minute of this worst-day-ever is filled with punches, yells, and shocks to make you glued to the screen every episode after the other. A very unique way of camera movement, this series plots to revenge against terroists. Jack is, as always, the hero of every cause and the man who makes the decision in this house. Kiefer shows so much more character in this season as he takes on mind-blowing acting skills to potray a more violent and more controlling Jack Bauer. If you loved the first season, like I did, you will defenitly not be dissapointed in the second season of the groundbreaking series. This show features more turns and shocks than anything on TV and its that is what will keep your attention; every second, every minute,a and ever hour of this hell of a day and hell of a series.	5.0	A 24-hour Thrill ride.	2003-12-28	2	2	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AZC5EBJFOKPXQ	NYCShopper	I didn't have the schedule to follow &#34;24&#34; when it aired. But it's become such an enduring cultural touchstone, features a parade of good actors (Dennis Haysbert!), and is so conveniently streaming on Prime, that I decided to dive in.  I am amazed at just how bad it is.&#34;24&#34; is poorly written. When you watch the episodes in blocks (OK, binges), the shallowness of the characters, and the repetitiveness of the story-lines, situations and dialog all become painfully evident.Season 1 started out with a decent amount of drama and suspense, but soon, the constant unfurling of horrible events became monotonous. Season 2 was preposterous, with the writers resorting  to episodes filled with violence-porn and far-fetched situations full of plot holes... no, plot canyons...all depending on Jack Bauer to resolve.OH, and in perusing the reviews here on Amazon, I see I'm not the only one who kept thinking, &#34;No functional adult would make such a ridiculous decision,&#34; or who was astonished by the Darwin Award-worthy judgment-impairment of Jack's daughter, Kim.There ARE lessons to be learned from this show, however.  Here are a few key principles:- Women are conniving, evil, or wildly self-absorbed--unless they are admirers of Jack Bauer;- Even the most treacherous men have soft spots--usually evinced by a dawning realization of Jack Bauer's greatness;- Torture is good when it's inflicted by Jack Bauer or President Palmer (whose rectitude is demonstrated by his unwavering admiration for Jack Bauer), and bad when it's inflicted--in pretty much the same way--by anyone else.-On one hand, unless it's Jack Bauer or an admirer of his giving the orders, chain of command is restrictive, petty and wielded by people who are corrupt or inept.  On the other hand, unless you're Jack Bauer or his admirer President Palmer, thinking for yourself or acting on your own always leads to unbelievably terrible outcomes...which Jack Bauer will promise to fix.My first instinct was to give this show one star, except that there is something I have to confess:  in spite of how laborious it is, and of how much eye-rolling I've done watching it,  &#34;24&#34; is clearly addictive.  I am, after all, writing this review having watched 48 episodes that I could not stop myself from watching.  So, for that I'll give it an extra star, but ask if anyone knows of a meeting nearby.	2.0	Misogynistic, repetitive, replete with improbabilities, full of silly or hateful conclusions	2014-04-24	2	2	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	The 24 collection is a worthy hobby and is certainly growing to be one of largest of the television series DVD anthologies. There are currently six seasons and season seven is planned for 2009. Each season has 6 discs, with 4 episodes per disc. Each episode covers approximately 1 hour of real-time drama although there are breaks for television advertising time meaning each episode lasts for about 45 min. To date there is approximately 6 days worth of 24 viewing. Each season is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next 24 days. It has won Emmy and Golden Globe awards. It has already achieved some of highest viewer rates for any television show. The discs are held in a cardboard and plastic flip holder. It slides into the slim line box. It is not that easy to remove but this increases the security of the discs. The sound is in 5:1 Dolby Digital and the show is shot in 1.78 : 1.The real-time nature makes it unique along with its split screen type editing where more than one scene can take place at a time. There is also the clock with its ominous digital ticking that seems more like a countdown even though it is moving forward in time. 24 Season 2 is incredible television. If you had to select the best seasons from any TV series then 24 Season 2 would easily rank up there. It is maybe the best TV action season you can own. So that says a lot. Also it mimics the mindset and politics back in 2003 with respect to post-911 events and the war in Iraq. It is dead-on interesting in hindsight to see Season 2 with respect to the current situation.24 season 2 is mostly about Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) who has left CTU (counter-terrorist unit) because of his wife's demise. Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) is now in office. Bauer's daughter Kim is working as a child minder for a rich but dangerous businessman. CTU learns that there is an atomic bomb about to go off in L.A today. Each episode becomes an edge of your seat thriller with lots of plot twists and character turns. From the bomb chase, to double-crossing, to NSA internal problems, torture, going to war, intelligence reports gone bad and a cabinet that is split on removing the President from office. Can Jack Bauer find a nuclear device, prove the intelligence reports wrong, save the President's career and the millions of people in LA in less than 24 hours? There hasn't been an action season like it!Overall the show has very high production values and the transfer quality of season 2 is exceptionally better than season 1 which was one of the early DVD TV releases and so sometimes the widescreen bars produced fluffy edges. Well that's gone now. Although at times the suspension of disbelief is sometimes stretched to the maximum (how many times can they accidentally stumble onto something?) you will still you be hard pressed to find better TV that is non-stop rush of action and suspense. Give it a go and see if you want to enjoy some more. The 24 fever is well worth it.Oh yeah and guess how many episodes there are?	5.0	Season 2 is one of the best TV seasons of all time, you will be glad you got into 24	2009-01-12	1	1	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	The first season of the genre-defining action-thriller &iexcl;24&iexcl; was a landmark of taught suspense, thrilling action, and inventive story telling.  Every single one of the 24 hours had viewers on the edge of their seats as they watched Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) agent Jack Bauer race against time to prevent the assassination of presidential candidate David Palmer and rescue his family from terrorists who wanted him dead.  Each episode was filled to the brim with depth and detail.  There were no wasted movements.  Whether it was David Palmer battling treachery within his own campaign or Jack Bauer uncovering another mind-bending twist the conspiracy, &iexcl;24&iexcl; produced some of the best, movie-quality TV to come along in years.  The thought on everyone&iexcl;s mind was, &iexcl;Is &iexcl;24&iexcl; a one-trick pony, or does it have legs for a second season that is as good at the first.&iexcl;  Fortunately for fans of Jack Bauer, David Palmer, and the show&iexcl;s unique format, the answer is an unqualified &iexcl;Yes!&iexcl;The end of Season One left Jack Bauer exhausted and heartbroken as, despite his best efforts, he could still not prevent the murder of his wife, Teri.  Interim literature such as Marc Cerasini&iexcl;s &iexcl;Findings at CTU&iexcl; reveals that Bauer left CTU not long after events of that day.  He is estranged from his daughter, Kim, and is just struggling to keep himself from ending it all.  Palmer, of course, went on to win the Presidency and is now faced with the worst crisis the Chief Executive could face, this side of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor.  Intelligence sources have revealed, with high confidence, that a fully armed nuclear bomb is set to be detonated in downtown Los Angeles at some point during that day.  CTU&iexcl;s best agents are on the case attempting to find the location of the bomb, but there is only one man who has both the background to find the bomb and President Palmer&iexcl;s utmost confidence in his ability to get the job done.  That man is Jack Bauer.  Sympathetic to Bauer&iexcl;s struggles, but in dire need of his help, Palmer speaks directly to Jack and enlists the help of current CTU director, George Mason, to get him back in the fold.  Upon realizing the weight of the task at hand, Jack agrees to return to active duty at CTU and embark on what would prove to be the second longest day of his life.My initial fear was that the plotting wouldn&iexcl;t be as tight and that it wouldn&iexcl;t generate the same level of intense emotion as the first season.  The first couple of episodes of Season Two do actually move slower than in Season, but soon the action picks up and &iexcl;24&iexcl; returns to the same level of quality it showed in its debut.  The richness of detail and depth of plotting are as prevalent as in the first season and perhaps even more so this year.  In addition the plot to detonate the nuclear bomb there is more of Kim getting into trouble, scheming within David Palmer&iexcl;s administration, plots against CTU, and subplot where suspicions that the Arab-born fianc of WASP-ish woman may be involved in the bomb plot come to the fore on the day of their wedding.  As much as I wish I could, I cannot reveal any more details about this season, lest viewing experience being ruined for you.  I should add, however, that in addition to be being a great overall season, one of its episodes (Episode 15, 10:00 pm C 11:00 pm) is one grittiest most dramatic television episodes I have ever seen on TV.  Its excellence rates it right up the annals of television history with &iexcl;Abyssinia, Henry&iexcl; from M*A*S*H and &iexcl;Love&iexcl;s Labour&iexcl; from ER.  You will understand when you see it.  Without a doubt, &iexcl;24: Season Two&iexcl; is as good, if not better, than the original &iexcl;24&iexcl;.	5.0	Wow!

It actually works alright, but you have to remember, each time, to do it.  Be careful...They could've, at least, included a ""Play All"" feature for each disc.Anyway, the only problem I had with Season 2 was with Kim Bauer (Jack's daughter).

Twenty minutes into the first show I saw, (somewhere between episodes 13 and 16), I was hooked and had to buy Seasons one and two to see it from the beginning. There is so much intense drama and plot twists and turns. The entire cast is very talented and the writers are amazing. My favorite thing to watch are the many subtle expression changes on Kiefer's face. His talent is solid.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1K4VAYQQLNFVS	"""peterdao"""	After a very loooong wait since the last episode of Season One, I've just spent almost a week to watch Season Two from beginning to end and realized I made a good decision to wait for the DVD set instead of watching &quot;24&quot; week by week on TV. As most other viewers have pointed out, this show is definitely getting better and better, and given the way Season Two was concluded I can't wait to see how the David Palmer/Jack Bauer story continues in the next season.  I know I'll miss Xander Berkeley whose character George Mason has been written off...  I'll also miss Sarah Clarke (Berkeley's real life wife) because Fox wouldn't have Nina Myers come back in Season Three...  But it's fun to know that Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert) will be getting directly involved with CTU's plot plans so she won't keep annoying people as Jack's airhead daughter who by making all the wrong choices has caused too much trouble to everyone else in an irrelevant way...  But most of all, as Season Three begins, I can't wait to see Andrea Thompson. I really hope they'll write a great script for her character. I've been missing her a lot since her latest and brief appearance on CNN's Headline News.	5.0	I'll miss Sarah Clarke but can't wait to see Andrea Thompson	2003-10-30	8	7	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AER15RIMV8E6D	Pumpkin Man	I've been going back and re-watching the older seasons to get ready for Jack's epic comeback in 2014. Season 1 is still my favorite, but season 2 had a much darker tone and was very fast paced. The element of torture was introduced. A year after Jack saves David Palmer and loses his wife, he's retired from CTU. A threat of a nuclear bomb brings Jack out of retirement and forced to help CTU and President Palmer find the bomb before it explodes in Los Angeles. Throughout the course of the day, Kim must deal with her abusive boss, George Mason becomes infected by radiation, Jack comes face-to-face with Nina Myers, and much more! I highly recommend 24: DAY 2!!!	4.0	A Much Darker Season!!!	2013-10-06	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1EMDSTJDUE6B0	Randy Given	This is not quite as good as season one, but still one of the best shows of the season (along with &quot;West Wing&quot;). Unfortunately, we did not watch season one or season two DURING the regular season because of time conflicts with other shows, but chose to fly through them when the DVD sets came out. This makes it seem more like a 16-hour movie, but well worth it.The first two-thirds of the second season live up to the expectations from the first season. Then, it limps along until the last episode or two. Still, not poor enough to lower the rating a full star, so it gets five stars.	5.0	Another Excellent Season	2003-11-18	1	1	0

When I first started watching season two, I didn't expect the same kind of rollercoaster ride I got before.After the first couple episodes of season two, I was hooked all over again.  The writers did a marvelous job once again of capturing the audience and throwing twists left and right.  A lot of the new characters were very good as well, such as Kate Warner, Michelle Dessler, ect.  And George Mason is a much bigger factor this season than the previous.I would have to say that I enjoyed season two even more than season one.  Jack Bauer never dissapoints.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	Executive-produced by its star, Kiefer Sutherland (who has made one of the most remarkable comebacks for an actor in recent history), &quot;24&quot; took a unique and innovative idea---film an entire day, hour by hour, over an entire season---and, instead of using it as a gimmick, let it be the starting pad for one of the most suspenseful, interesting, exciting, disturbing, engrossing and best dramatic series in TV history. This show has never let up from the beginning, and has only become more riveting ever since. In Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) Agent Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland has created a truly complex hero, and has deservingly revived his once-promising career that had been sagging for over a decade.The first season, which I got on DVD last year, concerned a double-whammy threat: An assassination plot against Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (played nobly by veteran African-American actor Dennis Haysbert) and the kidnapping of Jack Bauer's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) and, eventually his wife Teri (Leslie Hope). Along the way, subplots are interwoven cleanly into the proceedings, such as Sen. Palmer's ambitious, scheming Lady MacBeth of a wife Sherry (Penny Johnson Jerald) and Jack Bauer's enigmatic colleague, and former lover, Agent Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke). The entire first season was a high-caliber rollercoaster ride all the way to its shocking and completely unpredictable conclusion.Season Two promised a no-less-intense rollercoaster ride as it concerned the threat of a nuclear bomb about to be set off in Los Angeles. Beginning 18 months after the events of the previous season's day, a much-embittered Jack Bauer is called upon by President David Palmer to help save the day. At the same time, Jack is highly concerned about keeping Kim out of the potential blast area. Unfortunately, it won't be easy for her as she is a live-in nanny to the young daughter of an abusive father. Also at the same time, a rich business owner named Bob Warner is about to marry off his younger daughter Marie to his trusted employee, a young British-raised Arab-American man named Reza, whom is suspected of being involved with terrorists by Bob's elder daughter, Kate Warner (Sarah Wynter). All of these plot threads come together, in ways that are completely surprising, exciting, suspenseful and spellbinding.Bottom line: If you loved Season One of &quot;24&quot; then you're gonna LOVE Season Two. It rocks!!MOST RECOMMENDED	5.0	It Just Keeps Getting Better &amp; Better!!!!	2004-05-05	6	6	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2KXYGIZI4I55D	Romulus	"I'll save you a plot summary, obviously you can get that from the other 200 reviews written here. I will simply state my unworthy opinion. Let me just say that 24 made me believe in television again. After the X-files went down the drain and even Voyager got stupid on me and then with the horrible disgrace that is Enterprise entering the picture I swore I would never be faithful to an American TV series again. The suspense and unbelievable endings in this series are above the standards of most films and light years ahead of all current television. Season One, from start to finish never disappointed me, save for Teri Bauer. I'm sorry about it but she was just damned annoying. Kim seems to have followed in her mother's footsteps in this Season. She herself is not annoying but the writers just seem to put her in the most unbelievable and absurd situations in the entire series. I have seen all three seasons and I have to say that Season two is the low point. But it is still way better than anything else that is on television.Jack's rash actions in the first episode just seem to be there to bring back the old flame of his malicious, unrelenting character. What he does has little affect on the people he was trying to impress and is forgotten completely. The writers are at their very best in the President Palmer storyline. Damn, I wish he was our president. Anyhow, the way Palmer handles the situation before and especially after the Season's major mid-season climax provides a perfect foil for the blunders of the current administration as sort of dramatic ""what-should-have-been-done-in-the-first-place-you-jug-earred-baboon"" scenario. Also, after the early gaining of the audience's trust in unbelievable climaxes, the characters REALLY get a great chance to develop. I wouldn't mind seeing a version which edited out Kim save for her scenes with Jack. I don't think she is a bad actress, she just is in a lot of bad scenes and as an actress, she does a good job of putting on a good face in those idiotic situations. But honestly, the guy with the bomb shelter, the cougar scare, the Convenience store fiasco was all very horrible. It will make you wince and instinctively reach for the remote to fast forward to non-Kim parts. I felt the same during the amnesia episode with Teri Bauer in the first season. That dumb, blank look on her face made me want to scream.

I never thought they had it in them to be who they are but they strike the right chord everytime.Summary-It has everything that you loved about the first season and will like about the third season but the Kim subplot is REALLY, REALLY BAD.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A12DLJESJKM1OQ	Roy Chan	Pros: Starts well, ends decently, the middle, though, is a big mess, Kiefer Sutherland, Penny Johnson, Dennis Haysbert, Sarah Clarke, and maybe Elisha Cuthbert, Amazing show, Beautiful Audio/Video transfer, Highly suspenseful, intelligent, and engrossing show. The acting and writing are both terrific. Novel idea, suspenseful plot with interesting and realistic characters, beautiful transfer, sound.Cons: Loses focus, badly cast supporting roles, not enough ideas to go around, Plot holes and side tracks! A few stumbles, the time laps seems impossible such as jack and many characters doing many things in 1 hour, which is impossible in our real society today.To me, I found that 24 season 1 is far much better than 24 season 2. But despite that, Overall, I would give it a 4.8 for 24 season 1 and 4.3 for 24 season 2!	5.0	The Pros and Cons for 24 Season 2!	2003-06-13	61	18	43

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3081Z4P774YR4	"""rsmon77"""	"After such a surprisingly good first season (and one heckuva finale to boot), I had good expectations for the second season of ""24"".  After the first episode of year two, I had my expectations raised considerably.  Avoiding the ""sophomore slump"" most new TV shows tend to fall into, ""24"" managed to still be entertaining, and by no means boring.  After the tragic finale of season one, Jack Bauer (played to award-winning perfection by Kiefer Sutherland) finds himself isolated and unwilling to go back to work for the Counter-Terrorist Unit.  So it's with surprise that President David Palmer (played to award-deserving perfection by Dennis Haysbert), the man whose life he saved last season calls him for help to find a nuclear bomb which is believed to go off in Los Angeles before the end of the day.  He takes the assignment, but before its over, he will face off against terrorists, an old ally turned traitor, and certain death (over and over again).  This concept (24 hours=24 episodes) could easily fall flat on its face, but is held together by a solid ensemble cast and crew, incredible twists and turns, and unbeliveably relevant drama.  The seven-disc set is a new bar for TV on DVD, boasting several commentaries, nearly an hour of deleted scenes, a great two-part documentary on the last episodes of the season, and a look the work it takes to make those slick split-screen sequences.  All in all, a better than average collection for a solid season of great drama and action (And if you're not waiting for season three after this, I'd honestly recommend checking your pulse)."	5.0	"""24"": Season Two"	2003-09-13	2	2	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AK7IDQJN31163	Ryan	...And the countdown is on!  One of the compelling themes that runs through 24 is the idea that someone, somewhere, is always running out of time.  That's a notion that we can all identify with on many levels.  Throw in a nuclear bomb scheduled to be detonated somewhere in Los Angeles, a group of renegade terrorists who control the bomb and a retired agent with a tragic past, and you've got a recipe for suspense, action and the unexpected.  The major strength of 24 has always been its ability to be twisted and unpredictable.  Although some of the surprises aren't as shocking as those in the first season of the show, there are more than enough to ratchet up the tension in this drama until the viewer's nerves become taught with anticipation.  Kiefer Sutherland proved himself a top-notch actor in the first season of this unique series and he returns as Federal Agent Jack Bauer.  Bauer is a man haunted by his own demons; the tragic death of his wife and the estrangement of his daughter Kim.  The last thing he wants to do is help his old friends at CTU with another mission.  But he can't bring himself to say no to President David Palmer when he is asked to help hunt down a nuclear bomb somewhere in L.A.  Jack is dragged into the middle of it all and finds himself working undercover with a McVeigh-like group of domestic terrorists, a path that will ultimately lead him to a forced alliance with his arch nemesis, Nina Myers (Sarah Clark), the traitor who killed Jack's wife in the explosive finale of season one.  The scenes between jack and Nina are probably the most electrifying and intense during the course of the day.  Once they worked as partners and lovers, and now they must track down the bomb with an ever-present sense of murderous ferocity between them.  Meanwhile, Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), must deal with a conspiracy within his own administration, lead by those who seek to remove him from power any way they can.  Things become more complicated when Palmer's duplicitous ex wife, Sherry (Penny Johnson Jerald), arrives on the scene claiming to have information that will help the President during this crisis.  Other familiar faces return from the first season, including the rye Tony Almeda (Carlos Bernard), the loyal Mike Novick (Jude Ciccolella) and the apathetic George Mason (Xander Berkeley).  Mason was a minor character during the previous season, but his role in this day's events becomes important as he is forced to face his own destiny.  We also meet a young lady who is about to marry a Middle Eastern businessman who may or not be a terrorist.  The weakest plot thread throughout Day Two involves Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert).  Many fans found her exploits annoying during the first season when she was more central to the story, but during this day of building terror, she seems to serve as little more than filler as she tries to help a little girl flea Los Angeles and her abusive father.  The purpose of the writers seems to be to put Kim in every conceivable terrifying scenario, from a hostage situation in a convenience store to an unexpected encounter in the woods with a cougar.  Still, while they are irritating, the Kim story line doesn't detract from the excellent suspense of the other major plots as Jack hunts down the nuclear bomb and tries to prevent a war from being waged by the U.S. in the Middle East.  The real-time format in which each episode represents one hour in this day-long period may create implausibility at times, but its easy to forgive the writers when the tension is razor sharp.The extras in this DVD package are superb and are far superior to the meager offerings of the Season One set.  We are given 44 deleted scenes that can be branched into the shows, episode commentary from all major stars and producers and three behind-the-scenes documentaries that take up an entire bonus disk.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is in clear Dolby 5.1 dynamics.  Many fans have compared the two seasons and there seems to be a split decision as to which one is better.  While I personally lean a bit more toward season one as the better story offering, both seasons are excellent and I encourage every viewer to check out both packages and decide for yourself.  Whether you prefer season one or two, you won't be disappointed with either.  It is well worth the money you would invest to own the box set.  Once you start watching, you won't be able to stop.  Like the previous season, 24 is one hell of a wild ride from start to finish.	5.0	Day Two: Countdown to Destruction	2003-09-13	25	20	5

While seasons 1 and 2 are not the best in the 24 series they are still great to watch, or re-watch. Amazon instant video allows for hard core binge watching which is such a great way to watch a show like this. If you haven't seen 24 before its an absolute must watch. If you have seen it before then go ahead and kill a few days bingeing on a season. This show is all about drama, action and suspense; so if that's your thing then I highly recommend this series.	5.0	Only gets better	2013-04-28	0	0	0

Bauer not only volunteers to give his life by personally flying the bomb into the desert and allowing it to explode safely, but survives only to be tortured then confront the syndicate leader, all the while being opposed by pencil necked blue suits from &#34;district&#34;.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3H8PVQG3IW4JU	Sho Uesugi	"Popular reviews on Amazon are normally those that go with the flow. So I don't expect this to be popular.I avoided watching this show years ago when it first aired because just from the buzz it received, I felt like it was too over the top and unrealistic to be of interest to me. However, someone gave me the 2nd season as a gift and I decided to watch it while working.Alfred Hitchcock was quite astute when he identified the ""suspension of disbelief"" as a key component to keep any drama believable - particularly those that involved ""suspense"". 24 does the opposite, and for a purpose. While not overtly political in tone, the show not-so-subtle message smuggles in a range of stereotypes, and situations that are both contrived and ludicrous in their intensity and repetition.As opposed to the real world where Islamic terrorists are not supported by a ""right wing"" conspiracy, in 24, that's the name of the game. The ideal Obama-like President is being undermined by secret cabal of -- get this -- American business, oil and military interests, that want to push him into various middle eastern wars. And to accomplish this, they are prepared to bomb or risk bombing a major American city with a nuke. You heard me - the ahem...Republicans are out to nuke us, because we need oil. Sound familiar?It get's better. Blond, spoiled valley girls are part of the conspiracy, because they have fallen for mysterious middle eastern men in the past and their love brought them to the point of wanting to murder millions. In between ""likes"" and ""whatevers"", we hear Arabic in hushed tones, plans to destroy our civilization. Just so we can see that even Alicia Silverstone could indeed become a terrorist. Just because it hasn't happened, does not mean that it won't tomorrow. This is what passes for believability on 24.ALL ethnic/gender groups and skin shades portrayed in this series are a caricature of a caricature. The aggressive, irrational latino who is both kind hearted but shoots everyone is sight. The right wing hunter hick, in the forest, in a cabin, with a bomb shelter who wants to abduct cute blond girls and keep them prisoner. The fat, rude 7-11 operator who care nothing for his fellow man, just twinkies. The two catty females who work together but hate each other, and bring the naive man into their little game (women can't be assertive, rational in the ""24"" universe, without being ""b-tchy""). The black lady who is domineering with a ""street-vibe"", sexual and sassy like something off of the old sitcom 227. The out of control hyper-aggressive hippy white man in Bauer that is out to save the world from...like everything...without any semblance of rationality except that everyone is somehow wrong and out to get him, and everyone else. The new type of James Bond, without brains except to see what's right in front of him.Let's also not forget the American miliary/special forces in the film, who are out of control, and killing everyone (mostly Americans) - best is that they have a ""don't tread on me"" style tattoo on their arm - how amusing. Jefferson would spin in his grave.-- Actually, the only people that come off looking human are the Muslim Terrorists, and leaders of Islamic regimes. They're the main victims here. Victims of evil American business/military conspiracies and at the end of the day, don't really want to hurt anyone. Most give up before the job is even done especially when someone offers to help them fix a flat tire.You would think that perhaps before republicans nuke LA, they would first look for oil in um...Alaska lolAnd the worst, most insane thing about this program - Bauer's daughter who every 5 minutes gets hit with a firestorm of trouble, more than even Bauer himself! Ridiculous.Now understand. I know that there are people who benefit from middle eastern wars. I know that some people in the US might hope for a nuke to go off. But really...this show is so much contrived silliness. I mean, every scene - from Bauer jumping at the chance to kill himself, to the evil female spy who is Bauer's nemesis - and can kill with cardboard like Shibumi, to the President who seems like his acting outclasses everyone around him, like he's on another show...it's just such a silly mess of a plot...you do indeed have to see it to believe it.When I watch a film or tv show, I'm not interested in an argument against a political group in the US. I want to be entertained. And while 24 can be fun and exciting, it has the brainpower of a B Chuck Norris film but with the badguys reversed into being evil capitalists bent on world domination, through using poor middle eastern terrorists as pawns. We have heard this story before. The bottom line is that radical islam is the enemy in the world of cloak and dagger, and these types of shows need to accept that before the thinking public will accept them. Luckily, tv audiences are more into emotion than rationality, and romantic realism is a dead concept in art. So we are left with this as a substitute.If you ever get a chance to see Sandbaggers, or read an old LeCarre novel, you will get what a real spy drama is all about."	1.0	RIDICULOUS x 1000	2011-11-02	10	5	5

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	I received this as a birthday present and have just finished the whole series. What you need to know is that this maintains the high standards set by series one and is superb entertainment.The only downside is the running subplot involving Kim Bauer, which is more than a little far-fetched. However even this is great entertainment, if completely unbelieveable. Virtually all the characters from series one are back in the show, so the President, his wife, Nina, Mason, Tony and Michelle are all involved. Its very cleverly written with multiple over-lapping stories that will keep you guessing all the time. There is political intrigue, family drama, terrorism and enough tension to last you a year let alone 24 hours.Not having seen series 3 yet I have no idea whether the end of series 2 is relevent or not, but it certainly took me by surprise. At times I just wanted to watch episode after episode after episode but unfortunately the neccessity of work prevented me from doing so.This is a magnificent series, and the only problem I have with it is that there aren't enough hours in the day to watch it!	5.0	Top Class Tv	2007-10-03	3	3	0

The show itself is somewhat predictable and not quite as good as all the hype (thus the 4 stars) but it is a good show.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1H97SQ7H34CHH	"Skip Young ""Mr. Choo Choo"""	"It's been rightly said of 24 that it's ""not good, but never boring"".  I think that's true of the first 2 seasons, but by the 4th it had actually become good, and still never boring.  I was surprised that season 2 is as ""not good"" as it is.Could it be any more contrived?  Take for example the way the hero's daughter, Kim, manages to find her way into a different dangerous situation in just about every hour of this long day.  The father of the child she is nannying happens to be a psychotic killer; She's in a city that's about to get nuked; she gets falsely accused of kidnapping and murder and is arrested; she gets in a car wreck; She gets caught in a bear trap; She is threatened by a cougar while alone in the woods; She's taken prisoner by a love struck hermit/survivalist; While hitch-hiking she has to pull a gun to stop an attacker; She's taken hostage in a liquor store; and then just when you think she's finally safe, she has to kill or be killed in the final episode.  And these random threats are mostly unrelated to each other and totally unrelated to the main action of the series.  The only thing that connects her to the story at all is that she just happens to be Jack Bauer's daughter, and all the while he's mostly unaware of any of her crises.  This is all FILLER.  Not just not good, but boring.Most of the suspense this season is caused by the unimaginable incompetence and poor judgment of people in the highest positions of the US government.  Most of the urgency in the second half of the season is due to their ridiculous insistence that the US must retaliate NOW, by the end of the day, because to wait even another few hours would show weakness and lose the element of surprise.  Come on.  How long did it take the US to go to war in Afghanistan after 9/11?  Months.  Did that show weakness?  Did it matter?  Then why are we supposed to believe it would matter so much to so many otherwise intelligent people in this series?Here's the screenwriter's recipe for this series.  Always put prisoners and codefendants in the same cell (a practice that's strictly forbidden in the real world) so they can plot and plan and create drama.  When Jack tortures someone, let him do it in full view or at least in ear shot of someone not accustomed to Jack's ways so they can lose faith in Jack or at least object.  Have CTU employees bring their relatives right into the office to create drama.  Have rational characters become suddenly irrational; once the damage is done, they can become rational again.  Have bickering CTU employees risk world destruction just to spite each other.  This is really not good."	3.0	24's WORST SEASON	2007-06-08	32	30	2

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A16QJ649N8PRV	S. Peek	Season Two of 24 is an exciting DVD collection that is far better than virtually anything one may see on TV.Jack Bauer returns as a counter terrorist agent working to prevent terrorists from detonating a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.  Along with that there is lots of other action going on with Bauer, his daughter, and the other characters.  Some of the events of season two include:  murder, kidnapping, and the president's cabinet considering invoking the 25th Amendment to revmove him from power.Although most of the action was great, I have only given it four stars as the various plots surrounding Bauer's daughter Kim are just too frequent and far fetched.  In the span of 24 hours (the show is in real time), she gets herself involved in countless forms of danger and threats to her life and wellbeing.  Excluding the poor writing involved in her role, this is a superb collection.If you are not a big fan of most of the mediocre TV shows and want to see something different and exciting, I recommend '24'.  You should start with season one though.	4.0	Great Entertainment	2006-06-24	3	3	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A30A5I8FG82M2E	SpookyChick	"Once again, Jack Bauer and the rest of the boys are back to protect U.S. from baddies.  That means if you're a woman, no matter how proud and mentally sound, you better stand back and let the men do their jobs.  As with Season 1, CTU is a boy's club.  The females - whether employed by the U.S. government, or merely related to such employees - are relegated to the proverbial ""damsels in distress"" role that went out with the great feminist uprising of the 1970s.  Kiefer and Co. need to wake up and smell the coffee.  We women may not be as physically strong as our brawnier counterparts, but mentally we are at least as sharp (and often can focus better on difficult work).  I fear the revealing of plot points, so I will not go into great detail.  Suffice it to say that, while I was able to sort of forget the misogynistic undertones of Season 1, Season 2 establishes a pattern that continues unchecked throughout the series.That said, Season 2 is a wilder, less predictable ride than Season 1.  I enjoyed it considerably, and even found myself admiring the chutzpah of the men calling the shots - in spite of my concern about the portrayal of my own kind.It's good, but disturbing."	3.0	More exciting that Season 1 - but troubling for Neo-Femmes	2006-07-08	12	4	8
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A1PPD5TOR6VVYV	S Smyth	Being able to watch this second series over a weekend gave a much tighter perspective on the proceedings. Kim's role seemed very feeble when watching it week by week, but appeared much more satisfactory when watching it like this.To a lesser extent this applied to the other characters and the plot development as a whole, with any plot holes being less obvious, since the viewer is kept in the loop for much longer periods of time, as the hours segue into one another.I was also impressed by how well this series looks, in terms of its lighting and set- design.My only gripe is the short to-black pauses as some scenes cut from one character's section to another. This is one to frequently enjoy, at your convenience.	5.0	This DVD set makes the series even better viewing.	2003-10-18	0	0	0

We couldn't even wait 2 minutes to start the next &quot;hour&quot;!

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3VCFKG8PVV0CO	Stingray Ramone	Personally, amidst the hype 24's sequel season had received, I was somewhat skeptical that Season 2 could outdo the riveting success that was Season 1.  After watching Season 2 in its entirety, it was somewhat of a letdown, but nonetheless, it delivered the same suspense and thrills the first one dished out.The second season takes place 18 months after the events of the first season and it ranges from 8:00pm to 8:00am.  Jack Bauer, played wonderfully by Kiefer Sutherland, returns as a broken man, obviously because of the Season 1 finale.  Kim has disowned Jack and he finds himself lonely and distraught.  Meanwhile, David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), who ran in the presidential primary in Season 1, is the new commander-in-chief of the United States.  President Palmer calls Bauer back on duty, on a dangerous mission to thwart the detonation of a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.  Bauer has the dark mentality of a rogue, feeling as if he has nothing to live for.  In short, Bauer is a good guy, thinking more like a bad guy.  With each hour, Bauer discovers the government conspiracy behind the terrorist threat and it all leads up to the final hour, where Bauer must in essence, save Palmer's presidency and the world, for that matter.The second season of 24 seems to reflect the touchy, changing times and further onward into the waning hours, it reflects the social and political problems of the world today.  Despite the influenced plot and the relatively predictable line of events, 24 carries on the quality of the first season.  The cast, especially Sutherland and Haysbert, is stellar as usual and of course, the nail-biting developments and tone are awesome and cerebral.  For those just new to the phenomenon of 24, I advise that you watch Season 1 first before this second set because your understanding of the story is greatly enhanced.	5.0	Not as Unpredictable as the 1st, but Doesn't Disappoint	2003-06-13	3	1	2

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3OMPSEVL59ZDK	"Sylo ""Sylo"""	One of the most original and novel ideas to come out of television in a very long time. The show has a premise that is not just intriguing but it guarantees that viewers will stick it out for all twenty four episodes. The flaw of course being that anyone who misses the first 5 or 6 episodes will be (for the most part) lost and will be turned off to tuning in so late in the game. The show creates real tension and Jack Bauer is a very good if sometimes over the top character. My only problem is the twists become more and more ridiculous as the season goes on. It seems they throw in everything and anything to keep viewers guessing. The kim sub plots are not only painful to watch but frustratingly stupid. From trying to save a little girl to encountering mountain lions it seems the writers have very little for Kim to do, why not just write her off the show? I hate to think they actually gave her a job in CTU in the next season. I am not looking forward to more of her lame hijinks. I couldn't help but laugh when one character turns out to be a terrorist. COME ONE NOW! That was just dumb. (You know what I'm talking about.)The show is ultimately flawed by its own premise. One story just can't hold for 24 episodes, no matter how hard they try. Its a good show but if they don't quite while they are ahead they may kill the idea completely.	3.0	"Good show despite the""everything but the kitchen sink"" plots"	2004-09-13	16	6	10

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AOKS0M0WS7OF1	"""tech111"""	I'll keep it simple: this is the best TV series, bar none, IMHO.  Since Season One came out on DVD and was such a success, I decided not even to watch the TV broadcasts of the Second Season until the DVD set came out so I could watch it without all the interruptions and waits from week to week.The Second Season delivers just as much suspense as the first.  That is quite a feat for a series of this sort, because I usually tire and begin expecting the unexpected in a series which needs to have some sort of cliffhanger at the end of each episode to keep the audience coming back the next week.  Somehow the writers manage to keep each episode fresh and exciting.  The only thing I found a bit amusing was for the first 12 hours Jack was so careful to avoid telling anyone about the threat of a nuclear blast for fear of panic, and the last 12 hours it seemed like he started telling everyone he met about it.You can't go wrong buying this set if you like thrillers.  Just be sure you make some coffee because you will have a tough time breaking away once you start.I plan to buy Season 3, 4, ....	5.0	Incredible series!!	2003-10-26	3	2	1
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	ANAEFP3DX43WF	teejaym	My wife and I have enjoyed 24 and look forward to each episode.  The four star rating is due to the fact that the sub-sagas leave me weary.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A2JFDCLA9PZGQ0	Teemacs	"The comparisons are striking - the ""a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"" tough guy, the master of all situations, with a profound sense of honour, a determination to do the right thing and not let little pettifogging rules get in the way, and a mawkish sentimentality about his womenfolk. Of course, Wayne was in some ways the personification of a certain image of America, and I wonder if this is part of the appeal of ""24"", the fact that this is how Americans see themselves, as the perennial Good Guy. OK, we may rough up the locals a bit and make them say ""Ouch!"" but it's all in a good cause and completely justified. I'm told it's one of Vice-President Cheney's favourites. I can understand why (where's my waterboard?). Of course, it is made by 20th Century Fox, owners of that other great American fantasy factory, Fox News, so one (this one anyway) wonders whether this is actually White House-approved propaganda, like the ""non-traditional news sources"" referred to by Frank Rich in his wonderful ""The greatest story ever sold"".No matter what it is, it is very tense, exciting television. OK, the storyline involving Kim Bauer is silly, but the main plot is a brilliantly-conceived and -performed bit of television, with a multitude of plot twists and turns, surprises, people turning out to be something other than they first appeared and cliff-hanging endings. Some of it is just a bit too pat and Jack's physical abilities in an exhausted and injured state just too superhuman, but at the end of each episode, you're panting for the next one. Kiefer Sutherland is made for this role and plays it to perfection (one wonders whether, like David Duchovny of ""The X-Files"", he'll ever be able to play anything else). The supporting cast is also generally excellent. How long can they keep up this standard? Hopefully for some time to come."	4.0	Is Jack Bauer the new John Wayne?	2007-04-12	4	3	1

It could not be more fitting.  While somewhat convoluted, the story drags you in and it's HARD to stop letting go.  Kiefer Sutherland is back in the second season here and in his first 5 minutes back at CTU he shocks you.  Kim's back too, though her stories and adventures are shall we say...a lil more convoluted than what is happening with terrorists and nukes...nonetheless, you still can't stop watching.  It's one long roller coaster ride and very worth watching.I think a great drinking game can be made outta this series...whenever Jack tortures someone, shoots someone, or yells, you ought to take a shot...You would prob be drunk by the first episode.  Or everytime Kim gets kidnapped.  All kidding aside, this is a fantastic show...worthy of space on your DVD shelf.	5.0	Jack's Back for another 24 power hours	2006-05-11	3	2	1

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A233QN6P2EEKPS	Tom Collier	Although the above claim might seem a little bold, anyone who has watched the show at length can easily see why. The realtime format of the show adds a unique suspense and urgency not seen in any other TV show. The characters are even stronger, from the vicious but ultimately good-hearted federal agent Jack Bauer(played masterfully by Kiefer Sutherland) to President Palmer, whose nobility hampers as often as it helps, to Jack's pernamently in trouble daughter Kim.Although season 2 doesn't pack the dramatic punch that season 1 did, it's plot moves a lot faster and a lot more tightly. The action is more frequent and more gruesome than the last time around, and the season never hits a semi-slump like the one season 1 hit for a few hours in the middle of the day. Both seasons of 24 should be in any action or drama fan's library, without hesitation.	5.0	The best television show ever	2003-07-09	8	6	2

I don't know how people stood the suspense of waiting for one week or holy moly the time between seasons, to find out what happened to Jack and the crew.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A9C375HSNCY9	Trevor Cotton	I actually saw the majority of the second series of 24 before the first series, therefore i am probably writing the review from a different perspective to most people.  It is in short unmissable television.  Early on you are lead to believe the terrorist threat is from islamic militants and although there is involvement from them the threat is a little more American, and closer to home.  The way the plot turns dramatically at every turning keeps you on the edge of your seat, and though the concept has obviously been used before it does not tire at all.  There are great appearances from Xander Berkeley as the heroic George Mason, now much more involved than in the first series and the devious Sherry Palmer, who figures later in the series.  David Palmer and Jack Bauer are once again played superbly by Dennis Haysbert and Keifer Sutherland.  The only real criticism I have is with the role of Kim Bauer, she was integral to the story in series 1, however in this series her escapades are really irrelavant to the main story.  She was a very popular character so I can see why they were keen to keep her in, but they could have thought about how to use her better.  Overall it doesn't detract much from the quality of the series though, and it is more classic 24.	5.0	More classic drama	2005-11-01	3	3	0

This is not the first time I've received a scratched DVD from Fox. They seem notorious for this. There's no excuse for BRAND NEW DVDs arriving scratched. Unless of course, the case was broken or something. But in this case, they were fine. All discs were perfectly fastened in the case.	3.0	Received scratched DVDs.	2009-05-20	4	0	4

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A108QN0VQPX1W2	Viv	I think the writing and acting is superb, but the constant beating on the viewer with action is unsuitable for young  people, as it incites one to defend onself in similar ways. I was viewing too many per day--wanting to finish the series--and that proved too much activity for me. However, one episode a day is more suitable for older people.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AT8MI5YRGGSB6	Viv Wages	"Let me first of all say that ""24"" has been the greatest show EVER. My whole week revolved around that show. Now that it is gearing up for the next season I am finding out all kinds of things that may happen. One that I hope WILL NOT be is the write up on the so called ""babe"",Jack's daughter Kim. How anyone can say she is an actress must have mud for brains. She has got to be the WORST actess I have seen on TV in a long time. Her situations are unbelievable, her lines are stupid and her expressions are even more stupid. How one teenager can get herself in the situations she has been in comes right out of the ""true romance"" novels. Totally unbelievable. She needs to move to Ohio with her aunt and stay there. Or wherever Jack was sending her before the bomb went off. Please send her away. If the next ""24"" has her as ""coming out of the closet"", I will positively turn my TV off. ... Please don't do it. Let Kim move to Ohio with her aunt and leave Keifer to ""24"". Hopefully there will be enough static on this and the writers for  24 will listen and not let this show become another one to bite the dust.Looking forward to NOT seeing Kim,VivDecatur, Alabama"	5.0	24 and falling	2003-08-21	20	6	14
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3V16YW5UZ00EI	V. John Palicka	I got my freebie intro disc at Best Buy for the first 2 episodes. I did not load them for about 2 months. Big mistake: This second season rocks and hooked me so bad that I had to watch 4 episodes at a time.Naturally, I thought this would be another soapy action series. The writing is so good that lots of fluff is eliminated and you are treated to a cerebral adventure. This show hits the right topic at the right time. Terrorists could place a nuclear device in a major US city.I won't rehash the plots as you can get them off the 24 hour site. But I would say that each turn that you think is leading one way...turns into another unexpected direction.The DVD is superb in sound as bullets on my state of the art 6.1 Dolby seem to be coming fromn the left and from behind me. Great sound! I wonder if I can get the same sound from my TV. If not, another vote for buying the DVD.Also, I work long hours and thus this raises a question: why bother to record or watch each week, when the convenience of the DVD makes viewing more enjoyable and practical.Thus, should I watch the third season or just buy the DVD? I will buy the DVD as I would hate to miss even one episode.There are few time wasters such as stupid car chase scenes, long dying dialogs, or love story complications. Yes, there is some romance, but thank God the writers don't waste time with 'getting to know you&quot;, useless bedroom scenes, shower scenes, crying &quot;I love you scenes&quot;. Yes, this is at a minimal. This is not the show for such stuff, versus cable TV. This is for serious adventure/action enthusiasts.Final comment: the president is so good in this show that one wonders where they found him. Anyway, you won't be dissappointed.My only worry is that if I buy the DVD does that hurt the show versus viewing it on the Nielson ratings. I love you guys, hope you make money off my $50 purchase.	5.0	Wow! Suspense at a good price. Topic  is right on today!	2004-03-23	4	4	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A18IFX0MPR1M37	Wally	Never watched the show while it was in production. Always heard great things about it but never took the time. Then &#34;24: Live Another Day&#34; started airing , so I thought before I watched that I'd better get acquainted with the original episodes. So thankful they're on Amazon Prime. Ten minutes into Season 1 Episode 1, I was hooked. I started watching on my own, but on Episode 4 my wife caught a glimpse and asked me to fill her in on what had happened up to that point. That took about 20 minutes. After that episode finished she was hooked. We are now binge watching, averaging 2-3 episodes a day and have made our way through Season 2.It's really one of the best television productions I've ever seen. TV series, especially of the drama/action variety, normally don't hold my interest for long due to the hokiness factor. 24 busted that paradigm. Awesome series!

Excellent weekly cliff-hangers keep you coming back for more. It's definitely an action-packed, keep you on the edge of your seat show.The interweaving of the various subplots was done very well, but I have to agree with several other people that the ""Kim"" storyline is pretty lame. Her predicaments leave you wondering how anyone could be so dumb... I guess it's good contrast for Sutherland's super-agent character, so it balances out. Considering the entire season is crammed into a single 24 hour period, they've done a fantastic job with developing strong characters very quickly."	5.0	Great show!	2003-08-14	1	1	0
B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3CG1NGATI8WL0	"What the HEY ! ""What the HEY !!"""	I did not watch the '24 Series' when it was running on TV.

Very convenient, HD resolution is 'deliciously clear'.Season 2 is a very interesting, non-stop action-packed Season.  I believe you should be familiar with Season 1 so that you are familiar with the CTU organization and the main characters, although characters to change (die?) from Season to Season.Theme is the CTU (USA counter-intelligence unit) trying to save the USA from realistic every threat imaginable .. :)Most of it is believable ... at least there is no Spider Man or Incredible Hulk.I find this Series much more satisfying than I expected.  Takes some time to watch each Season, but Amazon allows you the opportunity to view at your leisure, your pace.  The Only-Way-to-Go ... !  Enjoy.	5.0	24 Series Review - Season 2	2014-05-23	0	0	0

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	A3HNR9PQC729DL	Woofgang	I watched the two episode promo that came with another DVD and was instantly hooked.  The problem is, the momentum in those first few episodes quickly petered out.Another problem is the story becomes increasingly shoddy and political (evil corporations are the real enemy).  I was waiting for Jack Bauer to squeal &quot;no blood for oil.&quot;  I guess I usually like a rollercoaster ride and lots of twists, but the problem is these twists just don't suprise--all the usual suspects are lined up, leaving one cold, bored, and disappointed. So, while not utterly predictable in the usual sense, the last half of the series just doesn't take us anywhere surprising.The action and acting of the most of the cast sustain this series to its end, however.  The strengths carry a weak story in the last half of the season.  While the story may take a turn for the worse, the series still entertains.  Acting, with the exception of President Palmer, is above average.  Action is very good for a TV drama.Overall Recommendation:  Recommended for fans of action-thriller-spy-adventure TV.  Well done, despite its flaws.	4.0	Stars Great But Loses Momentum	2004-05-08	6	3	3

The primary storyline is convincing.  What made this season just average (or slightly below average) is the fact that the story of Jack's daughter actually detracts from the main story.  While her role was great in season one, her character should have been cut from the series after that.

B00008YGRU	24: Season 2	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Usually, I judge the success of any televised drama by its ability to reinvent itself from season to season.  Too much of the same will lead to stagnation, while too much change will actually alienate loyal viewers.  24, however, is a completely new breed of show and thus does not adhere to the typical critiques of TV drama.Essentially, the second season of 24 follows the same parameters as the first.  Over the course of a single day, CTU (Counter-Terrorism Unit) agent Jack Bauer must get himself (and the nation) out of a crisis...this time when a nuclear bomb is set to detonate in Los Angeles and could prompt World War 3 if the plot succeeds.  Of course, besides Bauer, a host of other characters (Kim Bauer, Tony Almeida, George Mason, etc.) round out the cast.  The twists and turns are just as mind-blowing as the first go-round, yet it never seems to get old due to the great acting and straight-forward plot devices (every episode ends with a new huge twist).The biggest reason the Season Two succeeds, though, is that much more time is devoted to the character of Jack Bauer, who really is the fulcrum of the show.  The episodes in which the raging, frenetic Jack takes center stage will have you on the edge of your seat and literally cheering out loud!  Whereas in the first half of the first season Bauer was little more than a concerned parent, this entire season sees him wriggling his way out of tight spot after tight spot...MacGyver has nothing on Jack Bauer.  I never thought I would find an actor who brings more intensity to his role than Matthew Fox gives to Jack Shepard on LOST, but Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer eclipses him.So, if you were intrigued (or completely thrilled!) by the first season of 24, this second season will not let you down.  Between the plot twists, the intensity of Bauer, and the surprising return or demise of a few old ""friends"", this season again will have you watching episode after episode deep into the night."	5.0	Thrives On The Intensity Of Jack Bauer	2009-01-27	0	0	0

When I finally did, I enjoyed it, but it rang a bit hollow to me.  This second season is much better, especially Keifer Sutherland.  The dark and disturbed edge of Jack Bauer this season brings much more depth to his character and is never overblown.  While I originally thought offing his wife in the first season was a mistake, it led to a great change in his character.  Xander Berkley as George Mason is also a very well done tragic character.My main complaint is Kim.  My friend called her ""a walking Darwin award"" and I couldn't agree more.  There seems to be a problem in 24 with most of the women being either stupid or manipulative (which is another reason not to give this 5 stars), but she's by far the dumbest.  Whenever they go to her subplot I cringe, and then laugh while they're playing out.  I see the need for a tie to Jack's family, but the writers either need to get her better integrated into the story, stop her from running into every sleazy guy stereotype (the loner militia guy, the cartoonish wife beater), or just get rid of her altogether.Otherwise, I really enjoy this show.  I still can't bring myself to be tied to my TV every week, but as long as they bring out the seasons on DVD, I look forward to more Jack Bauer goodness."	4.0	A rare TV show I enjoy	2003-10-13	0	0	0
