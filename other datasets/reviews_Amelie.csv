Also, the starring actress if pretty easy on the eyes.The DP on this film has an encredible eye for composition, balance, and color. It's obvious they did tons of color correction and filtering, but it augments the movie rather than detracting from it or distracting the viewer.The soundtrack is incredible and it sits in my CD-magazine in my car.	5.0	The Best	2004-02-16	5	1	4

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3FV933KPQHTZV	555	I must say, that after seeing this movie, I have never felt so good in my whole life!!! This is an excellent comedy story as well as a sweet and poingant romance! I live for subtitles, so this didnt bother me the least bit, for after a few minutes, you are so into the story that you forget about them until the very end. Audrey Taotou and Mathieu Kassovitz both gave EXCELLENT performances, and are totally believable as their characters of Amelie and Nino. The cinematography and use of color is AMAZING, and the film is worth watching for that alone, but besides that, its such a sweet story about a very shy waitress in Paris (shot on location)who discovers a little secret behind a bathroom tile in her house. And from then on, she devotes herself to doing good to others... but will Amelie ever do to herself what she has done so graciously for others, by seizing the man she loves? Or will she be too shy and let the oppurtunity of a lifetime pass right by her? Well, I guess you'll have to watch this WONDERFUL movie and find out!!!	5.0	OH MY GOODNESS!!!!	2005-07-13	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	ADQR1YOVVHSCL	"""aainaalyaanet"""	Being away in Asia, and far from European civilisation, I had a chance to grab this wonderful memoire of Paris, and found it to be fresh and petillant.Unlike most non-European films that I've been exposed to in Malaysia, Amelie Poussaint, reflects a typical parisian outlook on life with all its bleakness, innocence of human living that can only happen in Paris. Audrey Tatou the petite surbarbian carries the character well, and in not so many words, brought out one of the best movies I've watched over the past year.I would recommend this movie to those who have not been to Paris, and those who would like to refresh memories of Paris again in their hearts. This film was made for you. And only you can know and experience the same flesh tingling effect of the movie, when you've lived in Paris. The air, the scent, the cafe, all these are not found elsewhere even in franchise cafes and makeover bistrots in Asia, or the US.	5.0	Amelie et Moi	2002-12-27	5	5	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1SJ4I15UI1CPZ	A. Anderson	Amelie is a quirky, fun film that is charming from beginning to end.  Amelie is an introverted young French girl that feels for the down-trodden and sad of her world and sets out (by way of experiment) to do something about it.  The narration keeps the action moving and the quirky characters are a delight.  Even when Tautou looks straight into the camera and makes a statement to the audience, you are not jarred, but it's more as if you have become a conspirator to the action.  As a parting gift the film leaves with you, for a short time, the memory of its gracious and biting charm.	4.0	Quirky and Unusual	2013-07-29	0	0	0

Unique color scheme, a wry dry narrative wit that I love, and an allegorical tale that doesn't forget the importance of character development or plot the way that most allegories do.  It moves at a nice fast pace, and both narrative and dialogue were written by someone who cares about the words.  Maybe it's a little twee, but so what?  I recommend it.  It's miscast as a comedy, but it is funny, and it doesn't really fit comfortably into any genre, so what the heck, call it a comedy and enjoy it."	3.0	Very watchable	2008-06-01	6	1	5
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1TU1Z9N9LTWDQ	A Customer	This film merits five stars. Altruism is the vacuum which nature abhors in human relationships; the title character confronts this dilemma with imagination and great sense of humor. At first glance, it may appear that the director has approached the interior struggles of Amelie with very broad strokes, based upon the title character's overt actions. However, the director is working on many levels and with exquisite subtlty. This gem of a movie slips messages to the viewer on many levels via the vehicle of the title character's apparently outrageous reactions to her emotional environment.Imagination is the ever-present unseen character of the piece. Unlike David Lynch, who tends to overwork some metaphors, this director's approach, while nonlinear, is nevertheless sublimely coherent in its depth of layers. The character of Amelie is engaged in a struggle to nourish her soul, while at the same time acknowledging the reality that altruism is the vacuum nature abhors in human interactions. This awareness presents challenges to Amelie in her dealings with others and also with herself.Like the title character, the director manages this internal conflict with superb imagination and a great sense of humor. This is the story of a series of small truimphs and setbacks building to the resolution of Amelie's inerior struggle. While the journey is a wild ride that does not appeal to all tastes, the resolution is a powerful argument for life, individuality and resistance to templates imposed by society.Amelie is a deeply meaningful, humorous, feel-good movie. The outlandish elements employed are artfully used to provide the resolution of Amelie's emotional pain resulting from the clash of her altruistic nature with the realities of the world crashing down around her. Any attempt to &quot;tone down&quot; these outlandish elements would have resulted in not giving Amelie's great heart and imagination the voice they deserve in proportion to the voice of the unrelenting realities of the outside world.Amelie is the purr of the Cheshire Cat. See Amelie to reconnect with that &quot;inner child&quot; we hear so much about. See Amelie to give your imagination muscle a workout. Amelie is a stunning affirmation of the proactive approach in embracing life!	5.0	Altruism and Amelie	2002-09-15	3	3	0

This charming tale of a Parisian girl named Amelie is the first foriegn movie that showed me another side to movie making. The style and theme of this movie changed some of my perspectives on life.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3QD2Z6V8IXDS3	Adam Snyder	Movie: This movie is in my Top 5. It's just so whimsical, imaginative and fun. It makes you cry from happiness and you smile almost the entire film. Am&eacute;lie plays a matchmaker to random Parisians and goes on a journey or self-discovery that she can't stay introverted and alone. You must watch it. I mainly made this review to state some issues on the Blu-ray...Blu-ray quirks: This Blu-ray does not allow you to press Top Menu or Pop-Up Menu (or anything) during any of the trailers, company promos, etc. The only button that you can press is the Skip forward button, which takes quite a while if you Blu-ray player is older like mine. The blu-ray that I purchased from Amazon does have a menu when you finally get to it that does have a Setup menu, unlike another reviewer mentioned... It has the standard Play, Setup, Scenes, and Special Features, but is not intuitive. It makes you press the left arrow to escape out of menus and doesn't have any explanation onscreen. All of the menus move when you move your cursor and it's just hard to use.Blu-ray: The movie is beautiful in HD, sounds great with the dts-ma hd 5.1 French audio. It even has a dts calibration tool and dts-hd trailer that I have not seen on any other Blu-ray. I have owned this on DVD from long ago and now finally Blu-ray.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AA8EXPATBYNG3	"Alexander Daul ""vesuv"""	It's lovely to notice that there is still a director who tells a lovestory in a differnt way as usual and chooses a figure who is different too.Dreaming while living in her own world and always helpful towards other people Amelie falls in love. What follows is a &quot;game of love&quot; which is stamped by humour and fun dependent on situation. Amelie tries to support other people (without noticing it) to realize their dreams and to solve their problems. She also includes her own &quot;craze&quot; in a game of confusion  which shows the fear and the contemporary wish of a relationship with this person clearly.It's a magical movie which Jean-Pierre Jeunet brought onto the screen of our cinemas and now our TVs. He succeeded in shooting an unusual movie which is told with nice rides and adjustments of the camera, with much irony and joke, with much love and romantic, with a nicely told story and with beautiful ideas. The movie bewitches me every time I see it again! You must watch this!	5.0	Fabulous	2002-08-13	2	2	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A23L2BR07AOBG1	alex bushman	It's surprising that a film like this could fool a large number of people into thinking it adds up to a charming love story.  I hate to say it, but this is not a love story at all.  Amelie isn't even a story, it's an exercise.  The main difference between the two comes with flow and the editing doesn't allow that to foster a good story.  The closest the director gets to telling a story in this movie is in the very beginning where Amelie is introduced and her dilemma is presented.  The rest of the movie is about her solving this dilemma, but here is where the problem with the movie lies.  The rest of the movie feels too processed and disconnected from the true moment of feeling that the characters are going through.  Many times it feels as if the last 3/4 of the movie is simply filled with tiny bits and pieces of ideas that the director thought would be interesting enough.  I don't believe that they are because the beginning prepared me for an odd love story although, I should've known that the plot would be constantly detoured in the beginning when the narrator reveals the ponderous questions that Amelie was wondering while on top of the building. Nonetheless, my lack of foresight doesn't make this film's  lack of cohesion go away.  Add to that the fact that the movie has a constantly strange production quality that permeates the film and allows us to know that strange things will happen instead of just letting the story be strange and surprising us with an interesting moment. The knocks I have about the production don't just affect the story, they sideline it by making it seem like the movie is simply about daft craftmanship rather than the tale at hand.  I don't mind high style  cinematography, especially by this director because I love his previous film &quot;The City of Lost Children.&quot; That film had a strong story driving it's craftiness, this one doesn't. I only give it two stars because I recognize hard work on the visuals and I found some of the material humorous and/or dramatically effective, but this is an inferior film, story-wise to the aforementioned film and isn't really a romantic comedy because it's really hard to get past the directors reliance on technical proficiency over plot. It struck me that the film had a good story idea and not enough development to get through.	2.0	scattershot stylistic exercise	2003-08-06	29	17	12

B0000640VO	Amelie	A32GCOTGFJ9XC3	"Alex Honda ""onyx575"""	"I love Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film, AM&Eacute;LIE. I already owned theAm&eacute;lie2-DVD set and have been in love with the movie since my friends took me to see it at a French movie theater back in the early part of 2002 (BTW it is in French with English or Spanish subtitles).If you haven't seen it, AM&Eacute;LIE is a wonderful story about two lonely people who've been dreaming about one another since they were children. Both Am&eacute;lie (Audrey Tautou) and Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) wished they had another person in their life, being such lonely children, and one day as adults, their paths cross. In the meantime, both acquire quirks and Am&eacute;lie, after finding a tin box filled with a boy's childhood treasures, decides that she's going to reunite the owner (now a 40+ man) with the lost keepsake. After proving a successful and joyous reunion, she vows to become a crusader for good helping all the other lonely people around her.However, no matter how many good deeds she accomplishes, Am&eacute;lie cannot escape the cold loneliness that she feels inside and around her, until she's finally forced to help herself and take that flying leap of faith and letting someone else in.Perhaps that's why I enjoy this movie so much. It isn't just a boy-meets-girl type of film; it explores the angst that comes along with meeting someone that you feel a connection with and that period in-between, especially if you've been alone for a long time, and you just don't know how to take the next step.Another great thing about this film is the use of special effects. This has to be the first movie that I've seen that uses special effects and it isn't in the science fiction/fantasy genre. The use of the effects really punctuate the story and gives it a whimsical feel. Although it does paint a romanticized view of life and of Paris, it's used to great effect throughout and I love the visual style of it.The BLU-RAY edition of AM&Eacute;LIE is gorgeous! The saturated colors really pop and the clarity makes the movie a feast for the eyes.I am however a little disappointed that there wasn't any new special features added to this BLU-RAY edition.In fact, several extras on the DVD are gone from here: the TV Spots, the French language trailer, and the cast and crew filmography. Not a big deal though since all the important specials were ported over and everything is on one disc.******  SPECIAL FEATURES  ******""Audio Commentary By Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet"" - in English""Look Of Am&eacute;lie"" - 12:48-minutes EnglishDirector Jeunet and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel discuss the use of special effects and visual style used in the movie.""Fantasies Of Audrey Tautou"" - 2:07-minutesBloopers.""Screen Tests"" - Play All or One At A Time - French w/English subtitlesAudrey Tautou - 01:58 - interesting to note that Tautou was not Jeunet's first choice for Am&eacute;lieUrbain Cancelier - :38 - the grocer, ""Monsieur Colignon""Yolande Moreau - 03:52 - Am&eacute;lie's downstairs neighbor, ""Madeleine""""Q & A With Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet"" (English) - 24:37-minutesFilmed at a screening at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, CA, and audience get to ask questions at the end.""Q & A With Director And Cast"" (French W/English subs) - 05:55Another screening Q & A with the director, Tautou, Kassovitz, and Jamel Debbouze (Lucien).""Storyboard Comparison"" - :58short clip of the fun house scene with the storyboards.""An Intimate Chat With Jean-Pierre Jeunet"" - (French W/English subs) - 20:48-minutesCharming and funny, Jeunet talks about the film, the idea etc. and how it came to be, and the controversy surrounding the Cannes Film Festival.""Home Movies: Inside The Making Of Am&eacute;lie"" - 12:46Interesting behind-the-scenes footage of Tautou getting her hair cut and styled into the famous bob; showing the extras that took the pictures in the photo-booth for Nino's photo book; test shots for camera angles; Serge Merlin ""Dufayel aka the Glass Man"" rehearsing lines; Debbouze (Lucien) preparing to shoot his scene etc.Trailers - EnglishScrapbook - includes behind-the-scenes, French Poster concepts, Storyboards, and the Garden Gnome's Travels (which I swear Travelocity stole the idea for their roaming Gnome ads).Anyway, if you already own the 2-DVD set of AM&Eacute;LIE and don't really need the 1080p high definition makeover, you could probably skip this Blu-Ray edition. But if you'd like to see it in hi-def and own a high definition TV, plus you love the movie, I highly recommend AM&Eacute;LIE on BR."	5.0	*Same Specials* As 2-DVD Set, Minus 3. *Blu-Ray* Looks Stunningly *Beautiful*!	2011-09-07	8	8	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1KFX4ONH83LIT	Alice	First of all, I watched the movie before reading any reviews and expected to turn it off before a few minutes as I do with some other films (as many have violence and nudity throughout which I personally feel is unnecessary--and the movie will go off followed by my sad review).  This movie however,  with  humor and depth,  had me watching it several times to attempt to figure it out.  Until I just read Bernard's review,  I had no idea what lied behind the translation.  It's time I took up the French language.  Knowing a list of vocabulary words is not enough for me anymore.  I can almost relate to the protagonist--being an only daughter of elderly parents--and figuring life out in my own 'creative' ways.  I would highly recommend this amusing comedy.  Just to clarify, this is not a 'nudity free' production; however, the flashes of such scenes that she has in her mind are fleeting thoughts and created 'humorously' which add to the movie's humor, yet I definitely could live without and still see this as an awesome production.	5.0	A  Pleasant French Surprise!	2013-07-28	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3QF5HLZS4B7L3	Allen P. Frederick	"I saw this recently in a hotel room while on a business trip.  I began watching casually, but became drawn in the longer I watched.  (I think that's what good art is supposed to do...)  I won't go into the story -- that's been done enough here.  I just want to tell what I found to be the most memorable scenes:1) The scene where Amelie is cutting up the copied letters in order to create a new letter purportedly from her older friend's fallen loved one.  THe scene begins with her holding up a letter and a scissors, then zoom!, fast-forwards through all the cut and paste to then show her soaking the newly created letter in wine to ""age"" it.  That was just cool.2) The scene where Amelie is standing near the photo booth and sees the bald man emerge with the toolbox.  ""Of course!"" some of us say, while the camera focuses on Amelie smiling, and the scene goes entirely white.  It's the ultimate expression of:  ""Then it dawned on me!""3) The scene where Amelie finally opens the door and finds Nino standing there.  Nothing is said.  She kisses him in three different places on his face and neck.  He looks at her and then does the same in return.  I don't react kindly to ""sappy"" scenes, but this was done so well, expressing amazement, recognition, kindness, respect, and happiness, AND yes, love.This film is wonderful and artistic.  If I were to suggest an improvement, I would want to add a component of faith, just because that, like love, romance, joie de vivre, etc. is so important to so many people, regardless of what so many others tell them they must or must not believe.  If I were to cast any criticism, the restroom romp scene was a bit overdone, but yes it was amusing...Great fun to watch, and I'd recommend it as one of the best foreign films I've seen.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2PUYMR4W89GUY	Amanda	The title character of Amelie is so adorable, you can't help but love her. She is a young woman who takes so much pleasure in helping other people find happiness, she forgets to find a little for herself. Whether she's trying to fix up a co-worker with a regular customer, or defending a shy young man at the grocery store who is picked on by his boss, Amelie is the ultimate do-gooder. She is so cute and sweet, you kind of wish she was YOUR friend. This is a wonderful French film (by far, the best I have ever seen) that will charm the heck out of you. This film had me from the very beginning, when it was showing Amelie as a little girl (wreaking havoc with the neighbor's television reception), right up until the very end where she lived happily ever after. And yes, it is quirky - but not bad quirky. For instance, the scenes where Amelie's father keeps receiving pictures in the mail of his missing garden gnome in various countries, yes it's a little odd - but hilarious. If you're looking for a light, fun film, this is it. Nevermind the subtitles, you may not even need them - you'll be so fixed on the beautiful scenery, and on Audrey Tautou that you may even forget to pay attention to the dialogue. That is the power of this film. Just sit back, relax, and spend some quality time in Amelie's world. It's a great place.	5.0	A Fine French Film	2002-12-16	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	AUKRQ2JNMDJSN	Amazon Customer	This movie is extremely funny. At times whimsical, and at other times quite insightful. It manages to capture the pace and energy of living in Paris, but the entire film revolves around Am&eacute;lie's efforts to maintain a level of warmth and human interaction that are missing from her life. The movie presents Paris from Am&eacute;lie's singularly unique point of view, and it's impossible not to love.The story starts with a number of vignettes as we see young Am&eacute;lie growing into adulthood, while the remainder of the story centers around a set of coincidences that convinces her to try and change the lives of those around her for the better. The pacing with which this movie jumps from scene to scene is often quite energetic (and in some ways similar to the films of Baz Luhrmann).Yann Tiersen's soundtrack is in my top 5 of the best ever composed, and probably #1 for how well that score fits the film. Its unique combination of accordion and piano is so good that it kicked off more than a decade of very bad imitators any time a movie or tv show was set in Paris (the most amusing rip-off of which I heard was in season 3 of Project Runway).Parents be warned: Quick but slightly graphic depiction of birth at the beginning, a few scenes depicting sex (mostly comical with mild female nudity), and one of the characters works in a Sex shop. The sex shop is more of an issue on High Def screens, since when I first watched this 10+ years ago I hadn't even realized that character was putting price tags on (boxed) sex toys.The subtitles, while adequate, do fail to capture some of what's being said, particularly by the narrator. Though this doesn't prevent you from following the movie, some of the poignancy and detail of the narrator's comments are lost.	5.0	Astounding film	2013-09-22	0	0	0

Later, when I spoke to her about it, she admitted that recently watched the movie after many, many years since she last watched it. She was surprised that she had loved it so much, because this time, she thought it was just &#34;okay&#34;. For my daughter, though, it had more to do with her own personal, emotional, spiritual growth over the years. When she first saw it many, many years ago she LOVED it because of where her life was at the time.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A12S2DN4QA8URE	Amazon Customer	My own personal judge of how much I enjoy a foreign film is whether or not I become so involved in the story that I forget I'm reading the subtitles.  The movies that have done that for me are Life is Beautiful, Il Postino, and now Amelie.This is an enchanting story of a young woman growing up in France and of her adult life in Paris.  Her childhood is neatly explained, but the bulk of the movie concerns her life in Paris.  The movie follows her and the cast of characters surrounding her as she subtly manipulates their lives: bringing together two of the regulars in the cafe where she works, sending her father's garden gnome around the world in hopes of inspiring her father to do the same, etc.  She is sweet and a little bit devilish at the same time.If you are looking for a heartwarming movie - this is it!  The story is involving, the Paris shown in the movie is a place of magic, exactly what I imagined Paris to be before I visited the city.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A33KXAI8L7BUS3	Amazon Customer	Why I loved this movie:  First off, it's in french, subtitled.  Which I love, because I adore the sound.  Secondly, it's surreal.  Beautifully weird.  Thirdly, I totally identify with Amelie, which is probably going to sound really bad once I start talking about the movie.Basically, it's a fairytale.  This girl grows up in a very cold family, so she developed a very active fantasy life (which thankfully didn't involve dancing mice), but no social skills.  So when the movie really starts, she's 23, but already has a number of eccentric habits, and she's basically started down that path that ends with 45 cats in a studio apartment.  She has an eclectic, but very nice apartment, she still visits her father every week, even though he doesn't seem to care, she has a job as a waitress in a cafe near Montmartre.  She goes through life as an observer, not a participant, and there's nothing to make her get more involved.  So then one day--the day Lady Di died--she finds a box in her apartment that belonged to a little boy 40 years before.  And she decides to find him.  She decides that if he is pleased to get the box back, she'll continue doing good things like that.  And if he isn't, well, so what. You don't need to know more than this.All that you really need to know is that it's wonderful.  It's like watching a deLint story, almost.  It's fabulously surreal, it's gorgeous, it has little bits of magic in an ordinary life.  Amelie is a French Jilly, but not so chipper.  She's gloriously fey--the poster makes her look almost scary--and so nice.  She still at 23 has a very active imagination, and she manages to be pure evil (in an okay manner) once in the movie.  I want this movie.  It was a little sad, very sweet, hysterically funny, and utterly charming all in one. It goes on my list to buy, as if I'll ever find it in the states.  As it is, I'm probably going to go see it sometime this week.	5.0	Pure Magic	2001-11-26	36	31	5
B0000640VO	Amelie	A14B73GG8OFXKH	Amazon Customer	Jeunet has done it again, this time apparently without the help of his usual partner, Marc Caro.Amelie is a perfectly French film, demonstrating the French knack for finding beauty in the mundane and accepting human frailty.  Poor little Amelie grew up with somewhat loving but eccentric and unapproachable parents.. Her childhood social life and family situation has made her into a painfully shy but compassionate young woman.  She has retained her childish way of finding likes and dislikes -- another French specialty? -- and instead of making judgments on practical bases, she makes decisions with her intuition.  She intuits her role in life, her lovelife -- you'd guess she probably picked her place of residence based on the grain of wood on the balustrade.This is a character you will root for; you will talk to her as she struggles with her bizarre insecurities; you will applaud her clever mischief; your heart will ache joyfully when she succeeds in her first mission of giving meaning to another person.. (you'll know what I mean when you see it) I have to say, if you don't care about this beautiful creature, your heart is defective.All that aside, Jeunet works his usual magic with stop-motion, animation, slow-mo, various effects, highly stylized dream sequences put into documentary format.  Of course the performances are all perfect as usual, and there is at least one &quot;usual suspect&quot; on the credits.I was foolish enough to miss this one in the theatre, but luckily decided to take the time to see it on DVD..

B0000640VO	Amelie	AP9UOXX9272YO	"Amazon Customer ""Noble Poet"""	"The French movie starts off with a butterfly landing in the street, then getting run over. That same day, Amelie is born into this world. Beauty reformed--ironically, another word for ameliorate (Amelie--ameliorate?).In this charming piece of award winning cinematography, Amelie is raised in a rather dysfunctional family by her parents. Her father, who likes to invest time in his miniature shrine, mourns over the loss of his wife, who was killed by a suicidal body from the sky near the doors of Notre Dame. During Amelie's skewed youth, she turns much to her imagination.Life's simple pleasures come easy to Amelie--at least in her mind. Her newfound passion for helping others serves gratifying, yet her preference for publicity was unwanted. She plays the role of a female Zorro, helping strangers without adopting credit. She lashes her sword against an evil force whom maltreats a man's love for quality produce. Intrigued by what I mean? Watch the movie.In time, her heart of gold crosses paths with another man, one whom seeks a mystery of his own. Amelie becomes a second mystery in the man's life by marking clues of her existence after retaining his research he had dropped while chasing his mystery entity in a certain scene. After returning his odd memoir, she leads him through her fantasy and falls in love. Both were dreamers. Both were seeking love. Both lived shadows in a seemingly different world. Still intrigued? Watch the movie.If you are also a person who looks for the ""art"" in a movie, one can not help but notice the complexity of the cinematography to which it's most defined for amongst film critics and analysts. The use of 3 basic colors in the movie was a challenge which proved to be worth taking. Green, red, and a speck of blue was used in nearly every shot. As you will notice after watching the film, its colors and montage are bold. The use of the limited colors helped create a mystical, mesmerizing gold color in which was used in a few scenes to accentuate significant signs or emotions. The camera shots used were just as well creative and challenging, which deserves recognition as well.This movie is not for those who are seeking action-packed drama with the high level of thrill and suspense one might expect from a highly acclaimed film. This film can be appreciated by those who enjoy the simple pleasures life has to offer. It can be appreciated by those with colorful imaginations and avid art-lovers.Intriguing?

B0000640VO	Amelie	ABRKIJ6D4V42O	"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster"""	I was vaguely interested in viewing Amelie mostly due to the picture of the charming Audrey Tautou on the film poster. I had viewed two of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films before - 'City of Lost Children' and 'Alien: Resurrection', the former being a dark and cynical fairy tale and the latter being the most forgettable of the Alien films. So the bright, cheerful and optimistic feel of the film came as a complete and total surprise - and the storyline hit a little bit too close to home.Ever remember what it was like being a teenager? If you're good looking, you've got nothing to worry about, but if you're slightly overweight and have an acne problem, then you can pretty much forget hanging out with the in-crowd. I spent most of my teenage years alone, with no friends to spend time with. Fortunately, my adult life has been a lot more fun. So I could very easily empathise with what Amelie was going through - she uses her good deeds as a way of connecting with the rest of humanity - a way of not feeling alone. So for me, the ending of the film has a huge resonance, and that final romantic image will stay with me for a very long time.I'm glad that I didn't see this film in the theatre with an audience. The themes in this film are way too personal - the concept of being lonely, separated from the rest of society and trying (and succeeding) in forming a connection with the people around you. I'm glad that I could watch this film on DVD, in the privacy of my own home. That way, no one can see the tears streaming down my cheeks every single time I watch this film.	5.0	A wonderful film with themes that struck a bit too close to	2002-07-27	2	2	0

Audrey Tautou is the most ideal actress for this film.  She brings the character of Amelie to life and makes the audience fall in love with her.  She is one of the most adorable actresses out there and she gives Amelie personality.  This movie is extremely comical and at the same time a great romantic story.  Even though the man she is in love with works at a porn shop.  It is a great French film and hopefully it will receive all the recognition it deserves.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3R3JBS60FNFU0	"A. M. Plowright ""Andy Plowright"""	It seems somehow fitting that I've finally watched Amelie this day in November 2004 as Christmas approaches. The sheen and gloss of lights and decorations, the smell of rank consumerism spread thickly, the glow of decorative lights over one of Toronto's many panhandlers as they ask for change... ahhhh, it's good to be alive when we have films such as this to keep us cheerful as half the world battles in conflict, battles itself or battles poverty and starvation. Visually it is glorious, imaginative camera shots, excellent direction and some beautiful locations used with the colours tearing out from the screen. Like a cr&egrave;me brulee however, the shell is easily cracked and the actual core lacks substance. The central character is retchingly cute, from the immovable hairstyle to her facial mannerisms. She makes Judy Garland in the Wizard of Oz look like Courtney Love and probably excretes lavender lavender. The scenes explaining her messed-up childhood are generally played for laughs, depriving the character of any sort of audience sympathy by the time she reaches young adulthood and a life of being a loner with an odd imagination. Kooky, strange, weird, she's all of that and more. Quite how she ended up with previous boyfriends is beyond me, perhaps there's a curious brand of Frenchman who enjoys penetrating innocent unmoving rather asexual females who haven't adjusted to the realities of life. The post-coital cigarette probably gets replaced by a Chupa Chup: dirty talk goes no further than `pee pee' (and we're not talking watersports here).The film really nosedives when she starts to fall for Nino, played by Mathieu Kassovitz. In short she becomes the odd girl at school whom you had a major crush on, kept asking out and then realized once you were going out with her that she spent much of her time talking to her dog as she believed he could understand her better than most people. The notes Amelie leaves, the excruciating caf&eacute; scene where he can't immediately recognize her due to the disguise she wears on the photos she left... as the disguise consists of a Zorro hat and eye mask, one can only surmise that Nino is brutally myopic. She makes him wander halfway around Paris pursuing photos and pieces of paper, messes him around without a thought, he falls for him despite all of this and yet can't recognize her close up, unadorned with aforementioned Zorro semi-outfit? By the end of it you'll be screaming at her to actually talk to the damn guy because you know the film won't finish until she ends up with him and you want to go to bed/go out/do anything other than watch this girl prolong the tedium any further. Eventually she does snag the chap, they embrace, kiss cheeks and then dispatch themselves to bed. Perhaps there is symbolism there in that she previously found sex to be an unemotional detached experience and, now that she is with the man of her dreams, it becomes something more fulfilling. It doesn't come over as a grand statement about romance and true love though, more a sugary-sweet daydreamer's idea of what true love is like and how to snare a partner.The story is very simple, the plot hardly that imaginative yet there are masses of people out there who praise this film to the heavens. In terms of romantic fantasy, it can be compared to something like Tim Burton's Big Fish and loses out to this film in every way, from characterization to plot to the depth of imagination used. It's a feel-good fairy story with none of the magic that makes Hans Christian Anderson or Brothers Grimm tales special. If you find Friends to be an example of fantastic inter-relationship screenwriting and Ally McBeal to be wonderfully quirky and imaginative then you'll suck up this film like a dehydrated sponge. The whole film is forced whimsy and, if you are of sane mind and body, the only forcing that should be undertaken is to force it out of your DVD player as quickly as possible and curse it for wasting two precious hours of your life.	1.0	Stylish?

I instantly fell in love with this amazing little gem of a film.Amelie is an introspective, thoughtful young woman who is inspired one day to help improve the lives of those around her. Before you start to think this is some schlocky, maudlin film about doing good deeds let me set the record straight. The things that Amelie does to improve her friends' lives are far from normal. Whether she's sending her father's garden gnome on a trip across the world or hypothesizing about a man in a strange set of photographs Amelie's mind is always delightfully at work. She lives in a dream world and an enchanting world it is.In addition to the vivid and original storyline the film also has a signature visual style. This was my first time viewing a film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but it will certainly not be my last. The colors jump wildly off the screen and the cinematography is breathtaking. I can't wait to watch the film without the subtitles and simply take in the visual artistry of it.""Amelie"" is such an inspiring film and one that will stick with you for a long time.

B0000640VO	Amelie	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I watched `Amelie' solely because some friends went on a ten minute rant on just how wonderfully splendid a movie it is.  I have to say that after watching it through it truly is splendid.  This is due in large part to Audrey Tautou's delightful performance as Amelie.  She's so infectiously sweet and charming it's a shame she never got the coveted Oscar nomination that said year, but in the Academies defense it was a very tough year.  Truly though, the film as a whole soaks up her sweet disposition and delivers a wholesomely delicious cinematic experience that is hard to find amidst modern cinema.  `Amelie' proves to be one of the more well-rounded delightful films I've seen in a long time, one of those very rare films that puts a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your stomach.The film, coupled with a tremendous script, follows young Amelie as she endeavors to make right the lives of everyone around her.  Amelie grew up in a not so happy home with a not so happy father and mother and thus in her adulthood she distances herself from reality and instead of making friends and companions she busies herself with making everyone she knows and or comes encounter with happy, trying in a very humble and secretive way to make their dreams come true, whether it be setting them up with the man (or woman) of their dreams or helping them get back at the person who makes their life a living Hades.  Her biggest accomplishment though comes in the form of herself, for in helping a certain someone reunite with a memory of times past she realizes that she herself needs some helping out and thus makes her own life better for it.  I'm being completely and utterly honest when I say that no movie I've seen in recent years is as sweet and charming as `Amelie'.My favorite part of this film would have to be Amelie's decision to send her father's favorite garden-gnome on a trip around the world.  This is of course in an attempt to persuade her father to travel before he dies, but it's this simple gesture to me that somewhat sums up the whole feel of this film.  It's so light and sweet and now every time I see the `Travelocity' commercials I'm reminded of this uplifting film.Everything about `Amelie' works to its advantage and this in effect works very well for the audience.  Amelie moves through her life in a fairytale way, meeting new people and diverging on new quests on a whim and this adds so much to the saccharine feel of the film, giving the audience that fuzzy feeling of joy wrapped in blissful happiness.  The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, does a wonderful job in creating the perfect atmosphere for his dreamlike tale.  As `Amelie' rolls on the audience is connected with Tautou's character in such a strong way because we begin to understand what has formed the angelic creature before us.  She's sheltered and shy yet overtly charming and endearing.  The ending may be predictable but it's the type of predictable that makes us glad we came to the movies.  Who wouldn't want everything to turn out wonderful for this selfless human being?So, the verdict from me at least is watch this film and enjoy from start to finish what may very well be the most upbeat and uplifting charm of a film ever made.  I know that may seem like a lot of undue praise, but is it really undue?  If you watch `Amelie' expecting the good time you deserve you'll be richly rewarded with feelings that modern cinema all too often forgets to award us.  Watching the beautifully captivating Tautou prance from scene to scene in all her impishly angelic glory is enough to melt to hard of even the iciest of people.	5.0	Infectiously sweet and charming, a complete winner from every angle...	2007-08-01	4	3	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1FBZRYTAA6O1Z	"Andrew Urquhart ""Metal Guru"""	Given that 'Delicatessen' is one of the best films ever made on any planet, 'Amelie' is a little bit of a disappointment, to understate the case somewhat.Watching it is like comparing Spielberg's 'Hook', with 'Duel', Scorsese's 'Casino' with 'Taxi Driver', or Coppola's 'Godfather 3' with, er . . . 'Godfather'. Yet another director who has flattered with their cinematic talents only to deceive us with sub-standard pap, once they have made a name for themselves.OK, that may be a little harsh - after all, Audrey Tatou is heart-stoppingly cute, and yes, this is several trillion times better than the usual tripe that makes it to your local multiplex. But I defy you to feel a massive tinge of disappointment, if you watch this back-to-back with Delicatessen, or even New Cinema Paradiso.	3.0	Try Delicatessen, or 'Cinema Paradiso' instead	2004-08-14	9	4	5

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2SBGTE825H1N3	ANDY COLE	Amelie takes us to the Montmartre district of Paris to meet Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou). She has had an uncomfortable childhood - her mother died when she was six and her father only seemed interested in checking her heart. By the age of 22, she is a waitress, and seems to be going nowhere until a certain discovery changes her life forever.This is one of 2001's best-received films, and it's very easy to see why. It's a delightful trip through the life of one of the most intriguing characters to appear on screen ...Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien Resurrection) has created a fictional Paris, much like Baz Luhrmann's in Moulin Rouge, except not as over-the-top. Amelie, however, concentrates much more on substance than style. In fact, the special effects fit in very well. One of the film's real assets is its voiceover, which allows us to learn something about each of the characters whilst never taking itself seriously, thus providing us with some unusual comic relief. But there are many other comic moments sprinkled throughout the script - all of which are ingenious, original and very funny.A number of scenes are amazing, and some of the still shots, especially those of Amelie herself, really are a sight to behold. The editing and camerawork are deliberately overworked - it's an approach, which generally pays off, even if it occasionally confuses. Yann Tiersen's upbeat and slightly melodramatic score successfully blends in with the mood of the film.Unsurprisingly, lead actress Audrey Tautou, who bears more than a passing resemblance to another famous Audrey (Hepburn), leaves the longest lasting impression. She is luminous, charismatic, and successfully allows us to believe in all sides of Amelie's character - the reclusive, the likeable and the mischievous. Her BAFTA nomination was well deserved.Amelie's success doesn't revolve completely around Tautou, however. Mathieu Kassovitz, who plays Amelie's eventual love interest, Nino, also excels in his role, and the rest of the cast successfully fall into place, with especially notable displays from Serge Merlin and Rufus. Every major character in the film has a back-story, and Jeunet aims to ensure that we develop sympathy or hatred for them, depending on their characteristics. And we do.Amelie's only fault (and this is a minor one) is that the early parts of the film perhaps aren't as emotionally involving as they could be. Also, the sentimentality and foreign nature may put off some people. But who cares? Most go to the cinema for feel-good experiences, and it's doubtful that you will find a better one ... Capable of holding your attention throughout while simultaneously making you laugh (or even cry), Amelie makes for a perfect night out at the cinema.  --This review refers to the theatrical release.	5.0	Best movie of 2001	2002-02-25	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3VEPUOEY6T7YV	Angela M. Harkins	"I'm a visual communication student, and I watched ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain"" (2001) for my films studies class. It was amazing! It's a wonderfully quirky, magical realism film that's great for learning about mise-en-sc&egrave;ne (lighting, setting, props, etc.)I especially love the device used to introduce new characters by giving a list of the things which they do not and do like. For instance, take the introduction of Am&eacute;lie's father as a person who does not like peeing next to someone, catching scornful glances at his sandals, or clingy, wet swim trunks. He does, however, like peeling off large pieces of wallpaper, lining up and shining his shoes, and reorganizing his toolbox.This way of looking at the world is quite novel. The new way of looking at life intrigued the world, too, as proven through Am&eacute;lie's garnered recognitions in areas related to mise-en-sc&egrave;ne such as a nomination for an Oscar in the category of ""Best Art Direction-Set Decoration,"" a win for the BAFTA Film Award in the category of ""Best Production Design,"" and another win for France's C&eacute;sar Award also in the category of ""Best Production Design"" (""Awards for Am&eacute;lie (2001)""). All of these awards seem quite well deserved if ""Am&eacute;lie"" could make even one audience member look at the objects and people around him through a bit more of a hopeful and magical lens--and ""Am&eacute;lie"" managed to do that for people all over the world.It's also a great way to practice my French listening skills from native speakers, all in a very entertaining way.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	From beginning to ending, this is by far one of the finest movies I have seen in a long time.  At once humorous and quaint, yet poignant and stirring, it follows the story of a young girl to early womanhood and how she seeks to fill the void in her life.  The void is companionship and the method is by making other people's lives more complete and happy.Am&eacute;lie has no friends in her childhood, thanks to a series of weird and comical events.  She grows up to work as a waitress in a bistro and begins to see opportunities to help others reclaim their own lives and dignity.  Her only downside is her lack of happiness in her own life, though her attempts and helping others temporarily fill that need.  Then, a stranger finds his way into her pantheon of daily routine and her own shyness and timidness take over.  The result is not what you would expect, though.Towards the end you are waiting for the depressing climax, but instead... well, I won't ruin it for you, suffice to say that once things start falling into place, the picture is complete.Great acting all around, intelligent and beautiful cinematography and a compelling story make this alone a truly outstanding movie.  What I also found most intriguing was the Parisian setting without once really seeing the Eiffel Tower, instead preferring to dwell on the lesser known cityscapes and French countryside scenes.  It is smart, cute, witty and a wonderful watch that will have you laughing out loud and feeling very fulfilled at the end.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1YC9XEDFKXPLK	Armando M. Mesa	"Once in a long while a movie filled with quirkiness, eccentricity, and dark humor will creep into my ""must see"" rentals list...Amelie was definitely one of them.Even the front dvd cover packaging grabs your attention (it's very reminiscent of either a Pixar Bug's Life dvd cover or a Walt Disney film release cover of the 60's).After hearing the Oscar buzz about this off beat French comedy I needed to find out for myself what the big deal was. Well, for starters it has a pretty French actress named Audrey Tautou who has definitely captured my attention (beautiful dark eyes and plenty of skillful talent on screen)! The acting chemistry between Audrey Tatou and director/actor Mathieu Kassovitz was perfect and authentic (they really looked like a good couple);Very believable...The story centers around a meek and introverted waitress who cherishes her solitude...That is until she discovers that she has quite an uncanny knack for bringing great cheer and happiness to others concerning matters of the  heart. However, the real comedy comes into play when Amelie retaliates against those who take great sadisitic pleasure in harrassing the under dogs ! While she accomplishes these great feats through well calculated yet very eccentric methods she is unable to bring herself to find her own personal happiness with the opposite sex.She is able to play Dear Abby in a very enigmatic way to those who do not suspect she is helping them, yet is unable to follow her own advice !...Amelie is rich with colorful characters and witty (French) dialogue. Non-human characters from Amelie's vivid imagination come to life with remarkable computer animated graphics. The French location and scenery is truly amazing ! One can even feel the wind blowing on several scenes where Amelie's father's home is located (just check out the garden scene where he is accepting mail from the postman and you'll know what I mean)! Amelie is beautifully crafted and filmed in richly saturated colors for the dvd format. The 5.1 surround digital mix isn't too shabby, either. Just listen to the deep bass sound effect emitted when Amelie's mother encounters an ...well, I can't tell you, just see the dvd (this particular scene makes good use of the .1 digital bass as well as the term ""dark humor"")!...If there is one foreign ""must see"" film on your list this year, make it Amelie."	4.0	Quirkiness At It's Best !	2002-10-09	2	1	1

This is one of those films that gives a knowing wink at the audience while creating a great self-contained world that operates within its own sensibilities.As for the DVD extras, I didn't bother watching them.

The cintematography is amazing and the story is sweet. I could just watch the movie without any sound, but really and the movie would still be captivating. The settings, the props, the clothing..... everything, down to the tiniest detail was important to the people working on this film and it shows. There is absoltley nothing gratuitus about this movie. I have heard people say they have turned it off within the first few minutes because of this, and I must say they are wrong. There is absolutely nothing bad in this film. There is one scene which mentions orgasms.... but come on, exactly what is the problem with this? The story is about life, love and how the little things matter.The only problem with the American DVD version at least is that the translation is very wrong at certain points. I can't understand how some of them were made, but it is not a major problem.If you like Amelie, you would probably like L'argent de Poche(translated as Small Change, even though, again, I don't agree with the translation........ I sound very uppity, sorry reader).	5.0	Great movie. Classic:)	2002-08-04	20	17	3
B0000640VO	Amelie	AJQ1S39GZBKUG	"A. T. A. Oliveira ""A. T. A. Oliveira"""	Vive L'Amour! Vive Paris! This sunny and funny picture is one of the best of 2001. `Am&eacute;lie' --both the movie and the character -- is smart and very enchanting. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's fable has universal proportions, once it deals with love and the desire of happiness, that exist in almost every human being.It is the story of a very well meaning girl who tries to happy everybody around -- herself included-- and sometimes she succeds, but sometimes she fails. Having a difficult and lonely childhood the woman Am&eacute;lie has a simple and meaningless life, until one day she founds a mysterious box inside a bathroom wall. She promises that if she succeds in findinf the owner of the box, she will do good things forever. If she fails: unlucky world!! To put in a nutshell: she finds the owner and her life will never be the same. Neither her father's, her friends', and any one else's who `dares' to cross her way.Am&eacute;lie's attitude reminded me very much of Jane Austen's Emma. Both girls try to fix up everybody's life but ends up doing mistakes. However I think Am&eacute;lie is a bit less naive than Emma.The characters are very well developed. And no one finishes the movie in the same way he/she began. Of course Am&eacute;lie is the one who has the most dramatic changing. But all the others find some joys in their simple life, and from that time on, life, love, friendship will never be the same again.Audrey Tatou is nothing but perfect. She is beautiful and charming. Sometimes she may look like a femme fatale, but she can perfectly be a unprotected child looking for some love. Her eyes are so beautiful and expressive that they dominate the screen in some scenes. Even in the film poster, I think the eyes are the first thing we see. Mathieu Kassovitz is also very good as Am&eacute;lie's love interest: Nino. He is naive but not silly or stupid. They make a perfect couple. The supporting cast is also very nice. Every character has his/her charms and dramas, that will only be solved with our heroine's help.The Paris where this fable takes place is a dream land. It is clean and beautiful. The sky is like in heaven. The whole film comes down to be Parisian. More than an way of life, it is a philosohie. People there are different, they think and look different. Moreover, Paris is still the Capital of Love.Another interesting thing in this picture is the photograph. The lighting is very peculiar. CGI can be very usefull sometimes-- it can have other uses than creating dinossaurs. Since the beginning, one can notice it is a one-of-a-kind movie. But it couldn't be different. Director Jeunet is known to be very focused on details, and here every detail counts. To make things much better, the soundtrack is fabulous! The songs perfectly fit every scene, and Paris as well.After 2001, with `Am&eacute;lie' and `Moulin Rouge', Montmartre is back again as a place of bohemian, love, dance and colourful sets. People there are better, more beautiful and lovable. To sum up,  this is a charming movie that is recommend for all ages. Mainly for those who are young at heart. It is impossible not to leave the cimena smiling.	5.0	C&#65533;est bonne, La Vie	2002-02-11	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	Amelie is a charming film from innovative French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children, Alien:Resurrection) starring a lovely doe-eyed Audrey Tautou.  In telling the tale of kindness and relationships, this movie has the unique look of Jeunet's other films (and uses many of the actors we've seen in his earlier work) with characters and situations that are more accessible.Special features include: a commentary track with Jeunet, in French or English; a featurette, 'The Look of Amelie'; outtakes; screen tests by Audrey Tautou (Amelie), Urbain Cancelier (the abusive greengrocer) and Yolande Moreau (the lovelorn concierge); Q&amp;A sessions with Jeunet or with Jeunet and cast members; a storyboard comparison of the scene in which Amelie rides through the funhouse; an intimate chat with Jeunet, in which he describes the process of getting the film made, its snubbing at Cannes, and its subsequent commercial and critical success; 'Home Movies', inside the making of the film; French and American trailers and tv spots; a scrapbook; and cast and crew filmographies.I think Jeunet is the most interesting French director working today.  Amelie is visually dazzling and narratively both compelling and charming. The special features are plentiful and interesting, and make the dvd version worthwhile, particularly if you are interested in the work of this fine director.Highly recommended.	5.0	charming story, breathtaking visuals and terrific dvd extras	2002-08-10	13	9	4

B0000640VO	Amelie	AATNXK0OQ4O0T	"A. Wilson ""swirleez"""	What can I say - this film is a delectable treat. When the lights came up in the theatre, I walked outside, and truly considered wheedling my way into the next sold-out show.Even on the day after, I am still thinking of the stories, understories, images, and utterly charming sequences that compose this film, and I find myself giggling - with a heart that suddenly has wings. It sounds corny and unbelievable, but it is true.I visited Paris this summer and &quot;Amelie&quot; was playing there - one of my good friends who lives in Paris, told me then that the film was completely fantastic and a must-see. I took her word for it, and have not been disappointed in the slightest. In fact, I wrote to thank her this morning for recommending such a wonderful way to spend two hours. I have now taken it on myself to call and email many friends to recommend the film in turn.The story is magical, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the whimsical elements make you bubble with laughter. It seems like an odd pairing, but Jeunet's meticulous, and usually dark visual detail works perfectly with this airy adventure. From the beautiful city-scapes, the the wonderful close-ups of the characters, the art direction seduces the viewer into complete submission, and you will probably never want to be released.From the first moments you catch your breath, and when you leave again you feel like you just learned how to breathe.	5.0	Magnifique!	2001-11-12	16	13	3
B0000640VO	Amelie	AGG9C66TOLJZB	"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list"""	You can almost smell Paris in this beautiful, rich and fun film. Amelie is a lonely girl who grows into a quiet adult - whose life is small and neat - but whose past has been somewhat fraught and misunderstood. A chance event sends her life spinning off into a parallel existence - one in which she realises she can quietly do good for other people without seeking reward - and it also helps her find love.Now that is the barebones of the story - but it in no way actually manages to capture how wonderful this film is. It is sweet, shoulder-shruggingly gallic film - where everything is open to gentle ridicule from the argumentative old house-wives to the nature of Ameilie's mothers' death. (killed by a woman falling from a Cathedral). As Amelie tries to organise true love she realises that this is the one thing you cannot organise - for if you help it along it will not necessarily turn out  - and you cannot avoid it if it is meant to be.I didn't think I would like this film at all. I thought it would be meaningful and poignant and have long lingering silences and then try to carry it off by having a gamine heroine for the lead. Well it has the Hepburn-esque heroine, but the movie is just a joy from start to finish. LIght, refreshing and one I will happily watch again.	5.0	Rich imagery and colour but it never forgets the story	2002-12-09	1	1	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3OHNKP6HX8C9K	balefireelegy	This film was enjoyable and that made it worth the money spent.  The Characters of Amelie and her true love were both figures I can relate to... being someone who frequently inhabbits the border between reality and imagination.  Some people complain about the way the film plays out... the predictability of it all... how it seems to drag forever until they finally hook up... these were grievences I had when i first started watching this movie... but I found that now I care not.THe visions in this movie are amazing.  In the series of narrtives we get about Amelie's childhood are expecially funny, as are all the things she imagines.  I especially liked the insights that you got into characters lives.  Some of them were small and odd (like someone who only likes popping bubble wrapp) but made sense in a weird kind of way.Another comment frequently made is how unrealistic the portrayel of Paris is... my reponse... It's not supposed to be realistic... little is... the Main Character's world view is skewed by her nature.  Both her and the Male lead character saw the world through rose tinted lenses, and this is what we are shown.Also of note is the score/soundtrack of the film which also plays an important role in creating the overall sense of feeling and emotion.Anyway... ONce again... if you can suspend your belief in reality and just let the movie sweep you up... You'll come down smiling..	5.0	Simply because it makes me SMILE	2003-05-08	1	1	0

If you watch it, pay attention to the photography. Nearly every frame is a watercolor painting come to life, even the most mundane scenes.Take, for instance, the snippet where Amelie encounters the man playing the record player in the subway. Look at the colors, and how even the buttons on the man's coat echoes the peas in the painting behind him. Look, too, at the colors in the concierge's apartment and in the park -- everywhere! It is a feast for the eyes!The colors and compositions are astounding, and the acting -- right down to the most minor characters -- is superb. Yet, I found the characterization and plot somewhat empty. It's all very cute and all, with Amelie going around trying to &quot;fix&quot; up people's lives, but it drags on way too long and ultimately ends on a rather meaningless note.It's more than mere eye candy -- but less than a truly fulfilling film.	4.0	Visually stunning - but the plot?	2003-12-07	0	0	0

A treat for the mind, soul, eyes, &amp; ears: delicious interiors drenched in lush colors (mostly reds and greens), a spirited soundtrack (lots of zesty accordion - but don't let you that put you off), an amusing cast of quirky characters, enchanted - and some rather disenchanted - romance, and a dash of intriguing mystery.Young Amelie is a shy doe-like creature, the hapless offspring of two human oddities. One day she is struck with a revelation when she discovers a little boy's long lost box of treasures hidden in a secret compartment in her bathroom. Once she anonymously returns the item to the boy, who by now is middle-aged, and witnesses from afar his joy, she sets out on a quest to right the wrongs of her fellow human beings (even imagining herself as Zorro in one scene).Along the way, Amelie stumbles across her soul mate who devotes much of his time scavenging for discarded strips of photos from photo booths and saving them in a scrapbook. Hmmmm, interesting hobby, oui? But will Amelie ever muster up the courage to actually encounter him face to face?Ah, and what does Princess Diana's death have to do with any of these shenanigans? And who is the Glass Man and why does he paint the same thing over and over again? Who is the bald man in the red sneakers who seems obsessed with having his photo taken yet never keeps any of them? Will the nitwit with the tape recorder ever stop stalking Gina? Can anything cure Georgette's many maladies? Why would Suzanne rather eat human flesh than horse flesh? What happened to papa's garden gnome? And what on earth is hidden beneath the artichoke?Watch this movie, folks, and find out the answers to these captivating enigmas and more. So so much more. I truly don't believe you'll be sorry.	5.0	Deliciously Irresistible Treat	2004-05-21	8	6	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2HL7R8R23NERT	Bart King	"The original title of this film was ""The Fabulous Destiny of Am&eacute;lie Poulain"" (""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain""), a name which tipped off the viewer that the story was somewhere between a tall tale and a fable. So for those who might be a little thrown by Am&eacute;lie's surreal and staccato opening exposition, hang in there and let the movie catch you in its rhythm.As I haven't expressed it yet, this is the best movie I've seen in at least a year. In fact, AMELIE is so scintillating, it would be pointless for me to try to explain or analyze its magic. Yes, the movie has appealing and eccentric characters who are perfectly cast, and a whimsical storyline that manages to be charming instead of fey, and an absolutely gorgeous color palate. But perhaps most amazingly, it's a goodhearted French film without meandering conversations OR heavy cigarette smoking. Now that's an accomplishment!SIDELIGHT: I don't know that I've ever seen a film that used its special effects in such a judicious way, a way that furthers the story and helps cast the movie's spell without drawing undue attention to itself."	5.0	"""It's better to help people than garden gnomes"""	2006-07-29	3	3	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	AKJXIL2VS3Y36	Basil Nestor	Amelie is a highly stylized fable, from a director who made his name in television commercials, so it's whimsical, visual, fantastical, fast-paced and super-saturated with information. For some viewers this may be a bit tedious, becoming tiresome with all of the mega-input. But if you like the fast pace of the Simpsons, or Family Guy, or a typical Federal Express commercial, then you'll love Amelie. It's sort of a live-action cartoon. Amelie is a charming story about a lonely and shy French girl who learns how to love by doing good things for others. It won a ton of awards when it was released, and those accolades were deserved. There is nothing &#34;real&#34; about it except for the tears it will bring to your eyes as Amelie goes through her ups and downs. It's a beautiful movie about fantasy, and the deep truth that can be wrapped in a good fable. I recommend this.	4.0	A Beautiful Movie!	2014-06-27	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1EI65WJC85U68	"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k"""	Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tatou) is an attractive but introverted young woman from a highly dysfunctional family; in flashbacks we see her parents give her a camera and then tell her after a car accident that her photography caused it. Her family life is so bad even her pet goldfish has suicidal tendencies. But Amelie finds herself finally freed from these burdens when her mother commits suicide.Flash forward five years later to late 1997 and Amelie is working as a waitress. However hearing the news of Princess Diana's death changes her life forever and she decides to devote herself to being a self appointed guardian angel, subtly changing people's lives for the better (or worse) without their knowledge. But despite these noble (Yet somehow, below the surface; megalomaniacal) efforts, Amelie remains living in her dream world. Can she find the love and happiness for herself that she so passionately seeks for others?AMELIE is sometimes pretentious, but mostly a very unique and charming fable which effortlessly mixes fantasy and whimsy, with a wonderful lead performance from Tatou. Directed by Jean Pierre Jeunet, best known for DELICATESSEN and ALIEN RESURRECTION. This is well worth your time. I avoided renting AMELIE for ages because the cover and concept screamed ARTHOUSE CHICK FLICK, but thankfully the movie is far from it. Normally I'd hate this type of movie, but AMELIE is different. I'd even go so far as to say it's actually quite special. Well worth checking out.	4.0	A charming film for those who want something different	2003-02-23	15	2	13
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1RKD1I8MW1LG6	BeachReader	What can I possibly add to all the accolades already given for this movie? 360 reviews!!!!An incredible viewing experience, a lovely and charming story, and the amazing face of Audrey Tautou who speaks volumes with her eyes and facial expressions. Some of her experiences are almost surreal and definitely magical. I smile whenever I think of this movie, which is smart, enormously likable, and visually interesting.Amelie's desire to do good and make others happy creates a touching story of the triumph of good. She accomplishes her goals via complex strategies, and always anonymously. There is no preaching, just a fast-paced story enhanced by a fantastic star and numerous interesting sub-plots.The one thing Amelie has the most trouble with is mustering enough courage to let a young man, Nino, know how she feels about him. Both of them are too shy to approach each other directly, which leads to some funny scenes.Sit back and enjoy this feel-good movie, which I intend to watch again ASAP.	5.0	What Can I Possibly Add?	2002-07-27	2	1	1

Audrey Tautou is the most beautiful, magnetic, spellbounding, and (insert any other positive superlative adjectives here) actress since Audrey Hepburn.  My only hope is that Hollywood never gets its filthy hands on her.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet's style sucks you in completely. The supporting cast also give excellent performances.  I was worried that I would not get the French sense of humor going into this movie,  but I quickly found out that would not be the case.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2NN6Z6HO3Z7CK	"Ben Finklea ""Husband, Father, CEO, Author"""	There are two French movies that I consider must-see: The Grand Illusion and Amelie. Amelie is funny, sad, happy, romantic, mysterious, strange, absurd, sexy, cute, and just fun. Brief synopsis: Innocent Amelie is trying to find the mystery of happiness and this is the story of what happens on the journey. What made the movie for me was the way each character is described in intimate detail. I've never seen this technique used before. Basically, the movie pauses when you meet a central character and you are told about his/her background, habits, likes, dislikes, etc. Besides being very funny, it brings you even closer to Amelie's world. One last thing: The bit with the garden gnome is worth the price of the ticket! See it, buy it.	5.0	Simply Fantastic	2001-11-04	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2HPUBAJYTJKLP	Benjamin Denes	'Amelie' is one magical movie. It doesn't just present likable characters and an endearing story, but is gorgeous to look and listen at. The story revolves around Amelie, a lonely woman from France who one day takes it upon herself to make other people happy. Whether it's returning a childhood treasure to it's elderly owner to bringing two people together, Amelie goes about bringing just a bit of happiness to those around her. But will she find it herself?For those who have seen the 'Delicatessan' and 'City of Lost Children' before, director Jeunet brings the same aesthitics to 'Amelie' as he did to those films. Each scene is beautifully filmed, with CG effects thrown in here and there to spice up some of the scenes. There are only a few primary colours used in each shot, but it works well giving the film a look of it's own.The actors are great as well, each one performing the individually appealing characters perfectly.The 2 disc set also comes with an extra's laden disc filled with trailers, featurettes and interviews that definately make this a worthwhile film to get.	5.0	Beautiful movie will make you smile	2002-07-27	1	0	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	I've seen &quot;Amelie&quot; six times in the theater and countless times on DVD. Each time I've watched it, I've introduced it to a different friend, usually someone who doesn't watch foreign films. &quot;Amelie&quot; works its spell every time, simply because it's about deciding to do good things for other people, finding a soulmate yet having chance bring you together and finding delight in life's smaller moments.Beautifully filmed on location in Montmarte, France, the director Jean Pierre Jeunet began planning it while working in America on &quot;Alien Resurrection,&quot; compiling a list of all the things he loved about his area, all the things he'd ever wanted to film, and he built the story around those images. (Thus, we get the bits about the glasses dancing, the nuns working on their backhand.)He uses his gift for visual effects and his love of Paris to create this film, which is as charming as every review has said. Audrey Tautou is instantly lovable. She's, at times, childish yet scheming. The schemes she devises are hysterical, and the film's underlying themes of kindness and hope resonate.	5.0	Cheers you up even when you're already in a good mood.	2003-01-07	9	8	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	AYXP2J1A8YS6X	Bernard	I have seen thousands of films in my life, and thought nothing could surprise me anymore on a screen. Amelie proved me I was wrong. Instead of writing another &quot;best film ever&quot; comment, I would like to give some indications for non-french speaking viewers, as the translation might have made some lines a bit obscure.Amelie says to Colignon &quot;Meme les artichauds ont du coeur&quot; (Even artichokes have a heart). In french, &quot;un coeur d'artichaud&quot; (an artichoke heart) is a person that falls very often and easily in love.Colignon calls Amelie &quot;Amelie-melo&quot; (pronounce &quot;ah-may-LEE-may-low&quot;) which sounds like &quot;un meli-melo&quot;, a muddle or mix-up.In the cafe, people discuss about time and weather, as the same word &quot;temps&quot; means both &quot;le temps qui passe&quot; (time that passes) and &quot;le temps qu'il fait&quot; (the weather). So goes Hippolito's theory : they speak about the weather because they are afraid of the passing time.Collignon says about his mother : &quot;Elle a une memoire d'elephant, un elephant de mer&quot; (literally: she has memory like an elephant, a sea elephant). A &quot;sea elephant&quot; is a sort of walrus, and &quot;mer&quot; (sea) and &quot;mere&quot; (mother) are pronounced the same.When Amelie is in a theater, she watches &quot;Jules &amp; Jim&quot;, a movie by Francois Truffaut. There are many references to Truffaut in the movie : Claire Maurier plays the mother in &quot;the 400 blows&quot; and many scenes refer to &quot;Bed and Board&quot;, which itself refers to Hitchcock's &quot;Rear window&quot;. I still have to figure which was the movie whith Spencer Tracy driving without watching...When Amelie watches her projected life on TV, a scene that refers to Woody Allen's &quot;Zelig&quot;, the voice over is from Frederic Mitterand, nephew of his uncle, who is famous for commenting weddings or funerals of aristocrats on french TV.The &quot;likes/dislikes&quot; narration was experimented by Jeunet in a short movie &quot;Foutaise&quot; with Dominique Pinon, that will be included in the collector edition of the DVD. It also refers to &quot;La vie, mode d'emploi&quot; (Life: a user's manual) from Georges Perec, although Jeunet admits he could never finish the book.Most TV scenes are stock shots. The story about the horse running in the Tour de France is true. Most stories told in the film are true, including the one about collecting discarded pictures.There are numerous references in the movie, including to other Jeunet films. The scene in the mystery train is almost a copy of a similar scene in Alien : Resurrection where Ripley has an almost tender behaviour with the alien.Finally, &quot;Amelie&quot; comes from &quot;Emily&quot;, as Emily Watson was supposed to play the role, and &quot;Poulain&quot; is both a young untrained horse and a chocolate brand. And this is not a coincidence.	5.0	Tips for english viewers	2001-12-13	661	627	34

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3MPEDYM4DGS5O	BigSPEEGS	"What a fun film! From the moment it begins, ""Amelie"" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. ""Amelie"" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a naive girl working at the Two Windmills Cafe. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical ""Bells Are Ringing"", with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for ""Amelie"". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.With films like ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"", ""With a Friend Like Harry"" and box-office hit ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with ""Amelie"", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world."	4.0	Wonderful!	2002-06-01	66	59	7

The movie is interactive between real life and Amelie (main character) imagination.  This later expands to the ""prince"" in the movie.  I can appreciate it for this, but those looking for a feel good romantic comedy will not find it here!!  Plan on spending most of the movie confused.  Amelie decides to help strangers because of her disfunctional way of relating to people personally.  Amelie's progress is obviously, and condescendingly, paralleled by the painting of her equally eccentric and strange neighbor.  In fact there isn't a normal person in this movie: perhaps a feature that makes the ""cute"" to most.The main point of the movie is that Amelie, as odd as she is, can find someone equally odd.  Unfortunately the disfunctionality of both 'lovers,' while starting as a cute crush and creative chase, ends as frustratingly after several failed attempts to simply say hello.In short Amelie's disfunctional nature, and the movies obvious existential overtones,  are overstressed to the point that I want to[get sick]."	1.0	Ok....it was creative	2003-07-18	61	16	45

Am I overselling it a bit?Perhaps, but it IS a remarkable movie, an incredibly sweet, touching little story about a woman who takes it upon herself to go about changing people's lives for the better, but finds herself afraid to take bold steps in her own life.In an interview on the DVD Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet said this film came about out of a desire he had to bring something positive into the world. He succeeded beautifully. In addition to a tender story about love and courage, this is a strikingly visual film. Jeunet's use of color and angles leaps off the screen the way very few American movies do.

I even recommend this movie for teens/tweens despite the &#34;R&#34; rating; the rating is due to the nature of the adult shop where Nino works and two brief scenes depicting...ahem...&#34;intimate moments&#34; in the beginning. If parents are uneasy with their kids seeing it, it's easily remedied by putting a hand over their eyes for a few minutes.The directing is superb and the film's story really plucks at the chords of both heart and funny-bone.

I mean, come on, another movie by two Bosnians nobody heard making another low-budget, low-watched,movie about the war in Kosovo.  Amelie was truly inspirational, innovative, creative, moving film that as Gosford Park actor, Ryan Phillipe stated eloquently, ""took me to another place and time.""I mean, I'm sure the Bosnian film was well done and all, but every year it seems there's a come out of nowhere film about a war in Bosnia by a couple guys whose names you can't pronounce being nominated every year for the foreign film category. Wasit the same guys doing every year? Was this a Randy Newman thing where if you keep on doing the same thing long enough, the Academy gives it to you just for the heck of it?Sheesh, anyway, the movie is simply wonderful, innovative, and a refreshingly artistic movie that gives its viewers a break from the usual Tom Green High School Flick, Mel Gibson war-militarization-patriotism- flick, and the Jim Carrey is this funny flick.

Be sure to check out the shoes she wears in every scene.

She sets out to make her world a better place by doing good for other people, succeeding greatly with each effort yet not really trying to improve upon her own life. There's another equally odd person that she's known since childhood and loved all the while. She freezes up whenver she nears him and runs off in a panic. This was an all around great movie.

The cinematography and the meaning of small details in this (and in many other so called ""foreign"" movies) is unparalled.  American movies are generally too commercialized, airheaded and generally showing  norrow perspectives (few exceptions exist, of course).  In contrast, Amelie shows how normal, blue collar young people enjoy life in a meaningful way and best of all, they end as happy people while being financially poor.  No SUV's, a mini-vans, shopping malls, air-head teenagers, ""perfect body"" dudes or gals, exercised obsessed people, REAL cafe's (not that cheap imitation called Starbucks), and the list never ends.

The ""Look of Amelie"" shows how precise and prepared the director was and the cinematographer actually steals the show with his explanation of various shots and scenes.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A8NMHEHDYJ5OU	Brian McInnis	Thirty-five. That is the approximate number of times I was obliged to bellow the usual two-word, seven-letter refrain at the screen while watching this abomination of cinema. That would bring the total number of instances I've bellowed this phrase at a movie to perhaps forty. This could be the most aggressively, nauseatingly saccharine film ever made and watching it is like being gassed with whimsy and sat on by a giant Teddy bear.Every other movie I've ever seen is a better movie than 'Amelie', but it will appeal very well to people who'd rather live in a different universe. It picks up real, living humans and uses them like toys, like terminally uninformed parodies of humanity. It squanders reality. See that bar-maid there? That actress playing her is probably a fascinating woman - I'm SURE she's a fascinating woman - people tend heavily to be fascinating. Sadly though, this cartoon of a film allows no manifestation of any side of any of its performers' personalities to show through at any point. I have never, ever been more infuriated by a movie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's previous film was 'Alien: Resurrection', which goes part-way, but not all the way, toward explaining why this movie is as bad as it is.Although there is ever so much more to be said, that's about all I'm going to say about 'Amelie'. I'd like to tell you that this is because the film's Hadesian wretchedness is beyond my ability to properly describe, but that would constitute a falsehood on the scale of 'Amelie'. The truth is that I am dismayed by the idea of exerting any more mental energy contemplating this grotesque puppet show. That the film receives such unbroken acclaim is a dreary testament to the desire of so very many people for movies that provide an escape from any form of recognizable life. For Jean-Pierre Jeunet to spit in my face would be so much kinder than what he did to me by making this movie it would constitute an atonement.(Note: Buried in the film's sound-track is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard; a version of 'Guilty' sung by Albert Bowlly in 1931. An acquaintance haplessly gave this film to me, and afterwards I told her that, although it was the single most detestable film I'd ever seen, without it I'd surely have gone the rest of my days without having heard that sublime melody, and was grateful to her. My relationship with that song will end only at the hour of my death, unlike my relationship with this film and its director, which terminates with the completion of this sentence.)	1.0	Reality Squandered	2012-05-28	31	4	27

I tend to equate the words &quot;date movie&quot; with &quot;chick flick.&quot; This film will hopefully help me resolve these personal issues.&quot;Amelie&quot; was my introduction to Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Having now seen this film as well City of Lost Children, I can only say that I hold him in only slightly less regard than God. &quot;Creative Genius&quot; is a term all too bandied about in reviewland, yet it applies in this instance. I can't say that Amelie &quot;changed my life,&quot; but it definitely gave me a fresh perspective.One of the characteristics I've noticed in the two Jeunet films I've watched, involves his use of interconnecting threads in an otherwise juxtaposed or fractured story line. This is not exactly a unique technique in recent cinema. Paul Thomas Anderson used it quite effectively in &quot;Magnolia.&quot; Likewise David Lynch in &quot;Mullholand Drive,&quot; for just two examples. Jeunet surpasses all of them, however, in terms of playfulness and sheer directorial instinct. It owes also to a sensibility in French cinema that hearkens back most directly to the Jaques Tati era.The artistic marriage of such an artfully clever director with an actress (Audrey Tautou) seemingly born to play a role can best be chalked up to kismet, synchroneity, harmonic convergence, whatever. I'm just glad they got together, for they make for an irresistable combo.Highest marks for camera work, script, direction, acting, DVD transfer. This is the whole package. Don't let anything put you off from securing this grand-slam of a film.

Nino works in a porn shop (though it is surprisingly un-seedy), and other characters have their problems (though they seem surprisingly easy to solve by our irrepressible heroine).  Amelie is a sweet, Ally McBeal-esque girl who has never really grown up.  She is still the little girl who lives in a world of her own imagination.  And if those glasses are rose-coloured, who are we to say that the way she sees the world is worse than the more pessimistic brand of cynicism that seems to be so rampant in &quot;realism&quot; today?  Amelie reminds us that perhaps, after all, the children, with their innocent idealism and little games, have somehow got it right.Both Amelie and her accidental &quot;amoureux&quot; are adorable, though I thought perhaps Jeunet might have taken a cue from Jane Austen and pointed out that Amelie's interference with other people's lives, like Emma, sometimes turned out badly (like Georgette and her psychotic lover), and Amelie should have taken some responsibility for that.  But perhaps that is my North American liberalism speaking.  I loved the integration of the fantasy with reality: talking pig-lamps, the photographs that speak to Nino about the &quot;beautiful&quot; mysterious girl....are they merely manifestations of Nino and Amelie's subconscious thought, or is destiny really working miracles to bring them together?  And it is the pointing out of the details of life that holds the movie together in terms of story.  After all, most people's stories are manifested through the details...this is the stuff life (or at least an ideal one) is made of...c'est la vie.  And everybody, not just Amelie and Nino, has their quirks.  I thought the narrated introduction at the beginning of the film quite funny in its portrayal of the silly and the absurd that really, though exaggerated, makes up much of our lives.  And the characters!  Oh the characters!  There's not a sane one in the lot (it has been said that the French have their own distinct brand of madness..j/k)!  Nevertheless, we see echos of people we know in each of them, in the jealous boyfriend, the angry grocer, the kind painter, etc.  And perhaps there is an Amelie in some of us too, shy introverts who think up strategems to avoid confronting our true passions.Last but not least, the cinematography is excellent.  It may not be realistic (I lived in Paris for a few years and it isn't), but it's a pretty fantasy of an Ideal Paris.All in all, it's a satisfying fantasy with a happy ending.  And in these days, don't we all need some more happy endings?	5.0	happy and entertaining	2002-12-10	20	19	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3EV0UPWND877H	"Campbell Roark ""tri-zeta"""	...And just about everyone else, too. Whatever baggage you may or may not have concerning foreign films- drop it now. Amelie is perhaps the most exuberant, stylish and joyful film to pop along in ages. Lovingly made: the acting, the shot composition, the editing and the (very, very) subtle use of CGI...Widescreen is a must for this one, as much of the film's beauty is chopped out in the VHS release (such as one scene, where Amelie is sitting in front of the TV in a room that's nigh entirely red- save for a small blue lamp to her left. It's a tiny detail, but it fleshes out everything wonderfully- closed captioned: the lamp is gone). Little things, definitely. But then, this is a movie that is all about the tiny details in life...Yes, it's a love story, and as sweet as they come. No need to further belabor that aspect or give away any moments. But you will be surprised many times over. You will laugh at loud. And you will want to watch it again and again, especially with someone you can touch close by. And if you don't have someone- this movie may provide the much-needed impetus to go to France and start turning (not to mention skipping) stones (the shots of the city are marvellous).Then there's Audrey Tautou, whose expressive face is the axis of the movie. Amelie holds your gaze like a naissance de millennium Audrey Hepburn. She has an elfin grace that is utterly sublime and unique. When Amelie smiles, you smile with her.I could gush about this for a long, long time. Rarely do I see a film that brings out the child-like optimist and romantic in me- I tend to go for the unflinching, unredemptive view of humanity (Requiem for a dream and Happiness are two good examples).If you have seen it, then you know why you should get this one- movies like this simply aren't made that often. Especially with such skill and flair (this was, I believe, Jeunet's first film sans Caro ((they did 'the city of lost children' and 'delicatessen,' both great films!)) and the cinematographer's first feature period, though I may be mistaken...)If you haven't seen it- trust a stranger. This film will add something light and hopeful and precious to your life.	5.0	A movie for people who love movies...	2004-04-20	1	1	0

I was plesantly surprised when I saw it finally on VHS. The characters are very likable and well developed. The filiming is beautiful, with rich colors, interesting special effects and animations and intersting characters throughout.

Even my husband, who won't sit still for subtitled movies, liked it and chuckled a few times as I saw him watch the movie over his newspaper! (And, not to take anything away from either actress, but Audrey Tautou reminded me of another famous Audrey. She had that same &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot;. That's the limit of my high school French!) The movie has what is missing in so many American movies and that is multi-layers-- mini-stories that don't detract from the main story but add a lot to it. The only bad thing I can say was I had a heck of a time accessing the subtitles and getting them in English. Maybe the DVD (a rental) had a glitch in it but it wasn't a very friendly menu and unfortunately, I don't understand French well enough to follow it in a movie. Liked the music, too.

Let me suggest that if you enjoyed ""Chocolat,"" you really ought to immerse yourself in the charms of ""Amelie."" The title character is immensely likeable as she mischievously goes about bringing a little love and happiness into the lives of friends and strangers alike. And don't get on her bad side, or she'll mess with your reality! This movie also has a remarkably high-tech look to it, with its cutting-edge film techniques and sparing use of CGI.

Reading the subtitles was almost unnoiticible, and didn't distract from the movie's charm. Amelie is a hilarious movie about a 20-something girl who decides one day to become a regular good-doer, to help mankind. The film then takes you on an adventure through Amelie's puzzling love life, friendships, and her random acts of kindness. The message of the movie: Don't take life's simple pleasures for granted.The DVD included great, helpful extras as well as the disc. The best part of the movie was by far how beautiful it was to watch. The cinematography was excellet, every take could have been a bright, beautiful picture.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1TP3ZYYNA6KNE	"Carlos G. Diaz ""losman"""	Amelie is a wonderful and sensible little film about a wonderfully simple young woman. Amelie was born to parents who seemed more concerned about their careers than about her. Her lack of attention and over protective upbringing will lead to her shy and quiet manner.As an adult Amelie lives a simple life as a waitress, she finds pleasure in simple observations and skipping stones along Paris famous canals. Yet her simple life is changed upon the news of Lady Diana's tragic death. An accident reveals a serendipitous discovery that leads her to bring joy to those around her and avenge those who have made her miserable. Her good deeds are elaborate, almost Rube Goldberg like in their complexity but each one leads to happiness for the recipient. Whether it is reuniting a father with his estranged family to helping her own father pursue his dream of traveling, Amelie uses this newfound courage to go out and find happiness for those around her.Directed by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Amelie is a break from his earlier surreal distopian fare (City of Lost Children, Delicatessen). In contrast Amelie is a warm and pleasant comedy that features his unique style and quirky characters without the dark and cruel background of previous works. Am&eacute;lie makes you want to smile with her frail appearance that reveals her warm heart and devilish wit, she is so full of life and yearning for adventure. Her search for other peoples happiness will lead to her own search for love but along the way she has to make that guy respect and admire her even more.	5.0	This is the real Serendipity	2001-11-19	4	4	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A27NSZP2PPGW6Z	Carra R Lane	A beautiful cinema exercise, especially fine in terms of application of digital effects & [green] processing to something NOT scifi/war/action, but a saccharin mess/miss as a fable or narrative. Or picaresque imagistic collage or whatever anyone wants to call it. Industrial cubic zirconia? Attempts at fable, especially high romantic comic fable, rise or fall by ringing true or false. Ring is subjective. Those entering darkened mall theaters seeking mysteriously empowered mischievious green fairy civility might feel/argue that it passes? But it's a video now & it's Disney/Shyamalan/Spielberg, [para-]soap operatic NOT dramatic, tightly controlled/artificial NOT loosely natural/inviting, seriously charming self-indulgence in the service of something archly/Frenchly infantile? Occasional flash refs to earthbound sex & the vagaries/glitches of mating are perfunctory. Amelie is Pollyanna with Tinkerball traces? Titania denatured, minus flashy temper & capacity for selfish caprice? Jeunet may feel that one must choose to make either a nice (positive is his usual English word) OR a NOT nice movie, that a natural mix is just too difficult/confusing for movie audiences? Perhaps he's right?Jeunet claims quasi-autobiographical basis for tales/episodes (other than the old globetrotting gnome trick), & DVD bonus stuff provides all sorts of hints/clues about why Jeunet, like many other auteurs, might be wise to depend more upon others for stories/scripts? The game SEEMS Puckish enough on its surface, but it gets worse as it goes, loses its force as Amelie herself is dolled up/out/down past either traditional fairy/witch or merely human, finally centered in an other-obliterating way? All males are caricatured. Amelie's eventual love object Nino is especially weak, pure cipher, as if projecting Amelie & girls from his right brain exhausted Jeunet entirely. No real Bottom, so neither here nor there, neither [humble/bad/sweet/stupid] play within play nor whole complex comedy? Shakespeare himself didn't have the hubris to aspire to DIRECTLY write/stage Bottom's bottomless dream? What we feel after a successful romantic comedy is an adult amazement, the effect of a mix, shaken not machined, of separate unblendably dissonant players/worlds. It can be approached ONLY by indirection, interplay? Amelie develops into Shirley Temple King Kong, way too cute/gigantic for anyone/thing else to escape her sway? NOT actress error. Writer/director (or auteur) goof. Streamed froth. Waste of technical talent, VERY Shyamalan-like.Quite pretty, though, with many gracefully framed shots of green Paris. If you can stand the bunny & teddy bear cloud effects & Jeunet's clear wish to control/do everything, you'll have fun.	2.0	Pretty in Green	2002-09-09	20	5	15

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1ER8FS19S0XY5	C.B. Derrick	One of my favorite movies of the early 00s, and seeing it again on Blu-ray was a treat. The transfer was solid (I didn't do bench mark tests or anything of that technicality, just watched it on my Samsung HDTV and remembered how it looked in the theatre and the DVD I had, but hadn't watched in like 5 or 6 years). There are some flaws that are revealed, but I think that's a function of how CGI and other VFX compositing and coloring was done when the film was produced.The story, acting and directing is all top notch, as this film put Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the height of the internationally-acclaimed filmed directors after doing director-for-hire work on ALIEN 4.Always meant to be a love letter to the City of Lights, Amelie still carries its fairy tale charm (that you'll either love or hate, I happen to love it) and Audrey Tautou shines as the titular character. The director's signature is writ at large on this film, and its style is superbly executed.The extras on this Blu-ray mimic those from the DVD (at least I think, I don't remember what was on the DVD and I don't want to look that up, because anyone can do that at DVDBeaver or some site like that with better accuracy than I can give).	5.0	A Love Letter to Paris	2013-12-08	0	0	0

The comparissons to &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; are apt. Neither's particularly concerned with the real world or with telling a story. They're simply candy-coated entertainments that you can only find at the movies. Obviously, some folks aren't going to care for &quot;Amelie.&quot; Too slight, they complain, too divorced from the problems of real life. I should note, however, that the two negative reviews I've spotted here baldly misstate some of the film's &quot;plot&quot; points and characterization, and their misreadings may have contributed to their dislike of the film. &quot;Amelie&quot; is pure pleasure, not for the jaded or the ponderers.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1U0HC6Z37DUZ0	Chris Frost	This film was my first time ever watching a foreign film, and I was surely impressed.  I've already watched it countless times, and it has yet to grow old.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet certainly has a talent for story-telling, as evidenced by this film.  Audrey Tautou is absolutely wonderful in her portrayal of Amelie Poulain, a lonely girl who has decided to become a do-gooder.  As she continues her work, she will find that what goes around really does come around, and that if you stop looking for love, it will find you.	5.0	Why can't America produce films like this??	2003-02-23	2	2	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2CKMDS10RKS50	Chris	Amelie is a fairy tale for grown-ups, a story full of lovably odd-ball characters who live in a beautiful story-book version of Paris. They are all flawed, but for the most part in charming ways. In this dreamy world Amelie is like a mostly beneficent sprite who moves through the lives of the other people, sometimes at lightning speed, doing good deeds and playing pranks that are usually harmless. At the same time, this adorable pixie is in her clumsy way searching for love with a young man that she doesn't even know. The ending is fairly predictable but getting there is so much fun, with many silly detours along the way.The only &#34;real&#34; thing in this film are the sumptuous Parisian locations. The colors are lavish and brilliant like a child's story-book, and some scenes are done in a cartoonish sped-up pace. All this makes the viewer suspend belief and revel in this happy world where good things happen to good people and even the (not so very) bad people only get a slap on the wrist.	5.0	Romantic Fantasy	2013-04-28	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A33JF14JBU4AHB	Chris Newton	I really enjoyed Amelie. It was a fun sweet romance movie with a few twists. Compared to the standard Hollywood pacing, it feels a bit slow and plodding in some spots, but the quirkiness of the side plots help keep the entertainment coming. This film though about the modern world of real people is full of fantastic little touches made possible with great cinematography and rich special effects.My only complaint isn't about the movie itself, but about the DVD. The DVD is in French, with the option to have English and Spanish subtitles. Loathe as I am sometimes to listen to overdubbed movies,I wish this DVD had the English overdub option. Reading the subtitles is a distraction from the beautiful filmwork and actors subtle visual performances.I give the DVD 4 stars, and the movie itself, 5. It may not be for everyone (my wife slept most of the way through) but fans of foreign films and independent movies may greatly enjoy it.	4.0	Fun, sweet movie	2002-07-20	7	6	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1CZICCYP2M5PX	Christian Pelchat	Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is looking for love, she`s a beautiful unique young woman with the heart of gold and maybe she perhaps looking for the meaning of life in general. We see her as a young girl, when she lost her mother and her father thinks, she has heart problems. Now as a young woman, she`s a waitress in centrail Paris. She interacts curiously with her neighbors and costumers, as well as a mysterious Photomation (Mathieu Kassovitz), an image collector and one of his even more mysterious photo subjects. Little by Little, Amelie realizes that the way to happiness (and yet more subtle humor) requires here to take her own initiative and reach out to others.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien Resurrection, The City of the Lost Children) shows visual style and plot to make this one of the most beautiful films of 2001 and also one of the year`s best films. Beautiful Performance by Tautou and also Fine Performances by Kassovitz, Rufus, Dominique Pinon and Maurice Benichou. 5 Oscar Nominations-Including:Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Sound and Best Original Screenplay. The Film has Win Four Casar Awards including:Best Director, Best Film, Best Music and Best Production Design. It was also Nominated for Best Actress:Audrey Tautou, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Supporting Actor:Jamel Debbouze also actor:Refus, Best Supporting Actress:Isabelle Nanty and Best Original Screenplay.

It is a very human story about people of ordinary means and the power of love.  It uses devices that made movies like Babe and its sequel so charming, inventive and thoughtfull, tickling the senses with its rich use of color, sound, comedy, sexuality and characterizations.  The actors all look like everyday people. Audrey Tautou is fun to watch as Amelie, and I can't help thinking that she is like a mix of Audrey Hepburn and Lucille Ball. I would pair this movie with Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Strictly Ballroom, Run Lola Run or Don Juan de Marco.	5.0	Audrey Tautou, Modern Audrey Hepburn or Lucille Ball	2003-09-08	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3NMZ95PSSUZH8	Christopher Cook	Those French, they sure know how to make a charming movie. Seeing this awhile ago in the theater in Minneapolis, I was skeptical at first on how the film would be. I have to say, though, that I was very impressed, not only by the great direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but also by every single one of the actors and actresses. Everything in the movie is set up to be almost dream-like, from the small &quot;microcosm&quot; of the neighborhood that Amelie lives in, to the the strange and believable characters that live there. Tautou gives a remarkably charming performance in the lead role. She is at once an ingenue and a dreamer, and the film captures this perfectly. Mathieu Kassovitz, of La Haine and others, fame, is also great.Having picked this DVD up while visiting in France, I was very impressed with the number of extras included, as well as eager to see how many of them would actually make it onto the US DVD release. Luckily, they all made it, a rarity for a foreign film. The transfer is great, but be a bit wary of the subtitles, they aren't all that accurate in their translation.	5.0	A Decidingly Amusing and French Film	2003-01-29	2	1	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1UKE5S6BQ33QW	Christopher Page	The movie itself was like a breath of fresh air into a stuffy, smoke filled room. The DVD was a little hard to navigate. The larger the screen you are watching the easier it will be. The menu selections on this 2 DVD set are small and cramped. Plenty of special features, though I wish they had bothered to subtitle them. Many scenes such as the outtakes are only in french. Sure I knew what was going on and what was supposed to happen, but I think they would of been more fun had I known what everyone was saying or what they all found so funny.I would recommend renting before you buy it. This film was not for everyone and this DVD does not warrant owning if you didnt like the film.	4.0	Im sure it was all intersting, but...	2002-07-16	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2RU0N2MIV0CDJ	"C. H Soto ""sharky_321"""	"Am&eacute;lie Poulin is this naive and sweet girl who has a fantastic destiny in front of her. One day, while watching the news that say that princess Diana has just died in Paris, she discovers a hole in her bathroom with tin box. In the tin box she finds someone's childhood treasure. The picture of a sports hero, a little Formula 1 car from the 50's, a little bicycle toy... Understanding just how valuable this treasure should be for the owner she sets out to find him and deliver it to him without taking any credit. Suddenly she realizes that she can help people, specially those around her.There's Madeleine, a neighbor of the building where she lives who lives depressed as her husband died while being unfaithful to her. Raymond who has a disease that makes his bones so fragile that a mere handshake could shatter his hand. He never leaves his apartment and despite painting the same Renoir picture he has never been able to get the look of one of the picture's characters right. Lucien who works at the grocery store and who has a somewhat ""romantic"" view of life but who's humiliated every day by Collingnon, the owner of the store, who enjoys making Lucien's work a miserable experience but who will run to call his mother the second he's afraid. And then there's the people who work with her at the coffee shop like one who sells the cigarettes that thinks that she has every disease imaginable but probably just needs a little love. The psychotic customer who stalks one of the waitresses that he used to date. His father who had always dreamed of making a trip around the world but discarded that idea when his wife (Am&eacute;lie's mother) died and now lives a sad and solitary life. And finally Nino who goes to every instant-photo booth in every train station and picks up the pictures that people have thrown away and collects them in an album but he wonders why a certain peron has taken his picture all around the city but always throws it away.Am&eacute;lie will help them all. And the audience will have a lot of fun watching her do it. One will cry at times but tears of joy indeed and one will laugh at times. And at the end of the movie one will cheer for her as she gets her reward because by the end of the movie she will have found her way to every spectator's heart.However the magic of the movie doesn't end just with this superb story and wonderful characters. Kudos for Jean-Pierre Jeunet on his marvelous directing. The editing techniques, the cinematographic language he uses....One critic said that Jeunet was born to direct this film Couldn't agree more. And of course the acting is superb.Fantastic movie indeed. Absolutely beautiful, a lot of fun and very charming. When the movie ends you can't get that smile out of your face and you suddenly think that as long as there's someone like Am&eacute;lie out there somewhere then this world is actually a better place that what we believe."	5.0	Absolutely fascinating.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2R4FZUQPZC3H8	C. J. Hormann	"Much crtiticism has been aimed at Jean-Pierre Jeunet for the way that he has ""tarted up"" Paris and in particular, Montmatre for this story of a day-dreaming do-gooder who cannot find her own true love (if Austen's Emma has been born a century later across the English Channel she might well be Amelie). But surely that is the point of cinema - in some part, we wish to escape the reality and drudgery of life for a couple of hours in which we can have our fantasies played out on screen. I must admit, that had I seen the Montmatre of the movie when I visited Paris in the mid-90's I might never have left.Much of the charm of this movie comes from a star-making turn by newcomer, Audrey Tatou - her dark eyes are deep wells into which this viewer would love to jump and her cheeky grin is infectious - you find yourself giving off the same grin as you watch her commit her samaritan acts or in the case of the tyrannical grocer, Collignon, bring him down a rung ot two. Of course Tatou is greatly supported by the enfant terrible of French cinema, Mathieu Kassovitz, a world away from his character in La Haine, and inhabiting the role of romantic leading man with great aplomb. Jeunet regular, Dominique Pinon and Yolande Moreau as the weeping widow/concierge add deft touches of humour to a uniformly excellent supporting cast.The look of the film is also its biggest drawcard - from the bright greens of the Metro to the fiery reds of the Porn Emporium where Nino works, the film is bathed in a glorious light and dazzles with each viewing. Jeunet came back to France after the traumatic experience of filming Alien Resurrection and with this film he shows that he can count himself amongst the great cinematic artists (along with Baz Luhrmann and Todd Haynes) working today."	5.0	The Fabulous Escapism of Amelie	2003-06-14	2	1	1

Every character in this movie has their own quirk.  When you get two or three in a room together the scene is utter madness, but very magical all the same.This is worth seeing twice, the second time just to look at all the attention to detail that went into the sets.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	It's kind of hard to tell sometimes whether a movie is trying to be too indie and smart for it's own good, or whether the movie is just charming and likable without trying to do so all along. With Amelie, there's a feeling of charm running throughout the entire thing but without feeling pre-fabricated. Jean Pierre Jeunet(he directed the awful Alien Resurrection but did do Delicatessen) made a film that shows there is still genuine filmmakers behind the camera.Amelie is a single waitress surrounded by people who need some life fixing. She finds an old box that the previous tenant from decades ago left and she decides to return it to him. This then sparks an idea to start wanting to do good to everyone else. A creepy man and a waitress get together, her widowed father who never travels lives through a garden gnome who is getting photos taken at various European sites. And there's plenty more.However she finds that her life needs some tending to as well, so enter an odd man who collects torn up photographs from those instant photo booths. Only instead of doing what others would do which is just to go up to him and talk, she takes him through a series of mini-adventures(such as a humoress one where he follows painted blue arrows only to have to run back).There's CG in the film but it's not as instrusive as one might expect. She's got a cool little pig lamp that turns itself off, photos talk back to a guy(similar in a way to Harry Potter photos), paintings converse and Amelie turns into a puddle. It's also gorgeously shot. One of my favorite shots is where she skips stones near a waterfall/dam and the camera arcs from above the waterfall to the other side just above the water. Another part of the film's charm is its star, Audrey Tautou. Like Audrey Hepburn, she's got a lovable quality where you can't help but want to watch her.If you actually start thinking of its length, it might feel long but if you really get into the film, it just flies by.	5.0	One of the delightfully quirky movies I've seen in awhile	2005-08-05	3	2	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	This is a jewel of a film. At times quirky and sentimental without being mawkish, ~Amelie~ is a cinematic experience which transports the viewer into the lonely but highly imaginative life of a young woman, whose random and conscious acts of kindness changes the destiny of those around her. ~Amelie~ shows us that even little things can cause people to fall in love again, alter their views of themselves and make life worth living.Amelie Powlain (Audrey Tautou) is a beautiful girl living in Paris, who waits tables at a local restaurant, and discovers that pleasure can be found in simple things: skimming stones across water, cracking the top of her Creme Brunee with a spoon, and ultimately taking a genuine interest in the lives of the people around her.The direction of Jeunet and the magical photography of Bruno Delbonnel, creates an otherworldly Paris, a Paris that Parisians knew existed but is now almost forgotten. There's no graffitti on the walls, the charming streets are rubbish free, and the soft hue of that special Parisian light, which is well known to some of us, is captured with subtle intensity. This is truly another world that we can only wish for.It is certain that viewers of this unusual and beguiling film will come away with the feeling that life is about simple pleasures, and kindness, random acts of kindness, can change the destiny of people around us in profound ways.~Amelie~ is nothing less than a five star experience.	5.0	How random kindness can change the world...	2002-08-24	9	8	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"If ever I needed a movie dubbed, this one would be it. Normally, I prefer subtitles, but the visuals in here are so incredible that trying to read the subtitles distracts me from taking in all there is to see. I wish we English-speaking people had that opiton.Man, there is a lot to see: brilliant, beautiful colors in scene-after-scene. They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is ""French,"" meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean.However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. The story is absurd, as most of the characters are, the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps make the tale palatable.There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the ""R"" rating, otherwise it would be an easy ""PG."" In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes."	4.0	Incredible French Feast For The Eyes (Dubbed Version Would Help, Too)	2006-04-30	4	3	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"Amelie is a waitress in a Montmarte cafe.  She is painfully shy, but has an impish sense of humour.  One day she finds a box hidden behind a baseboard in her apartment - full of little toys and pictures, obviously belonging to a little boy.  She tracks down the boy (now a 50-year-old man) and anonymously gives him the box.  His obvious joy at finding these childhood treasures, and his vow to look up his estranged daughter, inspire Amelie to embark on a life of do-gooding.  Thus, the life-affirming and very charming film Amelie is underway.The joy of Amelie lies not only in the story, but also how it effortlessly evokes a place (Paris's Montmartre district) and a feel.  The cimematographer artificially ramps up the colour to give a lush, bright, and cheerful film to match the quirky and charming events of the film.  Few films make such good use of location (it is revealed in the director's commentary, for example, that both the sex shop and grocery are within walking distance of the director's own apartment).  Sacre Coeur Cathedral is featured in one scene, but it is not emphasized - it's just part of the landscape.Doubtless some jokes are lost in translation, but even this subtitled version is full of funny jokes.  Few are laugh-out-loud Simpsons-esque jokes to be sure, but you're likely to have a smile on your face throughout.  Tatou is brilliant in her portrayal of the titular heroine, and the rest of the cast also rise to the occasion.  I especially like her relationship with the eccentric painter who lives in a nearby apartment.  In analyzing the Renoir he is copying, she and he also analyze her life, leading to some of the most moving moments in the film.Many reviewers call this a perfect romantic movie.  While I don't agree - the characters are all so quirky that it gets a little tiresome, and there is a rediculous ""misunderstanding"" that only serves to draw the conclusion of the film out for no good reason (and making the film 15 minutes too long).  But it is very good and fun for all adult ages and both genders (English viewers might be taken aback by the seemingly random and casual insertion of nudity/sex at certain points, but this is such a typically French attitude that, for me, it adds positively to the evocation of time and place).There are some nifty extras.  Of most interest is the technical featurette that details the location shooting and the cinematographer's work.  The director Jeunet is actually quite funny in English as well as French, and the Q&A; session at an American university is also quite fun (especially when he shoots down a questioner who makes the mistake of mentioning the French New Wave: ""New? That was 40 years ago!"")"	4.0	Enjoyable, fun, life-affirming, but not for kids!	2010-07-09	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2BT578J4IZOK6	"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua"""	"Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and starring Audrey Tatou in the title role, ""Amelie"" is set in the Montmartre area of Paris. The film focuses on Amelie, the only child of Raphael and Amandine Poulain. Her father is a neurotic ex-army doctor while her mother was a teacher with all the warmth of an iceberg. Withheld from school as a child, due to her father's mistaken belief that she had a heart defect, Amelie was educated at home - initially by her mother. Amandine died when Amelie was young, however, when she broke the fall of a suicidal Canadian jumping from the tower of Notre Dame Cathedral. Her lack of contact with other children meant her only friend was a goldfish called Blubber and led to the development of quite an active imagination.Even as an adult, Amelie amuses herself with silly questions without ever really becoming close to anyone. She regularly visits her father, Raphael - he would dearly love to travel, but is too afraid to take the first step. She works as a waitress in a caf&eacute; called Les Deux Moulins, a real caf&eacute; in Montmartre. Among her colleagues are Gina, who seems to be the closest thing to a friend Amelie has and Georgette, who runs the tabac. Georgette is quite possibly the definitive hypochondriac. One of the caf&eacute;'s regulars is a man called Joseph - a former lover of Gina, he is an incredibly jealous and possessive character who constantly spies on her.As the film progresses, she becomes friendly with an elderly neighbour. Commonly known as the Glass Man, his real name is Raymond Dufayel. He never leaves his apartment, and has an obsession of his own : Renoir's ""Luncheon of the Boating Party"". Dufayel has painted one of his own every year for the last twenty years, but he just can't get it right. One of the film's most likeable characters is Lucien, who works at the greengrocers and takes art lessons with Dufayel. Amelie, who is very fond of Lucien, doesn't really care for his boss - the obnoxious and abusive Monsieur Collignon.Amelie's life starts to change when she finds a small box of keepsakes hidden in the wall of her bathroom - toy cars and bikes, pictures of football players and such like. Based on the box's contents, she believes that the box was hidden there in the 50s by a young boy, and decides to reunite the box with its owner. Looking for information about who lived in her apartment at that time, she starts with Madeleine Wells. An emotional wreck, her husband ran off with his secretary to South America, and was killed in a car accident there. Nico Quincampoix, however, provides the biggest reason for change. Another loner, like Amelie, he collects photos left lying around the photo booths of the city's metro and train stations. For some reason, he keeps these in a photo album - which is found by Amelie after he drops it in the street. However, she finds she has fallen for him - but like her father, she seems afraid to take the first step.This is easily one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. Set in one of the world's most beautiful cities and featuring a collection of quirky and / or likeable characters, it's a film I just can't find fault with. It's filmed in French and subtitled, which might put some people off - for me, however, the subtitles actually seem to add to the film's enjoyment."	5.0	Amelie Poulain : The Cure to ALL of Life&#65533;s Ills	2004-04-26	9	5	4

I went into seeing this movie thinking it would be another style over substance foreign bore, but I was very happy at the end. This story was so sweet and charming, I don't remember any other film making me feel as good as this one did. It's hard to describe what was so good about it but I'll try. The story was enchanting, Audrey Tatou's portrayal of the shy Amelie was outstanding (by the end of the picture I was in love with her), and the film was visually impressing as well. This film might not be for everyone, but if you are the kind of person who likes interesting totally believable characters (or someone who pays attention to things like character development) and you have a heart this movie is sure to touch you.

I think the best way to describe this movie is quriky--each characters have thier own quirks and strange obsessions (very Roald Dahl-like to me).No, this movie does not encourage you to think deeply about the psycology of the characters or their situations, but that makes it a perfect, sit-back and enjoy it FUN movie that will have you grinning through the whole thing.Yes, parts are strange and at first its hard to see how some parts fit in, but each of the situations/subplots are humorous and are wonderful.Do not watch this movie expecting it to be some sort of earth-shattering deep Academy-Award winner, because then you will be so confused at first that you will certainly be dissappointed.  However, this movie is one of the greatest feel-good movies ever, and despite its strangeness at points, it just fits so well with the quirky, but wonderful characters.	4.0	Quirky, Unrealistic and FUN!	2006-04-26	4	3	1

I'm into romantic movies - I am a hopeless romantic, etc, but this movie didn't do a THING for me. The lead actress is cute, yes, and there are a few moderately cute bits here and there, but romantic? NO.It's certainly not the type of movie you feel OK about sitting down and watching with your parents (as I tried to do).SOme nasty lines my mother hated, (""he's like that because his father peed in his mother"").Yes, Amelie becomes a bit of a matchmaker in one storyline, but I don't think the result of the match (a man and a woman have sex in a toilet loud enough to make all the dishes jump on the shelves of the cafe) is romantic - at all.or Amelie sitting on the roof seeing how many orgasms she can hear (fifteen, as it turns out).In short, this movie didn't produce ANY feel-good emotion in me at all. If you're after something like Sleepless in Seattle, you're going to be very disappointed. Even the love-story in Spider-Man 2 (which I watched with my folks) was HEAPS more romantic than this rubbish.Is it romantic to meet up with a guy you were trying to meet through and whole film and have sex with him staright away basically without having said 2 words thoughout the film?

It's truly a feel-good story, and it definitely succeeds in being such.  I watch it over and over and am entertained every time.The DVD also actually has good features, something that can be surpirsingly lacking on some DVDs; I particularly enjoyed seeing the audition of Ms. Tautou, found the interviews to be decently informative, and (as an amateur photographer) was quite interested in the explanation of the brilliant colour schemes.Overall, I give the disc 4.5 stars.	4.0	Je l'aime!

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"Like the star of Chocolat, the title character of this magical comedy also wants to heal people inside.  But this particular healer is a daydreamer with an irresistible smile, a Louise Brooks bob hairstyle or an Audrey Hepburn-like bun when it's tied up, and will charm the pants off the iciest of souls.The only-child of a tight-lipped, hard-hearted doctor father and a neurotic schoolteacher mother, Amelie Poulaine grew up being too much unloved, with a not too happy childhood.  As a young lady, she becomes a waitress at the Two Windmills cafe, but other times spends her time in an imaginative world of dreams, not forming close ties with people, being terribly shy.One day, she is watching TV when Princess Diana's death is announced.  From then on, she decides to be a healer of sorts, whether it be uniting a man with childhood memories he left in a cubbyhole in the skirting board long time ago, trying to soothe the hearts of people, make people's lives better, or being an avenging angel.  The scene where she helps a blind man across the street and describes what's going on is simply magical.Amelie is also befriended by artist Raymond Dufayel, known as the Glass Man because of a disease that has given him very brittle bones.  They communicate indirectly through a painting he's working on, particularly a young girl that Dufayel's trying to figure out.Amelie meets Nino Quincompoix, a man who collects discarded, frequently torn ID card photos from a photo booth and puts the reconstructed pieces in an album.  Included in there many times is a stern bald man whose pictures are always torn up.  Amelie finds Nino's album and wonders who the bald man is.  This is a mystery included in the film.There's Colignon the grocer, an obnoxious middle-aged man who delights himself in disparaging his assistant Lucien, who's slow-witted but nice and sensitive.  Amelie feels sorry for Lucien and the scenes where she becomes his avenging angel at Colignon's expense are hilarious.  At one point she tells Colignon, ""You'll never be a vegetable.  Even artichokes have hearts.""  Ouch, but well deserved.Amelie's widowed father spends his life collecting garden statues to decorate his dead wife's shrine, instead of travelling around the world.  Amelie steals one of them, a bearded garden gnome complete with red pointed hat, and then something weird happens.  A few days later, her father receives a postcard from the gnome, who is apparently on holiday abroad!!!  This goes on for a while and completely baffles him.Audrey Tautou would've been my choice for Best Actress of the year.  I simply melted everytime she smiled in the movie.  She also bears a slight similarity to another Audrey--Hepburn.  Both have in common black hair, a face brimming with charm, and irresistible smiles.  Maybe that's why it was love at first sight with me.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet uses some quirky film techniques, mostly visual imagery, such as a scene when Amelie literally dissolves into water.  The onscreen narration is also useful.  At times, it sets the stage for turning points in the film.  Earlier, it describes the likes and hates of the Poulaines and the one important characteristic of the Two Windmill employees.  He creates an imaginative film that's a breather from the usual Hollywood grind.  But it's his closeups of Amelie and her smile that make this worth seeing over and over."	5.0	An irresistible smile of a film	2003-01-10	183	174	9

B0000640VO	Amelie	A27CFNHYZG6WS8	darragh o'donoghue	Before I urge you to rush out and revel in this romantic wisp of a movie, I must warn you that it is the kind of film that will make you either quake with bleary joy, or propel you out of the cinema with an ungovernable urge to smash things.  If the words 'sugar', 'naive' or 'cute' are not in your vocabulary; if the mere sight of a bobbed gamine making eyes at you across the screen doesn't make your heart flutter; if scenes where lamps discuss their owner's love life with her paintings, or a young girl screams to save her suicidal goldfish don't enchant you, than, in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan, don't go.If, however, you feel your spiritual home is in France, than 'Amelie' might just make you fall in love again.  it is for those who love Paris in sunshine or rain; who palpitate at the very thought of tree-lined Parisian streets and cafes; who have experienced haunting musical epiphanies at night in empty Metro stations; who have read Raymond Queneau novels; who rejoice in street markets, Renoir paintings, or the sight of horses running in the Tour de France.'Amelie' is a romantic comedy for those who prefer the chase to the clinch.  its heroine is almost a ghost, unloved and friendless as a child, who presides disembodied over strangers' lives, linking characters, punishing baddies and deciding destinies in ways that seem supernatural to them.  She can only observe others from a distance and act accordingly - her own life remains emotionally dead.  Of the various Queneau-like mysteries, red-herrings, non-sequiters and paper trails strewn throughout the film, the most pressing and emotionally charged is - will Amelie find love and rejoin the real world?The film is unashamedly nostalgic in its romantic vision of a vanished (never-was?) Paris, where musette is still played in sparse cafes, and funfairs and ghost trains become sites of erotic possibility.  The CGI effects are used not for inhuman spectacle, but to do rich justice to individuals' inner lives.  The idea of reworking the past; the comfort of myths, lies and delusions; the creation of one's own future - these are some of the film's themes, and they encompass characters, culture and place.  As such, the film has been condemned as reactionary.  It's probably sexist (although I identified with Amelie, rather than simply fancying her).It has reminded people of various reference points from the Oulipo writers to the early films of the French New Wave to Ally MacBeal.  its most recent counterpart might be 'Magnolia', from the opening narrtion with its comic chaos theory, and its narrative about disparate people trying to connect, to the godlike force that contrives to do so.  But it's much more treasurable than that.  i loved this film.  I loved the adorable Audrey Tautou, funny and smart, with huge melancholy eyes - a 21st century Audrey Hepburn.  I loved the way the film felt like a cinematic novel without being literary.  I loved the way the mystery plots took on emotional dimensions - the connection of clues to recover the past to restore happiness.  I loved the colours, especially those rich reds; the wistful accordian music; the love of vignettes, photographs, chance, fantasy, dreams...	5.0	Makes you feel all warm.	2001-10-17	344	313	31
B0000640VO	Amelie	A10U5D2T50JREX	Darrell Heath	"Normally I come away feeling guilty for having enjoyed a ""feel good"" type of film. Guilty for having allowed myself to be emotionally manipulated by its saccharine sweet charms and silly romanticism.Not so with Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Amelie""! A movie that easily trancends all the trappings of a ""feel good"" movie to that of absolute, pure, cinema magic. While plainly unapologetic in its romantic whimsy, ""Amelie"" earns its emotions honestly. It doesn't resort to shamelessly manipulative gimmicks; it earns them by virtue of the fact that it has presented its audience with a finely crafted film: intelligent script, wonderful characters and outstanding performances.And speaking of performances- Audrey Tautou as the titular Amelie is a wonder to behold. She is both beautiful and utterly charming. She kept reminding me of another famous Audrey- by the name of ""Hepburn"". I hope we see much more of Mademoiselle Tautou in future.In a world where movies are rarely both entertainig as well as true works of art ""Amelie"" exceeds all expectations. Jeunet has made some fabulous (yet dark) films in his career (ie. ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of Lost Children"") but ""Amelie"" is, for me at least, his most enjoyable film to date. Before you even think about watching ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle"" again, check out ""Amelie"". I guarantee you won't be disappointed."	5.0	Pure Cinema Magic!!	2002-01-24	2	1	1

The cinematography is unusual, with many extreme close-up with wide angle lenses, and with what looks like some artificially altered lighting colors.  But the light is part of the mood.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A18VP2TXOUW4ZN	David B. Isbell	This is the second of only two DVD's I have ever bought without really knowing anything about the film.  I have no idea how I ran across it on Amazon, but I decided to park on it for a while and read the reviews.  Each one promised 5 stars or 4 very stong stars in imagination, cinematography, plot, and character development.  I ran out and bought the disc as soon as I saw it appear on the shelves (it happened to be on sale), brought it home yesterday and watched it this morning.  I was thoroughly impressed and entertained!  This is a romantic comedy like no other I have ever seen.  The French certainly have a refreshing sense of humor.  There are a few objectionable scenes (they were fun), but this is really a PG film, all things considered.  You can gather plenty of information about Amelie by reading other reviews so I will not waste your time with it.  I will say that you will not be disappointed at all.  If you liked The Cutting Edge, Six Days [and] Seven Nights, Sleepless in Seattle, or other such films, then this one is sure to paste a huge smile on your face and hold it there for two straight hours.  Buy Amelie on DVD and be prepared to watch it again and again and again, while renewing a child-like belief that dreams really can come true.	5.0	A Cute Little Actress, A Cute Little Story	2002-07-25	1	1	0

While many feel that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet displays a light, joyful touch in this film, I felt that he was trying to cram his sense of whimsy down my throat and I couldn't help gagging on it.  When I feel that my life is lacking in cuteness, I have some pictures of kittens sitting in baskets that I can look at instead of spending a couple of hours with this film.But then, I don't like ""E.T."" either, so clearly I am out of step with what warms the cockles of most movie-goers' hearts.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1DJ7BDHNYQKA0	David Dignan	Jean-Pierre Jeunet's giant raspberry swoon of a picture is very much a film of and for fantasists - it's no surprise that our heroine, lonely waitress and professional do-gooder Amelie (Tautou), finds her belated match in a fellow lost soul (Kassovitz) working amidst the screams and shrieks of Montmartre's porno shops and ghost trains. In the film's fantasy sequences - where, amongst other effects, the waitress melts into a pool of cold water upon seeing her beloved - Jeunet demonstrates it's not too far from Amelie to Ally McBeal; but where the American lawyer always seems trapped by her own cuteness, determined to be winsome at all legal costs, Amelie's ever-spiralling gift for the imaginative proves something of a liberation as the film goes off in every direction, the camera charging through the heart of Paris and ending up in a district here given a real - if ethnically uncertain - sense of community, with all the fraught and tangled relationships that word implies.The film takes the sensual over the sensational, though, and is more interested in the world's life-giving petites morts than in death itself. This is a film of simple pleasures (sweets being made, hands being dipped into bags of grain, the smell of a lover's hair, a box of trinkets) which keeps the grand tragedy of Princess Diana's death in the French capital strictly as a backdrop. I was worried how this real-life event - with its treacly potential for sentimentality - might be filtered into the plot, but it turns out that Amelie is more interested in the pleasant sidebars than the press's wailing headlines, and more affected by the quiet, unseen tragedies happening to those we personally know than by those celebrity deaths trumpeted across the news - these latter, Jeunet argues, are the type we can do nothing about.There's still something in the plot about cameras and accidents. An early joke has Amelie take revenge on the neighbour who tells her her automatic flash was responsible for a minor car crash, which feeds into the film's best gag about the melancholic-looking man (Rufus) whose torn photos litter the floors of Photo-Me booths the whole Metro over. But this seems part of Amelie's discourse on art and life, how we can take others' personally-specific creations to our own hearts; at one point, the heroine watches a drab Russian military drama whose subtitles keep referring back to her own life. Certainly this is a movie about a woman who has to put some kind of distance between herself and her lover to maintain any kind of a relationship. This is a rather fun notion of romance as game-playing, and when our two star-crossed lovers finally kiss, it seems apt they make for predestined targets on the other's face, trying to sink one another's emotional Battleships. (In a film of such simple pleasures, Tautou and Kassovitz's sole love scene is suitably simple - and pleasurable.)Jeunet is here playing astute political games, delivering a feel-good movie which both assures the Right that there is still good in the world (even if it has to be brought about by exploited waitresses and sex shop workers) and suggests to the Left the need for more radical changes, like those brought about by Amelie, to improve a society. Tautou increases in charm and presence as the film goes on. With her stylish layered bob and big shoes, she first appears a little too girlish and model-like, as if she's just stomped off the Paris Fashion Week catwalk and out into the periphery. Eventually, though, the casting begins to make perfect sense, particularly in those scenes where the happy-maker's broken heart leaves her impossibly fragile: the noise you can hear in the cinema is that of an entire audience falling for one woman.	4.0	Giant raspberry swoon of a picture	2002-03-01	0	0	0

A few cinematic tricks (which we see every week on ""Ally McBeal"" and a sqeaky clean girl do not add up to a great movie. First, the character development is not strong at all ... We see reactions of people, but nothing more. As for the script, well, directors let Chuck Norris say more than this star. For the first half hour, I thought she was mute! And the story line? I could see this train wreck coming at the beginning. How sweet! Cute lonely girl helps others find happiness. Will she find love and happiness herself? Duh! ...! If you want to see a great film about how one person affects others, one that has great writing, acting, character development that is far above this ""Amelie"" tripe, then rent or buy ""Vagabond,"" a film by Agnes Varda starring Sandrine Bonnaire. I guarantee you, put these two chicks in the same room and the Vag girl will stomp all the cuteness outa that imp in two seconds! And don't worry, ""Vagabond"" has subtitles too! Hurray! Grow up!

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1RRIBUALAUMKS	Deanna Fogg	"The opening of this movie was a little bizzar, but it certainly got my attention. The characters in the movie are introduced by the narrator, who includes the odd things they do for a simple perk (ie: Amelie likes to dip her hand into a sack of beans at the market). Plus, I've never actually seen (or wanted to see) a baby popping out of its mother. That was a little bit of a shock.As I'm sure you've heard, Amelie is about a waitress that makes it her duty to help people without their knowledge. She's very introverted, which started because her father, a doctor, believed she had a heart problem and kept her home-schooled. Instead of meeting and talking to people, she kind of observes them from the background when she can.The first good deed she did was an accident. She discovers a box hidden behind a lose tile in her bathroom, and feels the need to return it, which begins the search for its owner. This leads to another thing, and another, and Amelie begins to get ideas and inspirations from everything around her. Her daydreams tend to be funny and oddly real (as in, the part most Americans keep tucked away for fear it will make them look idiotic), and her imagination is great.The settings and acting in this were fabulous as far as I understood, and the story was the type that leaves you oddly happy. When it was over, the only thing I was able to do was gush out, ""Wow,"" to nobody in particular."	5.0	Creatively Charming	2003-04-05	3	3	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	This quirky film won me over from its first moments showing the childhood of Amelie, an imaginative girl born of emotionally stunted parents. From her suicidal goldfish to her belief that her camera causes accidents to her sullen (and hilarious) revenge against her father, Amelie's childhood perfectly describes the rest of the film: both poignantly real and humorously surreal. As an adult, Amelie (Audrey Tautou) retains her impish nature while living in a circumscribed world. She works as a waitress in a caf&eacute;, lives alone in her Parisian flat, and spies on her neighbors. When she discovers by accident a small box hidden behind the tile of her bathroom, Amelie sets out to return it to its rightful owner. Because of the effect this return has, Amelie sets out to do good deeds aimed to change the lives of other people, ignoring the reality that her own life is desperately in need of love.The plot by itself cannot adequately define this film. The wry voiceovers create a tone of humorous levity, and the cast of off-beat characters lend the feel of a small circus. Warmth and charm and wit abound. The remarkable performance of Audrey Tautou - honest and nuanced - brings the entire film into focus.I waited far too long to see this film. I highly recommend it for a wide audience, from foreign film buffs to romantic comedy devotees to those looking for a funny, upbeat film to liven up the evening.	5.0	Charming, clever - a delight!	2003-04-06	11	9	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"This is a delightful romantic fantasy of love and comedy, of vivid color and some preposterous antics of love and friendship that will send mawkish tears down your cheeks while making you laugh out loud. If not, turn in your headset for a heart.Audrey Tautou is Amelie, a fashion-sharp Parisian waitress with an impish heart of gold and an shyness born of a bizarrely restricted childhood.  She is cute and innocent, but not too innocent.Her father, who was a physician, thought she had a defective heart because every time he put the stethoscope to her little chest it was beating wildly.  A voice-over explains that this was caused by the excitement that Amelie felt because her frigid father, whom she wanted so much to hold her, although he never did, was actually touching her.  Because of an imagined heart condition she is kept out of school and tutored at home.After her mother dies from being hit by a falling body (an actual human body on its way to the pavement from a tall building) we are flash-forwarded to the present where we find little Amelie all grown up.  She still has no love in her life.  But one day while listening to a news report of the death of Princess Di she drops something on the floor of her apartment.  It rolls against a tile in the bathroom, dislodging the tile.  Amelie pulls down the tile and finds in a hole in the wall a little tin box full of a boy's childhood mementoes from many years ago.  In a characteristic bit of inspiration she decides to find that little boy, now grown into middle age, and give him the box.  But she is shy and so must invent a stratagem.  She arranges to call him when he is near a public phone booth in which she has placed the box.  So delighted with the joy she has given him, Amelie sets off on a series of inventive and pixie-like intrusions into the lives of others in order to bring them happiness and even love.While this R-rated fantasy would delight children there is too much actual sex in it for most American moms to tolerate for their little ones.  In fact in the French style sex is made innocent, and of course that will not set well with those of a prudish nature.Favorite corny pun: ""Even artichokes have hearts.""  Favorite elaborate joke: sending her father's garden gnome on the world tour that he won't take himself, and having the gnome photographed at tourist sites and the photos sent airmail to a very perplexed dad. Favorite joke: the beggar refusing a handout saying he takes Sundays off.  Favorite scheme: reconstructing through cut and paste and photocopy the words of the landlady's beloved, and then fashioning a last love letter to her from him that was lost in the mail for forty years.The two disc set includes a wealth of information to delight afficionados.  There's an interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, some footage on how Amelie was made, filmographies of cast and crew, audition footage, etc., etc.Bottom line: very funny, heart-warming and strikingly original."	5.0	Funny, heart-warming and strikingly original	2004-02-11	10	8	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A32XYIHALF32K7	Dereck Cram	&quot;On Sept. 3, 1973 a blue fly capable of flapping 70 beats a minute landed on St. Vincent Street in Montmartre...&quot;I have been a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet since &quot;Delicatessen&quot;, but when I first received wind of &quot;Amelie&quot; I had no idea that it was Jeunet's work until I finally rented it.  &quot;Amelie&quot; is by far his greatest, most beautiful, and least fantastic masterpiece.  Wrought with his trademark vivid green, red, and blue shades of film color, the movie flows along a nostalgic dreamland in a would-be (or could-be) Paris.  Chance. Fate.  Ah Amour!  It was chance that Jeunet even found the script for this movie (you will find this out from one of the fantastic extras on this DVD).  The enchanting Audrey Tautou was not the original choice for lead actress and had to go through a screen test, but without her would there exist an Amelie at all?!Whether or not you enjoy romance, a good mystery, or just good movies you will thoroughly enjoy this one.This is an excellent movie...if you don't mind subtitles (for all of us non-French speakers)!Even now after four viewings I can't help but wonder if the gnome will travel again--where will he travel to next?!	5.0	The Mark of Zorro	2003-02-18	4	3	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2N79TQPXUB0T8	derelick	This was one of the sweetest, most whimsical movies I've seen in a long time! Audrey Tautou (The Venus Beauty Institue) is absolutely beguiling as Amelie, an extremely shy and eccentric young woman. When Amelie sees the delight she brings to a man after she anonymously returns his long-lost box of childhood treasures, she devotes her life to helping others find this same joy. While Amelie is doing all of these good deeds, she discovers a young man as charmingly eccentric as she is, but can she find the courage to bring herself the same happiness she has brought to so many others?	5.0	This movie does for good deeds what Chocolat did for candy..	2003-02-08	1	1	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8	Desmond Chan	I am not be a pundit in the appreciation of French movie but AMELIE clearly deserves the accolades it garners - and what a triumph for director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who returns to his motherland after dabbling in a Hollywood feature Alien Resurrection. Jeunet uses masterly beautiful cinematography and digital effects to enhance the poetic Paris where Amelie, played by the enchanting ingenue Audrey Tautou desires to spread bliss to the surrounding people and performs the deed anonymously.The movie starts with the purveying of Amelie's childhood where her father is a physician who yearns to travel. The intimacy towards her reticent father is only experienced when he gives her a check-up; her mother died tragically with a fateful suicidal victim falling onto her. Introverted and a lonely recluse, she enjoys the small pleasures of throwing stones in the river and eating strawberries from her fingers. She slowly fades into the glorious Paris where few ever stops to admire its delicate beauty. It is only until the day when she finds unexpectedly a box with little toys and returns it to the owner after much difficulty that she discovers the simple joy of spreading warmth to the people around in her tiny universe.AMELIE is heavenly for the subtle emotions it triggers. The quirky humour where Lady Di's sensational demise is juxtaposed wickedly to Mother Teresa's; Amelie's sarcasm towards the grumbling grocery shop-owner -&quot;even artichokes have a heart&quot;. It is ironic that she lacks the courage to pursue her own happiness when she gives others mirth through little acts. She steals her father's gnome and pictures it with thw world's historical monuments as backgrounds to convince her father to venture out; she writes love letter to comfort the forlorn widow; she gives the Glass Man who named for his brittle bones a new perspective towards life. In her adventures there is sweet exuberance and fluttering hope that she finds her true love with a shy photographer (Mathieu Kassovitz).Of course the dazzlingly resplendent magical Paris isn't reality - and curmudegeons in the Cannes Festival rejected the film for its lack of realism. Yet in this film Jeunet's deliberate removal of flaws through computer effects has wondrously touched the audience's heart to spellbinding effect. It sheds miraculously hope in the worst of times and that ordinary heroes can achieve happiness unwittingly. The lead role intended for Emily Watson is through a twist of fate, helmed by Audrey Tautou - and through her emotive eyes - there are genuine moments of sorrow, mellifluous joy, cunning and bashfulness.For all its box-office phenomenon, it remains at the very best a deeply moving picture that will tug at your heartstring for a very long time after you leave the cinema. Happiness is a subliminal experience - and it is definitely one emotion you will feel after this movie.	5.0	AMELIE regales with small wonders of joy and happiness	2002-01-05	5	3	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3I0E8XUPQUQ5E	D. G. Pratt	"I'm going to assume that anyone looking at this listing is familiar with the movie Am&eacute;lie and will stick to technical details of this release.  If you want thoughts about the movie, I suggest taking a look at the  980+ reviews of the DVD:Am&eacute;lieSuffice to say that this is a ""top 5"" favorite movie for me, since I first saw it in a theater, or I wouldn't have bothered importing it on Blu-ray Disc.This Blu-ray Disc was released by Icon in Australia.  It comes in a blue Amaray case that is the same height as a regular BD case but is the same thickness as a standard DVD case.The main menu and movie are in Region A, B, C (""region-free"") High Definition and will play on any Blu-ray Disc player.  The leading trailers and extras are in standard definition PAL format and will not play correctly on most USA/Canada BD players, except for region-free ones (such as Momitsu, or equivalent).The disc opens with some copyright screens in high definition (I thought the ""don't burn"" one was nicely done).  These are followed by some PAL trailers that are not watchable on NTSC BD players.  The main menu button doesn't work but the trailers can easily be skipped by using the ""chapter skip"" button on the player remote.  That brings you to the main menu, in high definition.  The main menu doesn't have a ""setup"" tab.  Instead, when the movie is played, the disc defaults to the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track with English subtitles ""on"" (they can be turned off if you wish).  Very convenient.  (For those folks with front projectors, please note that the subtitles are ""Sony-style"" and have the top line in the 2.35:1 image and the lower line below the picture.  This can be a problem for those using 2.35:1 masked screens.)I thought the movie was lovely in high definition; I couldn't ask for a better presentation.  Perhaps someone with a higher end system can find flaws to criticize but for me, this is what I was hoping for with this purchase.  Best of all, this release has the correct English subtitles!  The Disney/Miramax DVD release had numerous subtitle errors, some of which changed the meaning of the dialog and led to confusion.  Having the correct subtitles is a big plus for me and was the other thing I was hoping for in this release, in addition to a good high def picture.To sum up: this release of Am&eacute;lie is gorgeous in high definition and has the correct subtiles.  But the extras aren't viewable on most USA/Canada BD players.  Since I've already seen the extras on the DVD, I'm happy to have the movie in high def at last.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I'm giving this BD four stars because the extras and leading trailers can't be viewed on NTSC BD players (they could have converted them to HD).  But the movie itself is five stars all the way!"	4.0	Am&eacute;lie in High Definition, at last!	2009-12-01	20	19	1

She manages to orchestrate several feel good solutions for the lives of her friends and family.  And, then she falls in love but can't bring her introverted self to let him know how she feels.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3LA8WLE0RQ4MB	"D. Movahedpour ""doeadear"""	This is a visually stunning and utterly charming film about love and loss and loneliness, and missed (and near-missed) opportunities. Audrey Tatou carries this film on her tiny shoulders, with a great supporting cast to help her. She is perfectly cast as Amelie, the shy, lovelorn title character who works as a waitress in a cafe and, through a series of twists of fate, decides to involve herself in changing the lives of those around her. And, in the end, changing her own life.Fate causes Amelie to discover a cache of long-forgotten toys, hidden in a corner of her apartment, left there by a small boy who is now an old man. This leads to the machinations of everyone's lives, from the nasty green-grocer and his sweet, simple-minded assistant, to the disabled, all-knowing man across the courtyard, to the broken-hearted concierge whose husband left her decades before, to co-workers and even her own father. But, Amelie discovers her own heart beating for the love she craves, and while guiding the lives of others, she almost forgets about her own life.Everything about this film is beautiful, from the cinematography, to the direction, writing, art direction and, of course, the acting. Montmartre is practically a co-star in this beautiful film.

I am reminded of Audrey Hepburn in the fifties and Louise Brooks in the twenties. It proves that often, nothing changes!""Amelie"" is an enchanting piece of porcelain which relies almost completely on the gamin charms and range of expressions of its star Audrey Tatou. Tatou does not give an acting performance in the conventional sense, but the director Jean Pierre Jeunet subjects her to endless closeups smiling at the camera and the story relies on her  ability to seduce us into her fantasy world. Fortunately, she succeeds. While at times the complicated web of stories become convoluted and overlong, an invaluable and droll commentary keeps things in check. For 2 hours we are transported into Amelie's world. There are endless visual tricks along the way, some enchanting, others pretentious but this is the ultimate feel good film and all plot points, however hard to follow, are neatly tied up.The copy I have watched was a special edition with some good extras including a commentary from the director in heavily accented English, an interview with him and a few members of the cast who barely get a word and some cute bits like auditions and a series of stills, behind the scenes and otherwise.The Special Edition DVD package is OK value."	4.0	Gamin de Paris - Audrey Hepburn re-incarnated	2008-06-21	2	2	0

There have been many films (foreign and non) made about misfits who live their lives outside of the box, but few have been orchestrated with such whimsy, subtlety and warmth as was done with ""Amelie.""Amelie (Audrey Tatou) is a young waitress at a cafe, who lives a solitary existence in Paris, and we get a sense from the very beginning that she has spent her life on the outside looking in.  She has a lively and individualistic imagination.  A chance discovery of a mysterious childhood toy box and her determination to return it to the original owner, inspires her to make bringing joy and redemption to others her life's work.  It isn't until she comes face-to-face with a potential suitor (Nino--played by Mathieu Kassovitz) that the shy waif must look to find her own true bliss.One of the strogest qualities of this film is the magical and intriguing combination of magical realism (talking pictures of animals, the juxtaposition of Amelie's fantasies and how she applies them to reality) and warm sprinkles of exhuberant humor.  This is also a film with a great heart.  It is truly a shining example of an adult fairy tale where destiny can be determined by timing and courage.

The colors that are chosen are very beautiful, it seems as if everything has a greenish tint which is really interesting.  The music in this movie is incredibly beautiful, and is quite possibly the best soundtrack ever made.  The movie itself is just plain fun!  I usually despise romantic comedies, but if thats what you want to call this movie (it really bridges the gap between genres but..), this is an exception.  The first 10 minutes are just brief character synopsis, and you will find how quirky and fun this movie is right from the start (the suicidal fish!  I love it!)  I'd have to say the BEST part of this movie, though, is the garden gnome!  The DVD also has the original language track in Parisian French which is interesting to listen to.  Such an amazing movie!

B0000640VO	Amelie	A26RBY3J2NAHV0	dveej	"Amelie, or Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain as the movie is known in French, is firmly in the tradition of French romantic comedy films. This genre of film has a particular sensibility which can seem cutesy or cloyingly sweet and unquestioning; yet films in this genre often have little surprises which remind the viewer that this is after all a French film, and not subject to the rules of cutesy films in English.It's a very well made film, with beautiful cinematography, REALLY excellent acting by great French film actors, and above all many, many long takes shot in some of the most characteristic neighborhoods and around some of the most famous public buildings in Paris. This film is a love song to Paris. You could turn the sound off and just watch it with no subtitles, and you would both understand the plot and be moved by the plot and the beauty of the visuals.But by snooty intellectual standards, it's a bit sentimental, although with liberal doses of wit and bite. It's not a challenging film which questions darkly the basic foundations of society or anything like that. Several times in the course of the film a character turns and impishly addresses the camera, which will give you an idea of the somwehat juvenile sensibility. And this is appropriate, because after all it is about a woman who has not yet quite grown up.There was a controversy about the film: people objected that Amelie, who is a waitress at a cafe/bar, lives in Paris: that would never happen in real life, because she couldn't afford it. And the neighborhood in which most of the action takes place is populated largely by immigrants from Africa -- yet only one character in the whole film is played by an actor of North African descent. It's a lily-white, golden- and sepia-toned dreamy look at what many French people no doubt wish France was like: it harkens back to a mythical golden France-that-never-was, where, as Nancy Reagan once let slip over a public microphone, there are ""all these lovely white people"".So it's sappy and a little silly, but in a witty and unexpected way, and it's beautiful. And the message is kind of a good one, on balance: Amelie cares a lot about others but needs at some point to start living her own life.The acting is top-notch, and even the accents of the characters are carefully placed and perfectly complement the emotional architecture of the film. There are some witty digressions in quick montage form of ""what might have happened"", a la the movie Run, Lola, Run, which are quite funny. Much of this film is funny.So if you like French stuff, and don't mind a bit of schmaltz with some hot pepper popping up here and there, this movie is for you. I give it a five for visuals, a five for acting, a three for plot, a four for the dynamics of interpersonal relations and the questions explored around them, and a one for the studied avoidance of any social questions like immigration or how people who work for a living in Paris really live.I quite enjoyed it."	3.0	An idealized view of France the way Le Pen would like it to be--but worth a look nonetheless	2005-07-21	11	3	8

For instance I cannot stand &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; and have almost no patience for &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; but I can watch this without gagging.This is a French movie with subtitles so those of you with aversions to the French and/or subtitles should skip this one.Amelie is a young French waitress who tries to secretly improve the lives of others (through all kinds of kooky schemes), but her own love life is nonexistent.  Until she encounters a young man with a strange obsession for collecting discarded photos from photo booths.Overall this is a very nice movie; however Amelie struck me as a little too &quot;stalkerly&quot; in her machinations to help other people.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Don't read reviews of the French film ""Amelie"" in advance, because the impression you'll get before you see it is: This is ""Emma"" on acid. And it isn't -- it's a sweet, whimsical, weird, and touching little tale about a shy young woman with a big heart. She's nobody's little weasel... yet! But as the movie progresses, you'll rapidly want to see her become somebody's little weasel.Amelie (Audrey Tatou) is a shy, introspective young woman with a vivid imagination and a quirky sense of humor. One day she accidently finds a little box of toys and photographs, and goes on a little quest to find the owner, decades later, and give him back his box. When the return of the box improves the man's life, Amelie is so pleased that she decides to keep helping others be happy in their own lives.She gives a brittle-boned, reclusive old artist videos of pleasant things. She booby-traps a nasty grocer's apartment because of the way he treats a sweet, slow young man preoccupied by the late Princess Di. She directs a jealous man to a hypochondriac tobacconist in the hopes of making them both happy, sends her lonely father's garden gnome around the world (her father is still grieving for Amelie's mother, who was killed by a suicidal Canadian tourist leaping off a cathedral), and her landlady who still grieves for her late, unfaithful husband. But then Amelie encounters a dreamy young man, Nino, and finds a collection of photographs that he has collected. Will Amelie be able to do for herself what she has done for others -- and fall in love?It certainly says something about ""Amelie"" that all the copies were virtually unavailable in my area for the longest time. It's a very sweet, cute, romantic film with a lot of nice visual tricks and likeable characters. If you don't like movies where people can fall in love at first sight, paintings talk, goldfish commit suicide and statues wink, then you won't like this -- one of the best moments is when a quartet of photographs tell Nino that he has fallen in love with Amelie ""in your dreams."" (It takes a lot to make me melt, but that did it) And it's very rare that in movies, people do nice things just for the sake of it. One of my favorite scenes is Amelie guiding a blind man down the street, rapidly describing the things around them.And the little visual tricks, while they aren't totally necessary, are a nice touch to the movie -- Amelie being so unhappy that she turns into a puddle of water, her heart speeding up as she makes eye contact with Nino, and watching news reports about her life on the TV. Romantic moments abound -- a scene where Amelie and Nino hesitantly kiss parts of each other's faces is exquisite. And it's funny too, from the suicidal goldfish to the travelling garden gnome to the grocer's booby-trapped apartment, especially the speed dial that calls a psychiatric ward.Audrey Tatou is wonderful as Amelie, managing to be mischievous and innocent, sweet and sad. Matthieu Kassovitz is vastly underrated as Nino Quincampoix, a dreamy young man who works at an adult video store with a gyrating stripper (yes, it's an odd place for Amelie's soulmate to work, but just watch!). Serge Merlin is good as the likeable, gruff, grumpy Dufayel, Rufus is poignant as Amelie's withdrawn dad, and all the supporting actors weave together in a complex plot that centers on... Amelie.Like Amelie herself, ""Amelie"" is sweet and cute and funny and likeable, quirky and romantic. If you have even an ounce of romance in your soul, then sit back and visit ""Amelie"" in Paris in the springtime."	5.0	Paris in the springtime	2003-03-17	17	16	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	AC1K4OQOZ90RS	"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10"""	"This delightful French confection, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and co-written by Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant, is the story of Am&eacute;lie Poulain, the product of a hilariously dysfunctional marriage.  Her father is an obsessive-compulsive doctor and her mother is a nervous and twitchy schoolteacher.  As a result, Am&eacute;lie grows up isolated from her peers, and has a strong tendency to fantasize.  When she finally leaves home, she takes a job as a waitress and settles in Montmarte, in northern Paris.  There, she meets a host of eccentric characters whose lives become intertwined with hers in fascinating ways.This film is original, irresistibly charming, beautifully photographed, and laugh-out-loud funny.  Jeunet's cast is marvelous, and Audrey Tautou is perfect in the title role.  Her waif-like, large-eyed stare takes in everything and everyone around her, but she always remains on the fringes of life.  One evening, she finds a buried treasure that a little boy hid in her apartment forty years earlier.  She suddenly makes a life-altering decision to help others anonymously.  Am&eacute;lie subsequently gets involved with an aged shut-in, a mean-spirited greengrocer, a lonely woman abandoned by her philandering husband, and a young man with an extremely strange hobby.  She even tries her hand at bringing together an uproariously quirky couple.Jeunet fills the screen with unexpected sight-gags that, along with the droll dialogue, amuse us as we shake our heads, wondering how the screenwriters came up with this unusual story.  Yet for all its eccentricity, ""Am&eacute;lie"" explores universal and timeless themes. The lonely and the misunderstood among us need and deserve our compassion; without love, a human being withers away; and in our harsh, dog-eat-dog world ""times are hard for dreamers."""	5.0	"""An urge to help mankind comes over her."""	2009-02-22	1	1	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1HO42MXKLS16C	"""eden118"""	I've been reading some reviews for this film and I really don't care for how unrealistic this film is said to be.  Yes...life is not like the movies, but can we not have the movies take our mundane lives and artistically manipulate it into something more?  One French reviewer said that it did not portray Paris in the way it was at all.  I don't think that really was the point of the movie, nor to portray the most intelligent protagonist.  Amelie is a simple girl.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The world consists of more than just intellectuals.  We already know what the world is like...what reality puts forth.  Why would we have to sit through a movie that shows all of that if we can just step outside our door?  I believe that movies are a form of escape...artistic expression...a way to give form to our dreams.  I don't believe we should make all our movies with our heads in the clouds, but it's good that once in awhile, someone can create something not out of pragmatism but just pure, simple human emotion and fantasy.  The movie was not meant to be a documentary.  Everyone nowadays flocks to the blockbuster hits...action films...films with provocative actresses and promiscuity...or even the downright hardcore films that portray reality right down to its extreme complexities (Requiem For a Dream, FIght Club, which i do like).  It's a nice change to watch a simple film that focuses on artistic imagery and musical score rather than fast paced plot and sexually, superficially stimulating fidgeting with bad actors.  I feel that this movie shows how we forget about the simple things we all can afford in life...how we forget how refreshing and liberating those simple things can be.	5.0	Who Cares if the Film doesn't Portray Reality	2002-11-02	21	19	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2TV6SBCWT7P8S	ehakus	Amelie was one of the best films I have seen this year. I absolutely loved it! Certain films have the ability to give you a fresh perspective - they can change the way you look at things - and Amelie is one of those films. And rarer still, Amelie combines this ability with some really hilarious moments and some equally touching scenes!More specifically, my favorite thing about Amelie is its originality and creativity. It had a unique style that really allowed the viewer to get into the heads and hearts of the characters. This is probably due in part to the sarcastic, funny, and clever script and the remarkably effective voice over narration (which really sets the tone for the movie). Also, Amelie's originality and freshness is due to the interesting directing style.Essentially, Amelie is about a young French waitress (Audrey Tautou) who decides to help people fix up their lives. In her haste to help others, however,... This plot summary really doesn't convey the charming quality of the movie...but believe me it was wonderful!The acting was also great, and Audrey Tautou really reminded me of the other Audrey, the great Audrey Hepburn. They share the same shy glances, pretty faces, and delicate charm. In fact, in one scene in particular (when Amelie goes to meet Nino at the merry-go-round), I was sure that the director was poking fun at a classic Audrey Hepburn movie, Charade (where Audrey and Cary Grant meet in front of a merry-go-round), by dressing Amelie up in Audrey Hepburn style clothing. Did anyone else notice this?Anyhow, I don't know how else to recommend this movie. It made my day! In one word: WONDERFUL!	5.0	Charming, fresh and original...	2002-07-19	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2D5EEQDFPIBAI	Ellen Hastings	Am&eacute;lie is a frenetic bore that insists on its audience's adoration while making no demands upon their intelligence. The story is simplicity itself: Am&eacute;lie (Audrey Tautou), a waitress, lives in a strangely depopulated, deracinated Montmartre and longs for love. A waif with bobbed hair and pooling eyes, Am&eacute;lie looks like a silent-movie heroine, and for two tiring hours exercises an emotional range redolent of those primitive early entertainments -- she smiles at the camera, widens her eyes, crinkles her mouth. Because the film's director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is more of a watchmaker than a poet of the heart and soul, however, there is no mystery to how she finds love, only a series of intricately choreographed, Rube Goldberg-like set pieces in which Am&eacute;lie flips the switch. This is too bad not only because Tautou can actually act (she's charming when she's not twinkling as she goes in for the kill), but because she was Jeunet's best chance to take the chill off his film, to modulate his relentless technical virtuosity with the pulse of real life.	1.0	Leaden whimsy	2008-05-04	59	15	44

I thought a good place to start was with ""Amelie"". Audrey Tatou plays a young woman named Amelie who grows up as an isolated young girl. As an adult, Amelie works in a local cafe as a waitress. On the night that the Princess of Wales was killed in a car accident, Amelie stumbles upon a hidden box of toys from 40 years ago hidden behind the wall of her bathroom. Right then and there, Amelie decides to find the owner of the box and return it to him, hoping that it would bring him some happiness. What happens next that this inspires Amelie to try to do the same thing to other strangers, by various questionable methods.Amelie's approach to try to spread some happiness to other people may be questionable through lying and breaking and entering into people's homes but her intentions are good. In the long run, Amelie not also affects the lives of the people around her but herself as well. In my opinion ""Amelie"" was about the celebration of life.

If you have not seen it, you're more likely to rent it for three bucks than buy it. Yes?So, here is a review of the *DVD*. It is not good. In the commentary by the director, he even admits that he pushed the color too far to green and said he was not sure it worked. It is annoyingly green. There are things that are green that should not be green. If you have ever been to Paris, you know that the walls of the Metro are beige and not green.The movie is adorable. Tatou is adorable. The characters are cute and quirky. The added footage, interviews and commentary are very good. The director's chatter over the film is very French, &quot;Zees is my favorite scene....well, zees is my favorite scene...no, really zees is my absolute favorite scene, more zan zee others!&quot; The techical info is great. The peek into the ordered mind of the director is very edifying (if you want a director, hire this guy. He doesn't waste film.

I own the DVD and have seen it several times, and each time it fills me with a kind of wonder. It is the kind of timeless and pure story that made Hollywood great, but that Hollywood doesn't make any more.Aside from a handful of cynics, I can't imagine anyone who won't enjoy Amelie. But here's a test: if you, like the films main character, can take joy from life's simple pleasures (like the way your hand feels sinking into a sack of dried beans, the way street markets sound and smell, the absurdity of a horse running with the Tour de France), then this is a simple pleasure you don't want to miss.As far as the quality and value of this film, I can't add much to the hundreds of reviews already posted here except to say ""Yes! Yes! Me too!""An interesting side note: the more I watch the film, the more little cultural references and word plays I catch. I'm sure the film is full of them, but I think it would take a native French speaker or long-time Paris resident to catch them all (understanding them is not necessary to enjoy the film; they're a bonus).One I caught on the most recent viewing on TV (my French is sketchy, but seeing it with Italian subtitles rather than the English helped) is a play on words by Hippolito, the failed writer in the cafe, who comments that the cafe's regulars speak about the weather out of fear of the passing time. In French, ""temps"" means both ""time"" and ""weather.""Similarly, the grocer Collignon tells Amelie to contact his mother to discover the name of her apartment's former tennent. He says, ""Elle a une memoire d'elephant, un elephant de mer."" That translates to ""She has a memory like an elephant, a sea elephant"" -- a reference to a manatee or an seal. But the point is the way Collignon stresses ""mer"" (which means ""ocean""), which sounds the same as ""mere"" (which means ""mother"").I also noticed that the voice over used when Amelie imagines the television retrospective of her life is from the same person who does the television commentary for the funerals of France's rich, famous, and powerful. I peaked at the credits and found that he is Frederic Mitterrand, the nephew of the late prime minister.The last might be a stretch, but on my last trip to Paris I noticed a old-time chocolate brand called ""Poulain"", which is Amelie's family name.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A84UFSF2SZS2W	"EriKa ""E"""	"For many people, Audrey Tautou IS Amelie and therefore cannot ever be or play another role. I am not one of those people. Amelie did not ""infect"" or delight me the same way it seemed to infect and delight the masses, although it was certainly a whimsical, imaginative film with enough visual stimuli to entertain and mesmerize a person through several viewings. And yes, Audrey Tautou's performance was what one might call ""career making"" (but also served as a kind of ""brand"" in that it is hard for people to see her otherwise). At times hilarious, at other times more tender, the story revolves around Amelie, a shy, quiet, nave waitress in Paris who ""connives"" behind the scenes, doing small things that mean something much larger to others. Amelie delights in the little details of life and lives on dreams. She conspires to inspire others, returning lost objects to their owners, befriending people who have no friends, ""punishing"" those who are mean or unjust, helping others to fall in love. Hers is, perhaps, the invisible hand making game pieces move across a board, and Amelie derives joy from seeing the reactions. However, she knows her own life in incomplete and sets out to find her path and possibly her own love... this is done in an original and ""cute"" way. It is not quite ""overboard"" (as in saccharine/sickeningly sweet), but it is not... Neil Labute either. In any case, this is a delightful film, lighthearted and beautifully shot, so it is worth watching to see what everyone has been talking about."	3.0	beauty	2005-03-27	5	2	3

All their likes, dislikes and routines exposed, opening our eyes to our own quirky eccentricity.She decides to stir things up a bit with a &quot;loventure&quot; where she plays an exciting and mysterious voyeur game throughout the city with one man she recognizes from her past.Taking an unusual vigilante approach to a wrongdoer in her neighborhood, we're thrown into humorous scenes of confusion as he thinks he's going simply mad.Great reflection is shared with a fragile neighbor and she is able to grow and blossom thanks to his bending an ear.  His reward comes in glimpses of an unknown world.With splashes of personification, inanimate objects add to this splendid flick with their opinions and wonder.A must see.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1241U6QCSX5YJ	Erren Geraud Kelly	emma is reborn for the 21st century and her name is amelie.director jean-pierre-jeunet does a variation on the classic jane austen character and recreates a marvel for the ages. amelie's life story is like a cartoon, and yet the cartoon is a believeable as real life. nothing happens quite the way you expect and the result is in the name of goodness. she is not gorgeous, but she is cute; her face is unforgettable; she is the patron saint of the outcasts, wonderfully left of center.i'll try to explain this movie, but it will be an injustice. amelie appears to help those who need it: she finds a small box of toys under the sink in her bathroom, the night princess di dies. they belonged to a former tenant from 40 years ago. amelie gets the toys to the owner without being discovered. and when the man finds the box, he is in tears and reevaluates what's important in his life. amelie then goes on to play matchmaker for two jaded hearts who hang out at the resteraunt where she works as a waitress, and she becomes an avenging angel,  fighting for a dim bulb employee at a vegetable stand who is constantly taunted by his boss. i'll just say she finds subtle ways to drive him mad.amelie becomes all things to all people, but she is shy and introverted; she then meets a man, nino, who changes her life...the &quot; laughter &quot; ratio in this movie is 5:1. that means i was laughing every five minutes. it is laugh out loud funny. it is also full of romance and passion. every character is memorable. the people in the two windmills resteraunt, remind me of the characters from the ice man cometh, only sober. the cinematography and the special effects are boffo. it's like living in another world for two hours. the term &quot; life affirming &quot; gets thrown around alot when it comes to movies like this, but this film deserves it. Audrey Tautou ( as amelie ) will undoubted be compared to another audrey ( hepburn ), for her pixieesque presence. but ms. tautou puts a stamp on the movie that is hers alone. fall in love with amelie	5.0	Fall In Love With Amelie....	2001-11-13	24	21	3
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1JCN10T0TPOPH	"Esn024 ""esn024"""	"It's most likely just personal taste, but I wasn't blown away by this movie as much as most of the other people here seem to be. It was a valiant attempt, sure, for a director who'd only made dark films before to try to film a light comedy. Somehow, it didn't quite click with me. I judge this film a good effort, but I think that it missed its potential too often.I'll start with the first problem: The narrator. The narrator is present throughout the film, basically describing the story at every step; whenever a new character comes into the film, the narrator describes their ""likes"" and ""dislikes"". For me, this was especially distracting at the beginning of the film, when new characters came onto the screen so quickly that it was difficult to keep track of them all. Also, I may be alone, but I find the concept of judging a person by what they ""like"" and ""dislike"" to be a very shallow way of looking at them.The narrator is the ""easy way around"", but I don't think he's the best; sometimes, I really wished that Jeunet would use him less and use other ways, such as images, sequences, or conversations to tell the story.Another thing that bothered me was the film's attitude to love (don't read the next sentence if you're underage); that true love comes only through flirting and passionate sex. There is NEVER any conversation between the people in the film who are in love that would show that they love each other for something other than their bodies or their outward mannerisms; instead, it's all instinctive, impulsive, physical love. Really, I found it a bit silly, shallow and demeaning to the viewer.Thirdly, almost all of the characters in this film, including Amelie, are so different from me or anybody I know that I simply can't relate with them at all (with a few exceptions like the ""Glass Man"" or his assistant). Most of them are well acted (like the man who played the ""Glass Man""'s assistant, the immigrant artist/fruit-stand worker; brilliant), but I also find myself not finding them very interesting or realistic, and the ones that I DO find interesting are not the main characters...Lastly, the story still feels too ""fake"", a leftover from the director's previous films. It was fine in ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Delicatessen"", where I suspended my disbelief somewhat because they obviously took place in alternate universes to ours. ""Amelie"", however, is too close to the ""real world"" for me to make those same kind of allowances. It often seemed too ""glossy"" a picture of the real world to me (I know that this is what Jeunet was going for, but that doesn't mean I have to like it).Having now displayed all of the reasons why I DIDN'T like it, you may be wandering why I'm still giving it 4 stars. :)Basically, because despite all of the flaws, it was brilliantly filmed, suceeded often enough to keep it interesting, and left me feeling relatively satisfied at the end. Most of you will probably love it; if the premise sounds like something that you would like, then go ahead and give it a try. Personally, I wasn't sure that it was quite my type of film, and I turned out to be correct in that regard. If I had to rate it, I'd give it somewhere between 75-79/100."	4.0	"Personally, I prefer ""City of Lost Children""..."	2004-10-14	0	0	0

The description is misleading and just plain wrong - this isn't about a girl who does ""benevolent acts"". This is about one weird, introverted young girl who was raised by dysfunctional parents and is pretty much a psycho, albeit a charming one. She's not ""doing good deeds"", she pulling PRANKS on unsuspecting neighbors and random strangers. Some are cute and good-natured, others downright wrong and cruel (causing a guy to be electrocuted is hardly ""benevolent"", or funny for that matter). When she falls in love (or thinks she falls in love), she is incapable of communicating her feelings, so instead she stalks the poor bloke. The kind of person Amelie is might make you wonder if she perhaps had body parts stacked up in her freezer. Maybe that was the whole point, I don't know... Either way, I think it was the fact of the lead acress being so utterly, completely adorable that is this film's saving grace. Sure, it's whimsical, intriguing, funny, colorful, and has that goofy, surreal French flare all over it, but in the end... It's still about absolutely nothing. You expect some awesome, fantastic resolution to the events that unfold before you (even body parts in the freezer would've made it better). What you're left with is nothing. Not a bad film....

In this particular film there is a touch of &quot;SnowWhite and the 7 dwarfs&quot;: Amelie actually meddles with 7 diminutive (or somewhat damaged) male subjects, not to mention the garden gnome.Am I cynical? yes, but films carry messages, and very strong one too.

Yes, she will revenge people who have been mean to herself or someone she likes. Yes, she will steal her father's gnome and send it along with someone who is traveling with picture updats :)). Yes she will cut and paste her neighbor's past husband's letter into a new one, then sent it to the neighbor as a lost letter found up in Mount Blanc. Yes, no matter she goes she will always notice the stone she likes for skipping it. And yes, she will hear Stalin telling her not to care about what the glass man told her.There are so man things in this movie that will make you smile. My favorite parts were that she went to the photo booth with Zorro's uniform (she imagined it, too, while she revenged on the grocery shop owner for one-armed Lucien); and when Nino first went to the coffee shop while she stood behind and denying she was the Zorror girl and pass a piece of paper to him. Kind of remind me some childish love in young age. Well, I guess her childish (or genuine I should say) nature is the momentum of the movie and is what makes her so cute. I must applaud for Audrey Tautou. She did an incredible job being Amelie.It's hard to end this comment because there are so much to say about, but I will just end it this way. Watching Amelie is just like reading Zola's story. While following Amelie through her daily life, we have all become herself in the end of film.

It's made almost from a child's point of view and is the ultimate feel-good movie, but deftly avoids falling into condescension, a problem that plagues most movies of this kind. It teases itself and its characters--take for example, the scene when Amelie imagines her own death and the thousands whom she has helped mourning for her, or the fact that the 'prince charming' of the film is a clerk in a porn shop. The movie looks and feels like a daydream. Don't watch it for enlightenment or serious consideration of some important issues.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	I don't often view foreign language films.  I find it maddening to try to read the subtitles and watch the film at the same time.  Also, I had heard such glowing reviews about this film that I was prepared to be disappointed as well as frazzled.  I could not have been more wrong.This is a wonderful, wonderful film.  Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a mousey girl living in Paris whose life is so ordinary that it borders on pathetic.  One day she discovers a tin box in her apartment with little toys and keepsakes of a young child that was hidden behind a wall decades ago.  She sets out on a mission to find the boy and return the treasures to him.  If the mission has a positive effect, she vows to devote herself to doing good deeds for others.  This leads to numerous touching and droll adventures, where Amelie doles out her own personal brand of justice to various characters, both good and evil.  Along the way she discovers love and turns it into a cat and mouse game of mystery and fascination, making her lover fall for her and pursue her without ever knowing who she is.The story is brilliantly written, with a wry sense of humor.  Only the French could make mundane situations so funny, ironic, charming and philosophical at the same time.  It is a marvelous mix of intrigue, misdirection and offbeat humor.  Director Jean Pierre Jeunet squeezes the maximum amount of wit, sentimentality and humanness from every frame.  The Parisian street scenes are wonderfully done showing us more of an insider's look at Paris than a tourist's guidebook.Audrey Tautou is captivating in the lead role.  She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn, full of breathy enthusiasm with a twinkle in her eye and mischief on her mind.  When she is good she's wonderful, and when she's bad she's even better.This is an enthralling delight of a film, like a glass of sparkling French burgundy.  It will make you chuckle and tug your heart strings.  I rated it a 10/10.  Even if you hate subtitles, see this film.  You won't regret it.	5.0	Delicious, like a glass of sparkling burgundy	2002-08-09	17	17	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	&quot;Amelie&quot; is one of the few foreign-language films to use the DVD format to its potential. The director, enthusiastic DVD collector Jean-Pierre Jeunet, says he was inspired by M. Night Shyamalan's work on the first &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; DVD and by Sylvester Stallone's &quot;Rocky&quot; commentary. Jeunet, who recently polished up his English, can be hard to understand at first, but soon proves a captivating storyteller.Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel's bold images are captured in widescreen (2.35:1), with enhancements for 16:9 monitors. The odd but captivating green color scheme, saturated to verdant plushness in digital post-production, looks great. The cirque reds, blues and yellows retain their vibrant pop. The Dolby Digital (5.1) audio, however, fails to keep up with the playfulness of the Oscar-nominated sound editing (no DTS, alas). Still, the sound is strong and clear. Rear speakers are used sparingly, leaving the heavy lifting to the front three. Center channel voices are clear and resonant without boominess; the subwoofer stays busy keeping up with the boomerang dynamics.A 13-minute featurette on &quot;The Look of 'Amelie' &quot; shows Jeunet working his visual magic. Jeunet replaced the sky in many of his outdoor shots, preferring to create his own weather digitally. The seemingly naturalist film is in fact crammed with special effects, he points out. A scene in which Amelie skips rocks across water was done digitally because the actress couldn't get the hang of throwing stones. The &quot;explosion of color&quot; in the film came as digital timing was manipulated to saturate the images. &quot;We could change everything (digitally),&quot; Jeunet says. &quot;It was a miracle.&quot;Although the movie was written for Emily Lloyd, we know Amelie as French actress Audrey Tautou, the highly photogenic but rubber-faced comedienne who charmed audiences worldwide. Disc 2 includes her screen test, which made the director's casting decision an easy one. (There are a few clips of the actress having her long hair cut into the famed Amelie bob and some funny blooper clips.)True to the spirit of &quot;Amelie,&quot; the typical making-of featurette is replaced by &quot;home movies&quot; that have fun with elements from the film such as the photo-booth snapshots and the hilarious orgasm blitz. The screen-test section includes a must-see performance by Yolande Mureau, who powered her way into the role of Amelie's landlady.Menu screens are beautifully done, mixing stylized cast photos and scratchy moving images	4.0	A date with Amelie	2002-07-22	3	2	1

It is so bright, colorful, and vibrant. Even though we know that Paris looks nothing like this, it is fun to dream. I especially love the pictures of the Gnome on his travels. The special features in this set are top notch. This film was meant to be viewed in French, so there is of course no English dubbing. All I can say about that is, Thank God! I can't even imagine watching this movie waith someone other than Ms. Tautou being the voice of Amelie. It is a clever, and truly life-changing film. After you watch this movie, you will never look at the movie industry the same way again!	5.0	Amelie. She'll change your life....	2007-01-10	2	2	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA	FrontPage	I first noticed &quot;Amelie&quot; when going through the local DVD rental store... A woman told me that she couldn't get past the cover art of the washed- out face of Amelie to try renting the movie. The exterior art, honestly does no justice whatsoever to the gem of a disc inside (the character does not look pale like the cover photo suggests).I get very curious about the obscure titles -- especially the foreign films -- that wind up on the shelves of the rental stores, so I write down title names and surf imdb.com (internet movie database) to learn more about titles I haven't recognized. And after reading the reviews, I decided to grab the less- than- attractive box and check out the movie.Immediately as the root menu is accessed, some rather inviting music accompanies the animated menu. So I set up the audio (no English dub, it's French language in digital 5.1 audio) and was blown away from the moment the opening scene played.I knew from the first scene that this had the potential of being a well- written, acted, scripted, and produced movie. And as the credits rolled at the end, I wanted to see more of Amelie, who was a wonderful and genuine character, one you wished lived in your own neighborhood. And I also believe that both women and men would really enjoy this. Most guys would fall in love with Amelie's eyes, and more women would enjoy the sensitive style of creatively showing a woman's emotions. But I get the sense that a few women may not care for Amelie's character, honestly.The original music (no lyrics) of composer Yann Tiersen will stay in your head, even if you can't get past the subtitles. Tiersen did a fabulous job of creating a score that suits every scene it's played in. The audio is rich and expansive, and can be enjoyed with even the most basic speakers.&quot;Amelie&quot; makes me wish that I had learned French, and I envy anyone who understands the language for being able to understand the dialogue without having to read a translation. It can be a little difficult to have to watch two things at once -- subtitles and a movie -- because early on, you'll feel like you're missing the movie everytime you have to read the translation. But trust me on this, &quot;Amelie from Montmartre&quot; is a movie that you'll enjoy watching again and again. It's a rare treat to find a movie that doesn't get &quot;tired.&quot; And as you watch &quot;Amelie&quot; again, you'll enjoy more of the cinematography and the lush, saturated colorful scenes.The DVD has many different options to dive into, which is a great thing since you'll probably fall in love with &quot;Amelie.&quot;PS- For lovers of traditional blues, watch for a B&amp;W clip on the television of an elderly one- legged man tap dancing. His name is &quot;Peg Leg&quot; Sam (Jackson), and there are two CDs of music that this late singer recorded, &quot;Kickin' It&quot; and &quot;Early in the Morning.&quot; Well worth the search.	5.0	Look Past the Cover Art!	2003-09-12	28	24	4

It is that I don't find it fabulous, amazing, and original enough to grant its status of one of the greatest movies ever made according the multiple top lists. One of the IMDB reviewers described ""Amelie"" the best: ""sweet, sweet, sweet"" - and that triple sweetness was a bit too much for my taste, I guess. I found it amusing and very good looking but the story of a naive shy young girl who found her destiny in making people around her happy by helping them find love and while doing so, finding her own love, as sweet as it sounds, left me indifferent. To sum up, for me, ""Amelie"" is a pleasant little movie but not a timeless masterpiece which would stay in my memory for long time."	3.0	"""It's better to help people than garden gnomes."""	2008-03-04	4	1	3

I think that may also be true with art (painting, poetry, literature, music, and movies); there is one great painting, one great poem, one book, one song, and one movie that is part of your connection to the Big Scheme of Things. For me, Amelie is that One Movie.This is a movie that could never have been made in Hollywood -- actually I can't imagine anyone in the US making a film as good as this. It's not your cynical highly over-rated Robert Altman flick, or your totally stupid Shallow Hal waste if time.But what is it than? It's a movie you see and feel with your heart -- go see it.

B0000640VO	Amelie	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	With its opening sequence of kalidescopic visuals and rapid-fire narration, viewers who do not speak French (myself included) are likely to find Jean-Pierre Jeunet's celebrated AMELIE a challenge, for it is rather difficult to watch the film and read the subtitles at the same time.  That said, once you are able to sycronize these elements in your head, you are in for a treat: AMELIE is simply one of the most charming films to emerge from France in many, many years.Considering that the film is both foreign and subtitled, and therefore presumably has a somewhat limited appeal for English-only audiences, it's story has become remarkably well-known in a very short time among English-only audiences--a fact that attests to its power.  Amelie is a shy, somewhat reclusive young woman, the product of an emotionally distant father and profoundly neurotic mother, who hides from life as a waitress in a small cafe while cultivating &quot;small pleasures&quot;--skipping stones over water, dipping her hands into sacks of grain at the local market to feel the texture, and the like.  One day she discovers a box hidden behind the wall of her apartment bathroom, a tiny box filled with childhood toys stashed away by a long-ago childhood tenent.  She sets out to return them to the now-adult man who hid and forgot them so many years before... and when she sees his pleasure she finds a purpose in life: she will secretly do things to make others happier in their life, thereby vicariously living out the happiness she herself is afraid to accept.  In the process she not only brings life-changing joy to those around her, but she discovers her own need for happiness and the courage to change that she might experience happiness for herself.The story is actually quite slight, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, his star Audrey Tautou, and a remarkable cast of supporting players give it tremendous style and an unexpectedly self-mocking sense of humor.  The film is full of visual metaphors: at various moments we see the hearts of different characters beating inside their bodies, Amelie fantasizes about hearing herself lectured by the television, the object of her affection is teased by talking photographs, and in one particularly memorable scene Amelie's disappointment is envisioned by morphing her body into a column of water that collapses with a splash to the ground.  The characters are mix of archetypes and glitchy eccentricity; the cinematography is shockingly beautiful; and everything about the film is gentle, sweetly funny, and sure to leave you with a Gallic smile and a wish that life were actually like that.Tautou is a remarkable young actress who has been widely compared to both Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron--and indeed there is more than a passing similarity.  But she plays the title role with a knowing quality that belongs to her alone, and although the role (and indeed all roles in the film) is essentially archetypical her performance has a youthful grace slightly tempered by unexpected self-awareness: extremely effective and extremely endearing.  The film would be worth seeing for this performance alone, but fortunately AMELIE is remarkably rich in all its elements.Those expecting &quot;depth&quot; may disappointed, for the life-lessons the films offers are not profound in themselves; others may find the film's odd mix of Brechtian distance, sly wit, and warmth a bit off-putting--and it would be easy to read the film as a somewhat diadactic comedy that doesn't entirely come off.  But if you can grasp the thought that the film isn't about anything beyond making you chuckle, smile, and rejoice in the small pleasures of life, you will find it extremely, extremely enjoyable.  The DVD comes with a second disk full of extras, including audition footage, outtakes, and the like that both cinephiles and Francophiles are sure enjoy.

A friend tricked me into seeing ""Amelie"", and I entered the theatre prepared to throw popcorn at the screen and yell sarcastic remarks at the corny parts. Being a crumudgeon is an ugly job, but someone's got to do it. I was tricked! I didn't realize that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet had a secret weapon, Audrey Tautou, and I was reduced to this weepy/happy old fool. The magical Ms. Tautou captured my heart and soul in the role of the Parisian merry prankster, Amelie. This is the movie that should sweep the Oscars, but probably won't win a single one, because it's a French production. So on Oscar night, when ""Amelie"" goes unnoticed, I can throw popcorn at my T.V. screen and yell sarcastic remarks at boneheads of the Academy.

Few films make me actually laugh out loud, but Amelie is at the top of the list.  If the Coen brothers made french romantic comedies, this would be the result - a refreshinly bittersweet romantic comedy that is always just slightly left of center.  The charming direction and cinematography add to the bitingly funny story of a young woman struggling to reconcile her rich fantasy life with reality, her quest for romance, and the desire to create a beautiful world for those around her.  Hollywood would be hard-pressed to make a film that compares to Amelie, so be sure not to miss out on the original.	5.0	Subtitles?  So What?!	2003-07-09	4	3	1

I think the story is going this way, and it goes another and I remember, &#34;oh, that's right&#34;.  Like many films these days, it's a film set in a real world location (Paris) but filmed in colors and styles of clothing that create a fantasy world within reality.  Much of the film is about Amelie's search for a man whose childhood box of toys she finds hidden in a wall; with another line pursuing a man whose photos she finds near photo booths;  Who is he?  Why is he taking these pictures?  And, it's a bit of a gawky romance between her oddball character and an equally geeky guy she's known for a while.  It's not a film I would watch over and over, but I have seen it more than once and always enjoyed watching.And, if you find yourself in Paris, go to the subway stop in the movie, Abbesses.  It's near Monmartre and Sacre Cour, and has (in a subway system that is itself almost defined by its staircases) one of the longest spiral staircases I've been on this side of the Statue of Liberty or Sacre Cour.

Shkodra	"I don't think an artwork, whether a movie, a book or a theater play can change a man's life; it can change your mood for a few minutes, at least, and/or it can make you reflect about many things in your life, at most. ""Le fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain"" is one of those movies that can make you laugh, feel good and reflect about how many little and seemingly unimportant things can change your life or at least the way you see it. This is such an uplifting and heartwarming piece of art that it makes you want to get out of your appartment and go talk to your next door neighbour whom you've never said hello to.Luckily enough, the director has no pretention for his movie to be very deep; it's about redemption, about trying to find a reason to live and enjoy your life, even when it doesn't appear to make sense to you.  Although it tends to flag a little towards the end, despite a somewhat sensory overload and the fact that there's whimsy to be had just about everywhere (hey, it's a french movie!), the voiceover brilliantly summarizing most of Am&eacute;lie's life, the giddy accordion strains, the beautiful colors, the rare but breathtaking landscapes of the whimsy magic town, the fabulous performance offered by Audrey Tautou make of Am&eacute;lie a wonderful film."	4.0	For those who are bummed out about life!	2003-02-24	0	0	0

I bought the DVD on a complete whim without knowing anything about the story, and I am so glad that I did. It's a movie set in reality, in Paris, but it is made to look magical with a rich and oftentimes surreal undercurrent. The cinematography is unlike anything I've seen for a romantic movie; the rich reds, greens and occasional blues paint such a vivid and vibrant picture that fits the whole atmosphere perfectly. More than just the elements of the movie though, there are the two main characters of Amelie and Nino, whose connection is quite tangible even though they rarely share the screen at all. This is a movie that makes me happy, that makes me think that good does exist and that anything is possible.

I will spare the reader a lengthy dissection by summarizing that this movie is whimsical, magical and poignant.Amelie is a shy girl with an innocent but slightly offbeat sense of humor who goes about trying to right the wrongs of the world and heal broken hearts. But her shyness thwarts her from finding love and happiness for herself. In time well...you just have to see the movie.The movie is full of wonderful sight gags that sometimes are surreal (some of this done with very subtle animation). The movie starts with Amelie coming into the world moves us through her childhood and brings us up to her adulthood. Each episode of her life is portrayed with whimsy irony and humor. It is filled with side jokes like her father's mysterious traveling garden gnome and her almost mythic quest for the man who leaves his photo booth picture all over Paris. Poor Amelie has such insight into the people she knows and such a curiosity of those, like the mystery man in the photos, whom she does not know.Everything about the movie, the acting, the dialogue the plot and even the color palette of the movie cry out with a joy for life, especially for life's absurdities. In it's wackiness it is also a wise movie.Every household should own a copy of this movie in the same way every household should own Band-Aids and aspirin because this movie is a cure-all for the blues.Highly recommended.	5.0	Delightful	2005-05-02	0	0	0

This movie is nothing I would have picked to watch (someone else made me watch it), but it was just odd enough to capture my attention.  First we start off with Amelie's conception and then it highlights certain pivotal moments of her childhood.  GENIUS!  Without giving too much away, we see her craftiness in childhood when she takes revenge.  Another moment of GENIUS!  The director is genius.  This movie is genius.Great scenery.  Great acting.  Great casting.  Amelie is very relatable, especially to other introverts.  I found myself reminiscing on how I was like her when I was younger and more shy.  Audrey Tautou reminded me of Audrey Hepburn.  They couldn't have picked a more gorgeous Amelie.Bise, bise!  Au revoir!	5.0	Quirky and I Love It!	2014-04-08	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	Every few years or so, I remember to fall in love with Am&eacute;lie Poulain all over again. This movie, AMELIE, won't at all topsy-turvy the French's rep for artsyfartsy cinema, but never mind. AMELIE, which came out in 2001, is an imaginative bit of whimsy, an enchanting romantic comedy, a droll time at the movies, a quirky tutorial on contemporary Parisian living. It tells the story of a painfully shy Parisian girl who conquers her fears to perform good deeds on the sly. In service of this, she - Am&eacute;lie Poulain - becomes a travel agent... a poltergeist... a secret matchmaker... She becomes guardian angel to those around her. And, somewhere along the way, she stumbles onto her own slice of happiness. It's somehow all very French.It hinges on that expressive actress, Audrey Tautou, her gamine charms, her mischievous smile. She infuses such vivid life in Am&eacute;lie, a young woman whom as a child was conspired against by fate. Am&eacute;lie grew up isolated and introverted and unusual. As the narrative proper begins, we see her whiling away her days as a waitress in the quaint Parisian cafe, the Two Windmills. Am&eacute;lie's staid existence shatters one evening when she discovers in her apartment an old metal box nestled behind a wall tile. On a whim, she determines to locate the owner of the box and deliver unto him its contents of childhood memorabilia. This is the first link to a chain of remarkable circumstances.Am&eacute;lie's success with her modest mission inspires her to further acts of kindness. She brightens a blind man's day. She kindles a romance between a stalker and a frumpy hyponchondriac waitress. Because of her machinations, an abusive vegetable vendor gets his past-due comeuppance. She befriends a painter cursed with brittle bones. She sends a garden gnome off to see the world, and deploys the occasional postcard to its reclusive (and thoroughly baffled) owner. Yeah, Am&eacute;lie is having a fine time playing the covert benefactor, tinkering and meddling and orchestrating. But when she gets a chance for her own happy ending, will she be equally as bold? Am&eacute;lie Poulain, who is so shy. Qu'allez-vous faire?The first hour of the film really sells it for me, brimming as it does with captivating visual flights of fancy and offbeat, often sardonic humor. And I love that there's a whiff, just a whiff, of magic realism in play (a refined shout out to those who've enjoyedChocolat (Miramax Collector's Series),Penelope,L.A. Story,The Milagro Beanfield War, etc.). Towering above all else in this film is Audrey Tautou, she of the waifish, puckish persuasion. There is simply something so irresistible about her. So, yeah, every few years I'm compelled to fall in love with her character, with Am&eacute;lie Poulain. AMELIE not only makes me like reading sub-titles, it makes me yearn to learn French just so I can relish them nuances one can only capture when absorbing the film's original language. And that globe-trotting garden gnome, it must have stories to tell, yeah?	5.0	"""Only the discoverer of Tutankhamen's tomb would know how she felt upon finding this treasure..."""	2012-05-10	2	1	1

The garden gnome incident is priceless! I would place this more in the comedy than the romance department, though I almsot cried when little Amelie lost her fish. I thought the actress who played Amelie was a little creepy, but perfect for the role.  The plot was fresh and hysterically funny, and one of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't try too hard. The humor and romance (and sorrow) are all served up so naturally that you barely have time to catch your breath and wipe your eyes before something else is making you crack up. This movie was truly heartwarming, especially the incident with the spinster widow downstairs, whose husband left her. Once or twice the subtitles ran too fast for me to catch up, and I thought the nudity and sex (little though it was) was unecessary.  It still didn't detract at all from this suprising and hilarious little French import.  Well done!	5.0	What a funny film!	2003-07-06	4	1	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	Amelie is a song to the life. In many aspects this film reperesents what Jupiter (Symphonie 41) of Wolfang Amadeus Mozart means in the music; the supreme freedom.Not only it's a oda to the savoir vivre , (it's a free film) but instead it has a deep sense of no matter what; keep going and go ahead, that sooner or later you win.It's literally impossible not fall in love with Audrey Tatou. Her beauty, charm, shyness,charisma and sympathy let you amazing.One overwhelming script; written with a fertile imagination , it contains a lot of delightful situations and enjoyable moments. I've seen at least ten times from 2001, and it shines by itself like a diamond; it has too,  a lot of countless virtues, the prodigious camera makes lovely travellings, fluid dolly, and the photograph is unique.Besides you have other depicted characters that support the story and never let you down.A film made and surrounded by a supreme good taste; more you can expect and much more.Haven't you watched it? and what are you waiting for?A must for you.This film didn't win the Oscar.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1HO4DCVV5DK4B	"Howardtheburntone ""leguignol"""	...And just about everyone else, too. Whatever baggage you may or may not have concerning foreign films- drop it now. Amelie is perhaps the most exuberant, joyful movie to pop along in ages. Lovingly made: the acting, the shot composition, the editing and the (very, very) subtle use of CGI... Wide screen is a must for this one, as much of the film's beauty is chopped out in the VHS release (such as one scene, where Amelie is sitting in front of the TV in a room that's nigh entirely red- save for a small blue lamp to her left. It's a tiny detail, but it fleshes out everything wonderfully- closed captioned: the lamp is gone). Little things, definitely. But then, this is a movie that is all about the tiny details in life...Yes, it's a love story, and as sweet as they come. No need to further belabor that aspect or give away any moments. But you will be surprised many times over. You will laugh at loud. And you will want to watch it again and again, especially with someone you can touch close by. And if you don't have someone- this movie may provide the much-needed impetus to go to France and start turning (not to mention skipping) stones (the shots of the city are marvellous).Then there's Audrey Tautou, whose expressive face is the axis of the movie. Amelie holds your gaze like a naissance de millennium Audrey Hepburn. She has an elfin grace that is utterly sublime and unique. When Amelie smiles, you smile with her.If you have seen it, then you know why you should own this one- movies like this simply aren't made that often. Especially with such skill and flair (this was, I believe, the cinematographer's first feature, though I may be mistaken...) If you haven't seen it- trust a stranger. This film will add something light and hopeful and precious to your life.	5.0	A must for anyone who loves beautiful movies...	2002-09-19	1	1	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	AUPELMTYWR73S	I. Al Chalabi	One of the most beautiful films I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time, Amelie captures the audience's hearts and minds from the very start. It draws attention to life's subtle yet moving moments and combines it with simple every day events that many of us have grown numb to in our hectic modern day lives. Set in the Monmartre district of Paris, Amelie is essentially a story about a shy, reserved and somewhat eccentric young girl who convinces herself that her mission on this planet is to help people, and so she sets out to do just that. At the same time, she finds herself falling in love with an equally quirky character who collects discarded photographs lying around photo booths. Fabulous escapism that's a breath of fresh air to watch and so different from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood movies of late where the actors and titles change, but the movies remain so similar.	5.0	A breat of fresh air	2001-12-01	3	2	1

You may be a little confused by the film as your eyes are glued to the subtitles, but the images really describe the movie so if you get a chance, look up!Am&eacute;lie Poulain is portrayed by the adorable French actress Audrey Tautou.

I like it more and more as I grow older. Incidentally, this was the biggest worldwide success of French cinema history. It's not a movie about falling in love, a ""do-good"" woman meeting her match, romancing in Paris, etc. It is a story about a woman learning how to seize the day and start to live, how to fight her own cowardice. In a way, it's as close to a feminine ""western"" in the Parisian Bistro settings as you can get. Yes, it's not easy to admit it, but I love it."	5.0	Carpe Diem	2011-04-17	0	0	0

The French language was a little fast, so thank goodness for the subtitles. Pair that with closed captioning, and nothing was missed. The scene with the couple in the bathroom is HILARIOUS.As you might expect, the French expect you to watch this with a grown-up sensibility; meaning they have what I consider a healthy view of sex. At any rate, it comes up a lot in this movie. Ah bon! The real title is the Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain. If you have more than a little high school French you figure that out.The actresses who play Amelie are adorable, both the six-year-old, and the 22-year-old! The older one is especially engaging, with her big eyes and cute haircut, but I gotta ask, do all young French women dress like Olive Oyl?? Amelie has an odd sense of fashion, for sure.Anyway, this movie gave me a really good laugh.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1GBGO2QKVS95D	"Jack Farnsworth ""Gloryroader"""	Starring Audrey Tautou as Amelie, this wonderfully executed emotional comedy will keep the interest of even the worst ADD sufferer. Although the dialogue is in Parisian French with English subtitles, this doesn't detract from the viewing experience like it does in some other foreign films.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and costarring Dominique Pinon (you'll see the same credits -- directed by and costarring -- in the wonderful French film &quot;Delicatessen&quot; and the American film &quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot;), &quot;Amelie&quot; was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Film. From her childhood and the comedic horror it wrought with a suicidal pet fish and the very unusual demise of her mother to her newfound purpose in life to help complete strangers this is a feel-good comedy full of surprises and wonderful visual effects. Amelie is kind of like Ally McBeal, without all the whining and self-pity. She has a very healthy imagination and sometimes retreats into it, but not to the point that she ignores the real world. In fact, she most often affects the real world using her imagination. She is not self-concious or shy, except when it comes to going after her own dreams. Watch as she struggles to decide whether to pursue her own desires or continue to do only for others.	5.0	The Best French Film I've Seen Recently!	2002-08-21	10	9	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A34A095NNHFMB5	Jack Felson	"See, I'm a French guy, I live in Paris and I know quite well about the area where this movie was shot. It's a poor, dirty area, with plenty of bums and rats, it's not at all like it is showed in the film. So don't get abused. This movie is just a postcard on celluloid, this is valuable only for the tourists.Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who before this ""Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" (the French title), had directed some pretty 'noir' and sordid movies like ""Delicatessen"", ""The City of the lost Children"" and ""Alien 4"", completely changed his vision for this film; he even changed his director of photography! For a single young girl, for her big eyes and her haircut in the Louise Brooks style only, he cleaned up the 18th district of Paris. Here, no rain, no bad weather, no clouds in the sky, no traffic jam, no pollution, no garbage bins, no dirt on the sidewalks, in the gutters and in railway and metro stations... which may be acceptable. But when he puts away all the poor elements - the Black and Arabian people, and the bums -, and gives to Jamel Debbouze (an Arabian comic, very well-known in France) a character with a typical French name - Lucien -, then we have the right to scream with fury and ask for the filmmaker to be on court martial. Maybe it's only a movie, and you can tell me this, but I think there's still some respect to be shown for the location and the people.But this is not the most disgusting look of the film. No, what can easily make you throw up is the emptiness of the treatment, there's no message at all, the story is ridiculous and unsignificant, and Amelie and Nino excepted, the characters don't evoluate, don't progress, they just keep turning around and around in closed spaces they practically never get out from. Amelie herself is quite irritating, she's not very intelligent, doesn't have any of the grace that all the medias gave her, and her stupid games and her way of minding the others' business are desperating. How can you be interested in such a character? The special effects are honeyed and add to the boring and too long aspect of the film, where nothing happens from the beginning to the ending. This movie, which received five Academy Award nominations, would have deserved the one for sugar. Mathieu Kassovitz, a shocker director, disappoints his fans with this sweethearted character, a little lost. Dominique Pinon (""The City of the lost Children"", ""Alien 4"") and Isabelle Nanty are very good, so is the ending, but it's not enough.The reasons of the success of this film are that it tells a fairy-tale in a real place, and portrays an ideal world, where everything is white, clean and neat, and in the end everything is always OK. We may be skeptical about this... In any case this movie is the proof that we can make any ... believable with a good dose of 'Chantilly' cream, when we see how successful and highrated it is..."	2.0	'Clean'... to the dirt - stay away from this...	2002-10-31	33	15	18

Can it be that I, as an adult, am meant to be charmed by the hijinks of a moron who interferes with any lives she has suddenly taken it into her pea brain to manipulate? Are we meant to hope that our lives were as storybook-colorful as those in the film who fall prey to her nearly terrifying in its ignorance meddling? The asinine antics this baby-talking idiot performs, such as with the grocer whom she so easily edges toward insanity, are hijacked from the world of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. And her own preposterous ploys to arrange it so that she is left all but sucking her thumb and pining for her--we suspect--slightly less retarded would-be beau while he emotionally snaps his fingers at just missing her and is left holding something that gives the time for their next annoyingly cute and predictably unconsummating rendezvous are ponderous, so ponderous.

The cinematography has a painter's touch, as the colors seem more vibrant and warm than in life; and yet the settings never struck me as being artificial.  The characters are also crafted with a similar flair; even minor characters seem like portraits having unexpected familiarity...  The soundtrack to the movie complements the action and the characters, and is a work of art in itself.The only negative aspect of the DVD (at least on mine, I bought it elsewhere) is that one can't view French subtitles, only English or Spanish.  The French would be helpful for anyone interested in learning French...  But that is a minor detail.	5.0	Better than good, Amelie is beautiful	2002-11-08	6	6	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1CN2WMP1YH95J	Jameson Rachen	Amelie is a weird, yet brilliant, combination of a child's fairy tale and early films by Jean-Luc Godard.  Maybe the plot isn't something Godard would approve of, or at least make (it's sappy and deals a lot with fantastic notions of fate).  But the playful nature in which Amelie deconstructs the components of cinema, is pure Godard.  The editing, use of sound, screen composition, all very playful, very critical, very calculated and perfect.And for someone that cringes at the thought of a sappy love story (Godard's Breathless is more to my liking as a love story), Amelie left me with a ear to ear grimace for hours after leaving the theater (each of the FOUR times I saw this).  In an age that movies don't seem to touch new ground, everything seems so bland, nothing has been as fresh as the early French New Wave, until Amelie...	5.0	Weird, brilliant, perfect	2003-05-20	2	2	0

As all good films should, sure, but more so.  First of all, if you're not fluent in French, you're obliged to read subtitles.  I generally avoid films with subtitles.  Let's face it, when we watch a movie we want to do just that, watch it.  However, watching AMELIE was sheer joy.  It was like being absorbed in a painting by a master who uses vibrant colors on her canvas.  It was like hearing a story by someone whose voice is so mesmerizing you literally hang on every word.

There were 2-4 nude scenes, but besides that, I loved it.Somehow I find it more difficult to comment on movies I liked. Perhaps this is because praise is harder to put into words than complaints, and merit is often less tangible.""Amelie"" is a movie I would highly recommend. I know, I know: it's already been labeled an international hit, but this is one of those rare occasions when a movie deserves the praise it has been showered with.It's fresh, original, beautifully shot, and features a memorable score that helps create its very special atmosphere. It leaves you with a wonderful feeling, like ""an orange-coloured day"", when nature is in bloom and harmony, inviting you to the celebration of life. It endows your memory with a picture album of those colourful, dynamic, artistic, often poetic sequences of which it is composed.""Amelie"" is not a simple fairytale, as some might think. There's a bit of everything in it: romance, mystery, philosophy, brilliant humour and whimsy. It touches upon many issues, but never ""in your face"". Obviously, it wasn't meant to mirror reality, so don't try to find flaws here. And I wouldn't encourage viewers to question some of Amelie's actions from the moral standpoint. Doing so would be taking the film too seriously, instead of just enjoying its mischievous twinkle.The plot is well-woven and a pleasure to follow. I've seen the movie several times, and it hasn't yet lost any of its charm.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1NITB9OBIW569	JDNM	"Charming and humane yet too many directorial missteps and plot holes deprive it of excellence. The single biggest flaw is that by the end of the movie Amelie still doesn't represent anything. She means well but her stratagems sometimes backfire (as with the romance she instigates at the cafe) and at other times reduces herself to the level of her antagonist (the revenge she seeks on the owner of the vegetable stand). As the man with the glass bones recognizes her subterfuges are simply dodges around her own faint heart. Despite all the directorial prancing and narrative quirkiness she winds up in bed at the end with her new love like any ordinary couple. The ending doesn't bring a sense triumph and cheer but simply a sense of relief that the drama is finally over.Amelie is a good movie. It is well placed and despite the fact the lead character is something of an oddball the narrative never strains credulity. The lead character is likable enough that we want her to succeed and different enough to be entertaining. Those who enjoy ""art for art's sake"" will love this move but those wishing for some moral heft will be disappointed."	4.0	Charming and humane but flawed	2013-07-13	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1YDPPCDXAPDLH	"""jeanne_gris"""	A splendid script, an actress who distills Chaplin, Audrey Hepburn, and Marilyn Monroe, the most creative use of digital effects to help the storyline, an effervescent score --- it was criminal that it was denied best foreign film.  Like all of us, Amelie weaves personal mythology and dreamscape into a life which is far more than any exterior observer (all but one, the Glass Man, whose fragile bones keep him indoors painting and repainting a Renoir, while observing her across the way) can imagine. When she discovers a tin box holding some boy's memorabilia from decades back, she decides to return Lost Time to him, and finds that small acts can tilt others' destinies around her in unexpected ways. Also like all of us, when the same forces evidently conspire to give her the perfect invitation to introduce herself to the man she's most attracted to, she weaves an elaborate trail of clues and evasions through Paris, tempting fate with a sort of child's gamble, desperately hoping that destiny will, no matter how much she runs from it, bring them together.The film is filled with sharp little surprises and sudden laughter as her match-making gambits, her schemes of retribution against the vegetable seller who abuses his retarded assistant, and the plan to get her father to follow in the footsteps of the globe-trotting garden gnome she steals from his garden, all pay off.This vision of one young woman's inner world and her conspiracy to outwit mundane fate has the dreamlike timelessness that mark the best films ever made. A film that can fill one with warmth and bring a smile to the face just by telling another person about it is very, very rare.	5.0	rarest blend of filmmaking	2002-06-20	14	13	1

Of course, serial infidelities and street prostitution *are* pretty delightful, so it's probably just me being a pill...Instead of taking rather ugly situations and insisting without any particular proof that they are adorable or romantic, ""Amelie"" shows the effect that a particular mindset can produce, making the very ordinary into something magical.  While not exactly an advertisement for the Power of Positive Thinking, the advantages of a mischievous, curious approach to life are certainly amplified here.""Amelie"" is not all sweetness and light.  Despite her appeal, the character Amelie is sly and secretive and has an unsettling disregard for the consequences of her actions.  Her playfulness takes on an air of cruelty in her treatment of the mean-spirited greengrocer, and I began to wonder if she orchestrated the romance for her co-worker out of friendship or spite... However, it is her playfulness that, for better or worse, makes things happen.Unlike most movies meant to entrance audiences (i.e., like those named above), ""Amelie"" takes place in a recognizable world where all the ordinary rules apply. Except for the contrivance of Amelie's occasional asides to the camera, demonstrating the workings of her busy mind, nothing happens in this movie that could not happen in real life.  The charm of this film rests on these practical underpinnings, and it is Amelie's imagination which provides the glow.Having never been to Paris, I can only say that the Paris of this film looks and feels exactly like Paris is supposed to:  twisty little streets, tilty old buildings, wheezy accordions, and ample evidence of le chic which happens to be very shabby.  And so far as the look of Amelie herself, so much has been said about Audrey Tautou and her doll-like, anime-eyed darlingness that I needn't say anything more on the subject.  Oh, OK, one more thing:  she makes a very sexy Zorro!So Amelie's love interest works in a porn shop.  So people in France have (not-very-graphic, actually) sex.  The sexual content is minimal and struck me as being mostly farcical - it's romance that is taken seriously here. I have no kids, but I think many would find it OK for older children, especially since there's so much else to enjoy - I would be more concerned about a child's ability to read the subtitles and keep up with the story!"	5.0	the surprising romance of photobooths	2002-08-02	1	1	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2OP1HD9RGX5OW	"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name"""	Without a doubt the best movie I've seen this year.  Amelie was wonderful, imaginative, and hyperbolic in all ways.  She sees life with such romance and wonder- although not always happily.  And her desire to do things for other people anonymously springs not so much from a Pollyanish ideal as the romantic ideal of the INFJ- to see mystery in life, and create mystery in others.  Beyond the rich characters, the cinematography and sound editing are fantastic.  The sights and sound are so vivid one feels like they can actually touch the movie's insides, taste the stars, and eat the light.  After leaving the film I yearned to see all the details of life as she does.  I was rewarded crossing the floating bridge next to Seattle, and seeing the left side storm tossed with tall waves of foam; the right side completely placid and calm like a small pond on a hot, breezeless day.  This is the imagery of the film, and the benefits from seeing it.	5.0	A Movie You Can Taste	2001-12-30	3	2	1

It's fun, interesting, and thought provoking but also a little silly and perhaps strange. Amelie encounters many questions in her pursuit of happiness and fulfillment. At what point do we stop helping others and begin to help ourselves? Is it alright to interfere in others' lives? And when is it ok to take a risk? For me, the movie wasn't about the destination, but the journey itself. Enjoy!	5.0	The fabulous destiny of Amelie	2002-10-24	2	2	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3A4VE1I13YLG2	"Jennifer Lee ""nebeel"""	I went into this film expecting a cute film about nothing.  I got more than that.  This film was a cute take on the life of a girl (obviously Amelie) who has a strange life.  It starts off by introducing random points that are happening simultaneously.  Her parents are brought into the film through their likes and dislikes.  The random odd-ballness was appealing and catching.  It was hard not to like this film.  It starts off a little strange, but eventually grows into an simple storyline, though in no way boring or dull.  This film gave me a sense of peace by the end, and I could not help but smile.  She herself is an adorable character and easily lovable.  The director portrays France in a way that promotes roundness.  Everything is color coordinated and perfectly fitting.  The clothes of the characters, the attitudes of certain people in relation to their physical appearances.  This movie is about two hours long and there was never a tiring moment.  I highly recommend this movie.  It makes one light-hearted and feel happy about things later.  It has it's unusual parts, such as a porn shop, but these add to the personality of everything.  More or less this movie is about a girl who decideds to change lives.  It's made in a style where one can easily follow along and relate.  Enjoyable.	5.0	An Adorable French Film	2001-11-25	12	10	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	AWA0CA9AYL5YQ	Jennifer Litchfield	Amelie is an extraordinary film, and this makes the ordinariness of its conclusion profoundly unsatisfying.  Throughout the movie (known as Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain in its country of origin, France) the characters are presented as delightfully quirky - Amelie enjoys running her hands through sackfuls of grain; her father likes lining up his shoes and polishing them; Nino keeps an album of photos discarded by their owners - so the ending, where Amelie and Nino leap into bed together, just as would happen in any other movie, is a huge letdown.The premise is simple: one day Amelie Poulain finds a small box of 'treasures', which would appear to have been hidden by a small boy 40 years ago.  She decides to return the box to its owner, and if he is appreciative she will continue in her quest to help those around her.One of the strengths of the film is that - much like real life - nobody is 'normal'.  As well as being introduced to characters, we are also shown their idiosyncrasies and history. However, Amelie's running time of over two hours feels too long and one gets the impression that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has attempted to fit too much into what is a light-weight movie.It is also very funny in places, notably when Amelie takes revenge on an intolerant neighbour.  It is interesting how we can, after an interval of five years, look back on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and recall with a wry smile how completely it consumed our attention at the time.  Overall this is a charming and whimsical film (even if at times it is a little too aware of its quaintness), and certainly deserving of a more fitting finale.	3.0	&quot;She cultivates a taste for small pleasures&quot;	2003-07-26	14	5	9

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1B3HGBE9GAI08	Jeremy Heilman	(...)The story begins by recounting the simultaneous occurrences at the moment when Amelie (Audrey Tautou in what is barely allowed to be a performance) was conceived. This fascination with coincidence continues throughout, and seems to be cribbed, like the film's updates on the state of the weather from PT Anderson's Magnolia, and really neither seems to add anything to the film. We get to see Amelie grow up in the film's frenzied opening moments, and the combination of many short scenes accompanied by voiceover narration feels like early Godard or Truffaut's Jules and Jim (which Amelie attends a screening of). Still, this grows tiresome in a way that  their films didn't. When every shot is meant to amaze, none do.Once the film settles down on the adult Amelie in 1997, she seems relatively well adjusted even though she lost her mother at an early age and she didn't get enough hugs from her father. She engages in casual sex and seems rather content and unquestioning in life. Once she hears news of Princess Diana's death on television, however, she seems to regress into a childlike state. She seems to be stunned by the announcement of that tragedy, and her attentions become diverted immediately upon hearing it by a small tin box filled with children's toys that she finds. She becomes obsessed with the toys, and with finding their owner, and is able to literally shut the news of the princess' death off once she finds them. It's almost as if she reverts to being the girl that she was before her mother was killed. She seems to recreate herself as a princess in order to deny the loss of Diana. Suddenly, she needs more than just sex. She needs Romance, Love, and Justice... all with a capital letters! Her views of the world regress until they have a childlike simplicity. She begins playing tricks again on those that are mean, as she did when she was a child. She seems to become repulsed by sex without love (she tries to block it out when it rears his head by turning on a cappuccino machine or by hanging up a phone).The man that she becomes attracted to is presented as a phallic nightmare. He works in a sex shop(...). Although Amelie is not a virgin, she sure acts like one in his presence. He catches Amelie's eye, but she is unable to approach him. She ends up creating a series of coy games to lure him to her. She has problems relating to other people, and initially communicates with them through notes, film clips, or her own imagination. She begins to apply her principles to the world around her. She becomes consumed by her childlike idealism, and is petulant when the world does not bend to her ideals. This transformation is interesting, but the film flubs badly when it wants us to approve of it. Of course, Amelie is optimistic, and that's great, but she is also detached from any rational understanding of the world. Her idealization of her mate results in a one-sided relationship that doesn't seem to function on any mature, adult level. Her never-ending winsomeness seems to ignore the world around her, and the film never calls her bluff. It's infuriating.This fanciful film ultimately failed to engage me since it was not about any perception of reality that I could relate to. The world of Amelie has no politics. It has no issues. It only has an exaggerated sense of quirkiness and a pea-(...)The film's suggestion that maturity is founded on cynicism is ludicrous and worthy of a Robin Williams movie or Pay it Forward (which at least had Helen Hunt's acting -- Tautou is overdirected and barely gets to deliver more than two consecutive lines here). Amelie, which feels much more similar in tone and style to Hollywood productions than most French ones, isn't far from Williams' tearjerkers in terms of quality.	1.0	I don't see the reason for the fuss...	2001-11-10	134	43	91

B0000640VO	Amelie	A14ACG78NYFWKG	Jesper Mikkelsen	"have just returned from seeing this movie  for the third time at my local cinema, and it is just as good as the first time.Despite the fact that i have always had a liking for horrormovies and that sort, this has turned out to be the best movie experience i have ever had, and it is definetely NOT a horrormovie. It is the wonderful tale of a young girls struggle to make other people happy and thereby making herself happy. Should you think that this sounds really boring, then let me tell you that in the hands of any other director than Jeunet it probably would be, but he manages to make it into not only a fantastic story but an audio-visual experience beyond anything i have seen in a long time.Not only is the story funny, charming and welltold, but the technical side of it all is also topnotch. The actors, especially Audrey Tautou(Amelie), the rest of the cast, the director Jeunet and the rest of the crew behind this film, has simply given themselves 110 procent. There is simply not one weak link in this movie.So if you are looking for a movie to cheer you up, or if you are just looking for something a little different than the usual hollywood-run of the mill, then give this great movie a chance. I promise you it is better than alcohol, drugs and pills, at least it put a big smile on my lips all of the times that i  have seen it!PS. And if you can stop from falling helplessly in love love with Amelie then you must surely have a hard of stone or a very bad taste in women!PSS. Dont be fooled by the fact that Jeunet also made ...Alien 4, he has made a gigantic comeback here with Amelie.By the way while youre here, buy a copy of his two earlier french films ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of the lost children"", although they are not quite as good as Amelie, they are still very entertaining."	5.0	A film to put a smile on your lips!!	2002-07-30	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1BXLQ281OCT9N	Jessica A. Miller	"Extremely wonderful or beautiful things often leave me struggling for words.  That was how I felt about this movie.  Leaving the theater, I was still completely lost in the world that Jean-Pierre Jeunet created.  Why would I want to leave when everything was so perfect and silly and beautiful there?  It's been a while since a movie has made me feel so good about the world and life in general.  This movie did that because of its simple beauty and strangeness, and I left the theater with a sense of gratitude.  I am not ashamed to admit that I love (need?) a happy ending every once in a while.There were two narrative techniques which I found especially endearing.  The first was the idea of setting up a scene or event by telling the audience about several completely unrelated and sometimes insignificant things that were happening simultaneously.  The second was introducing the characters by listing a few of their idiosyncratic likes and dislikes.  This was a wonderful and different way to develop the characters-it made me feel strongly for each of them immediately.Amelie is an unabashedly strange girl with an un-self-conscious smile and an amazing imaginary life.  The movie begins with her tragic childhood with self-absorbed, neurotic parents and no friends.  Amelie is forced to rely on her imagination for entertainment, companionship, and other things that a young girl needs in growing up.  However, she raises herself well and becomes a self-sufficient, quirky, good-hearted (if a little socially isolated) 23-year-old.  This is where we meet her next, working as a waitress and following her odd little passions.  A random discovery leads her to try to fix everyone's life around her, both through good deeds and petty vengeances.  Even as she is absorbed in this mission, she is slowly moving toward fixing her own life.  The series of events that fill the middle section of the movie are wild, funny, touching and revealing.I found this movie entirely likable (though I admit to a penchant for quirkiness).  I also found the whole movie visually appealing.  Audrey Tautou is beautiful as Amelie, every scene is full of vivid color and detail, and all the characters have extremely interesting faces and personalities.

You have to sit close to the TV though so you can read all the sub-titles.I think a lot of big budget movies are made with only a single good idea to go on.  This movie has some fifteen good ideas - good solid funny or quirky story ideas - to entertain us.There is, however, some sex here and there, so you have to be careful.  I think it would be just as good a movie without it, but the movie maker goes for some sex gags (and is not shy about showing flesh) even though they are not actually that funny.  Ah well.The actress who plays Amelie is adorable.  She is the centerpiece of the movie, but she has a lot of help making things work.  There are quite a few unique and fun characters coming and going throughout the story.  The little girl who plays Amelie at age 6 opens the movie, and she steals our hearts with her innocence.  My favorite part of the movie is when this 6 year old exacts revenge on her soccer-fan neighbor.But a lot of imagination is used in this movie ... and it is all fun.

But what's more, it appeals to the sarcastic, embittered adult's humor while maintaining such a beautiful childlike innocence of character and plot line. Amelie is a whimsical, quiet girl, who likes to toy with those who are a part of the everyday world that she seems only to watch, never to quite fit in to.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3OB4235TKCL8K	J Lee Harshbarger	The package says &quot;The feel-good movie of the year,&quot; and when I heard the basic plot, how Amelie discovers helping other people, I was expecting a pleasant but serious movie, the touchy-feely kind.  &quot;Aw, isn't that special.&quot;  So I was only mildly interested in it before watching.But it really caught me by surprise.  First of all, I was surprised by how funny it was.  I wasn't expecting it to be funny, but many lines made me bust out laughing.  Second, I was entranced with the beautiful world of the movie, a lovely type of fantasy.  I loved the way Amelie and the &quot;glass bones man&quot; talked about a girl in the painting he was working on when they both knew they were really talking about Amelie.  I loved the magic of the streets of Paris, the deeply interesting variety of characters in the movie, and particularly shy Amelie's charming mannerisms.  Adding to movie is the music which so perfectly fits, solidly contributing to the movie's good feeling, and also the unusual cinematic effects, including the way inanimate objects sometimes briefly came to life.Often after watching a movie on DVD, I like to watch some of the extra material--deleted scenes, movie trailers, etc.  But after watching this movie, I couldn't even imagine destroying the beauty of the fantasy with such stuff.So I watched the extras on a different day.  My favorites in the extras:  1) When the director and cinematographer discuss the use of color; it was enlightening and helped me realize one of the reasons I liked the movie so much.  Their use of color was not something I had noticed consciously while watching the film, but after hearing them discuss their use of color, I understood a part of what made this movie so appealing to me (I love color!).  2) It's called &quot;Fantasies of Audrey Tautou&quot; but really it's outtakes.  But what's amazing is how charming she is even when she's veering off the script.  3) It was interesting to see the original storyboard directly compared with the final result in one scene.Normally I don't watch the interviews with the directors, but I did with this one and found it to be interesting enough.  But I'm not a hard core movie buff; I basically just watch movies and that's it.  I generally don't even know the actors' names (except for really big ones), let alone the directors.For me, the extras are fine as far as DVD extras go, but this movie is such a delightful charming fantasy, the extras take away from that magic.  I'll leave those for the hardcore movie buffs and just watch the lovely story again and again.(By the way, I couldn't decide whether to rate it 4 stars or 5; when in doubt I go the conservative route.

Amelie is not just an ordinary comedy, but the reflection of our desires of freedom, pasion, love and, of course, a little of revenge against whoever deserves it.In the movie, we are witnesses of the adventures of Amelie, since her birth till her quest for true love. We discover magic is also knowing our neigborghs, taking care of the people we are constantly in touch with, as the guy in the store, the old man at the door, etc. And we can also truly enjoy the little things about being alive, by seeing the ways of Amelie taking care of an old boring father, an excentric boss, or a mistery in the photo machines at the central station.The action is as fast as it would be in a thriller flick, but here we are enjoying a comedy. Definitely a great movie to see and to enjoy.	4.0	Reality collides Fantasy in France	2002-08-07	1	1	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A15TGJVTMNH0MW	"J. Moon ""terrapinjer03"""	I am 23 years old, and admittedly quite jaded with life, society, and just about everything about the good ole Earth. I got wind of this movie over New Years, and have since watched it several times, always with different people. Not one has been disappointed, so I believe that Amelie is truly a movie that appeals to everyone. For those of you that can't get past subtitles, you probably went and saw the Passion, so you should check this out too. This will contrast that so wonderfully, and probably fill you with a new zest for life.The premise: Amelie is a single waitress that decides to pass on living for herself, and makes an attempt to affect the lives of everyone around her. You might find her meddlesome, but it is never contrived, and normally to a person's benefit. That is until she meets Nino, a pornshop clerk, who has a weird habit of collecting torn photographs from beneath photo booths, and reforming them in albums (I realize that sentence has horrid grammar, but I'm typing faster than I think). This romance is what got me. IF there is something so innocent and pure as the chase depicted here, then perhaps humanity is not all bad. At first, it might seem a tad obsessive, but when placed within the quirkiness and oddities of the characters within the movie, it seems completely normal.I took many things from this movie. Aside from some profound discussion with my friends after seeing it, I got a newfound desire to actually give people a chance. In addition, I also got a rather insatiable appetite for Audrey Tautou, whose childlike innocence, alabaster skin, and melodic voice is something to behold. This is probably the best film made within my lifetime; not because of special effects or cinematography, but because it tells a wonderful story in a wonderful way. You should see it, it's only $4 or so.	5.0	A breath of Fresh Air	2004-05-13	4	2	2

Amelie is about a young girl (Audrey Tautou) who's key to life is by making others see the beauty that they never can see themselves, here eventful encounters with many unique characters bring her to a romance with a mysterious man who's hobby is collection torn pictures throw in the trash next to photo booths. The movie is so utterly adorable it makes viewers blush with how cute and charming it is, and it doesn't hurt that Audrey Tautou is the cutest actress today complete with her little grin.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AD89XR3O6MKW9	john27	Amelie is nothing short of remarkable.  Words cannot say or speak to the level of emotion that this film conveys.The film is centered around a young woman who, in her childhood, experienced almost no physical or emotional contact.  Upon discovering a hidden treasure of someone else's young memories, Amelie had found her epiphany and unlocked her meaning in life: to bring joy to others.However, Amelie's route to doing so must be at her own expense.  She cannot know the joy of someone expressing emotion to her, she had the past to keep that from happening.  She must effect joy on those from a distance, bringing a cornucopia of amusing and elaborately plotted situations that were remotely devised without anyone discovering her.  However, when given her own chance for happeniness, when discovering that the man she loves wants to know her, she is unable to do it.Here, the film shows a young woman with tremendous heart, yet tremendous anxiety.  This heroine also has the ability to touch the heart of the viewer.  Yes, through the magic of television, she makes the viewer cheer for her as she cheers for others.  The film is pure genius.  Bravo!	5.0	Inspirational	2002-11-11	4	3	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	AGCBE06XCLLM9	john b	Amelie is the Hello Kitty of movies. You've seen it in passing. You've given it a glance. You've thought 'geez, that looks kinda...' and you never in any of those times came up with a good enough word to describe what it actually is. Is the word 'sweet'? Is the word 'sappy'? Is the word 'stupid'? Most of all, you're pretty sure that you're just going to hate it- after all, who can pack so much attitude into one little box and still have it come out as something you can respect?If you can get past your initial misgivings about the cute-sy factor of the lead actress (and those big, glowing eyes) then you're in for a real treat. The word you were looking for to describe how you might feel about this movie is going to be none of those I mentioned...instead, you might walk away and think 'sure-fire' or 'sha-zam!' or 'crap, I can't believe this movie made me think of those words...I never use those words!'But they're very much applicable in this case. The story, the acting, the direction, the visuals...they all zing along at their own pace; it's a tempo just shy of break-neck and right above average. The visuals blend with that tempo, creating a whole storyboard that makes us feel as though we are on some wild roller-coaster ride that we didn't really ask to be on but can't help but be grateful for all the same.All of the actors commit themselves to being the characters that they have come to play for the audience and each of them own their roles. When Mathieu Kassovitz's character is first seen digging under the photo booth, we never think 'what a weirdo' but instead find ourselves kind of drawn into thinking 'who is this strange man?'...lured into thinking it by the simple acceptance of the title character. Amelie is a unique young lady whose view of the world sets the stage for the entire movie; where some characters might annoy the audience in other movies, Amelie's acceptance and view of them make them real people who have real problems who really need saving.That's what makes this movie so endearing, that it's a super hero movie without a super hero about real people with real problems stuck in their own real hell who are all saved by a person who probably could not ever exist. Amelie rushes from person to person, a preternatural understanding of the way they work and how to solve their problems guiding her through the whole movie, ricocheting from adventure to adventure, saving countless lives in a webbed intricacy that leaves us dizzy and dazzled...and again, what makes that work is our own need to be saved in our own real lives, in our own real hell, in our own...you get the picture.But where it might become bogged down in taking itself too seriously with it's save-the-world attitude, the movie instead turns cute, cloaking it's external functions with jokes and winks that make us wonder if it's trying to be dirty or if we're just stuffy conservatives. When Amelie wonders to herself 'How many people are having orgasms right now?' that question is answered in a spectacular montage that is primed by Audrey Tautou's sheepish smile at the end of it. '15' she whispers to the camera. It's this sort of thing that makes the movie not only bearable, but also exquisitely delightful to watch.Bottom Line: there is a special DVD set out now that has this movie in it; you can find it at any local Walmart...my advice is to go out and buy it because it needs to be a permanent part of your collection.-LPThe PS Warning: this movie is NOT IN ENGLISH! For those of you who didn't already know that I did not want to be misleading by suggesting that Amelie actually said the word '15'. But! But! It is still 100% worth your viewing time.	5.0	The Hello Kitty Movie	2005-08-29	3	2	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A23OB9FM3MUYXT	John du Prey	"Le sfumature di amore, la passione e l'intimit&agrave; raggiungono il loro culmine nell'il classico di ""idillio puro"" ""Le Fabuleux Destin Poulain (alias"" La Destiny Favolosa di Am&eacute;lie Poulain"") ed il suo ora famoso 'cinematografico & poetico' la colonna sonora da Yann Tiersen. L'umore e la sfumatura presiedono la nostra storia epifania-caricato come i guanti di seta. Siamo subito sbalorditi dalla delicatezza del nostro Am&eacute;lie di eroina (giocato brillantemente da Audrey Tautouand). Diventiamo incantato in questo film attraverso il suo mescolare poetico delle emozioni. La nostra eroina ci disegna nel suo mondo. S&igrave;, potrebbe essere una cameriera timida ma &egrave; anche un vero mezzano, che vede delle opportunit&agrave; di aiutare il nostro Cupido immaginario furtivamente tocco su quei cuori umani dentro il suo piccolo mondo. Am&eacute;lie lo presenta di noi attraverso la sua persona perfettamente piacevole ed affascinante con una con veduta senza pretese ma sincera di come la felicit&agrave; - come uno stato di essere - potrebbe essere trovato.La sua calma diventa il nostro nettare empatico: poich&eacute; sorseggiamo la ciliegia emotiva versata dalla sua prestazione in un bicchiere di Montmartre. I suoi occhi di zaffiro, il movimento e la forma riempiono la nostra immaginazione con un senso dell'anima femminile stendendo la mano sperimentalmente per l'adempimento romantico: tutto il mentre cercando - come se era un lei-angelo altruista - di aiutare quelli intorno a lei nella loro carriera di d&eacute;nouement dell'amore nelle loro proprie vite. Am&eacute;lie fa questo prima che completi il suo proprio movimento di sonata in III di Atto, la Scena 3 mentre ""La i giochi di Valse"" nello sfondo. La sua intuizione ci impegna cos&igrave; profondamente: sentiamo un vincolo con lei. Il suo amore ed il suo interesse per gli altri toccano abbastanza. &Egrave; completamente onorevole e sincera in tutto fa. Non un'oncia di malizia o l'insincerit&agrave; pu&ograve; essere trovata in lei, e rispettiamo il suo carattere anche mentre presenta la bellezza di tutti i giorni e la grazia a noi, come il suo molto proprio pubblico prigioniero.Il tre di doit di femme di Une degno di onore diventa un bel tema dentro la nostra trama: quale nel giro consente che noi attendere sulla decisione dell'Am&eacute;lie di cercare il contatto con il suo amante futuro, Nino Quincampoix (ha giocato con la mascolinit&agrave; elusiva da Mathieu Kassovitz). Diretto da Jean-Pierre Jeunet; scritto da Jeunet con Guillaume Laurant; raccontato da Andr&eacute; Dussollier; la cinematografia da Bruno Delbonnel; e redigendo da Jeffery Schneid. Tutte le unit&agrave; hanno aderito a. Pieno all'orlo con le ironie drammatiche e comico a parte. Ha un apice superiore che comincia quando Am&eacute;lie &egrave; ancora bambino e le fini quando diventa una donna matura che trova o ottiene attraverso la sua propria scaltrezza - l'uomo dei suoi sogni. Forse, le interruzioni intime e sensuali - che colpisce ci poich&eacute; un pubblico che piace un pezzo davvero elusivo romantico - e (poi) ci incoraggia a riprendere delle memorie belle e li rivive nei nostri pensieri e le nostre azioni. Porta la grand'abilit&agrave; a rendere che il momento in tempo - come squisito e puro. Questo film cattura quei momenti originari con la passione elusiva e grezza. Vediamo delle coppie che fanno l'amore. Li sentiamo anche esprimendo il loro piacere mentre alle prese con la passione.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A24R1NURWYCW4T	"""johnny-the-boy"""	Usually when people think pompous movies they think of some rehash of a rehash of a Ingmar Bergman movie that slugs its way through the college film school circuit.  Low angles, black and white, abstract, etc.  (Hold on, I'm getting to my point) And what separates this stuff from the masters?  These young turks confuse their childish self-obsession with actually meaning something.Of course anyone with a brain knows when they see a good piece of film and when they see a bunch of second rate irony in clove cigarette smoke.But then what if these same people decided to say &quot;Wait!  Let's make something sooo precocious it'll make your eyes water!&quot;  And that is what Jeunet did with Amelie.  Now I'm a huge fan of his work up until this point:  Delicatessen was excellent, so was City of Lost Children.  Geez, I even like Aliens Ressurection (try to find five other people who do)!But I can't bring myself to like Amelie because it is so self-aware of its own cuteness.  You can almost hear them behind the camera giving each other high fives on how they saccharin this film is.  The entire point of Amelie's life seems to be &quot;I know people are watching me, and I know they know I know they are watching so watch how cute and adorable I can bat my big puppy dog eyes!&quot;Usually this happens with children actors in movies.  Sometimes you have the Haley Joel Osment of Sixth Sense: endearing because of his unmanufactured charm.  Sometimes you get the Haley Joel Osment of Pay it Forward: nauseating because of everyone trying to cash in on his brand name.  It is the difference between a hand written valentine and something from Hallmark.Delicatessen had it.  So did City of Lost Children.  Amelie doesn't.  See the first two.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A21Z4IVGGR7ZJ5	JOHN P. HANSSEN	"I know she is just a fictional character, but I have to say that I absolutely fell in love with the person of Amelie, yet not necessarily in the romantic sense.  One cannot help, at the very least, finding someone like Amelie very likable.  The expressions she gets on her face alone  would make even the hardest of hearts melt.  I have always found it a great joy in my own life to come across someone who truly inspires you and makes you feel rejuvenated like the elderly men of the film ""Cocoon"" after they went swimming in the aliens' ""Fountain of Youth"".  Amelie is such a person.  When you feel old and ancient, she can make you feel young and refreshed and ready to take on the world.I particularly enjoyed how well this film dealt with her awakening to the fact that the greatest joy can be found in helping others and reaching out in order to touch people's lives in such a positive way.  Perhaps my favorite scene of all is when she takes the lonely blind man by the hand and guides him down the street, explaining everything that is going amid the French hussle and bussle of town.  Just that one act alone was enough to make that poor man's day and it is probably something that he would cherish for the rest of his life.Also, after viewing this film, it made me think of a certain personal development guru by the name of Bill Reidler I heard on a cassette not to long ago and how he talked about focusing on ""Interest Out""--where you make it your entire goal in life to focus your interest outward towards others and not focusing so much on yourself.  I think that Mr. Reidler would really enjoy ""Amelie"", in that it demonstrates ""Interest Out"" to the max.In conclusion I have to say that, if I was a father, I would be very proud to have a daughter like Amelie.  One who visits me every weekend (even if I were a little nutty like her father in the film and tinkering with a giant garden gnome) and shows me genuine respect--just as I would show her, and not just shoving me into a retirement home when I got old.  I would also be proud of the fact that she spent her life doing the best to rectify the lives of others which would give me bragging rights that I think would be quite justified.""Amelie"" is much more than a cute, romantic comedy.  It is a film that offers valuable life lessons, that, unfortunatly, are not often respected in today's selfish society."	5.0	Amelie is a character who will definitely inspire you!!	2007-12-11	4	4	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2686OL78RWG30	Jonathan Mantle	Nietzsche looked to Wagner and Heidegger to Holderlein believing that artistic creations could set the new paradigms for the blossoming of human life. 'Enabling Myths' was Nietzsche's term. The trouble was that they both grew disillusioned with their artistic Gods; the Wagnerian insistence that love mattered more than power was really annoying for Nietzsche; whilst Holderlein's German nationalism seemed a little unfitting in the aftermath of WW2. The point that I'm rather stupidly stimbling towards is thatin 'Amelie' Jeunet has created the most perfect story on which to build a life. It is the ultimate rebuttal of the hideously simple cynicism for which people have such an ugly love. It is fantastic in both the popular sense (as in 'WOW! That was fantastic!') and the true sense (as in being some sort of fantasy) however the magic which it undoubtedly contains is so absolutely grounded in humanity that it can't be talked away as metaphysical nonsense.The message is clear: its alright to be nonconformist; and simple kindness makes the world a better brighter place. I'm sure that some people will blush at the term non-conformist as it stirs up awful thoughts of dire little children who think that they're tearing down the system by dressing up as Marilyn Mansun(son?) There are, however, two types of nonconformist; those that do it for style, for whom it is a pretence, who break from conformity in the same way that everybody else does, who indulge in the apotheosis of Marilyn What's-His-Name; and those who find their own reason and happiness in their own way, who don't follow but generally just wander, those who are in some sense truly alive and free. 'Amelie' is about the latter group. 'Amelie' is about the redemption of happiness and kindness from the curse of world weary cynicism. Albert Camus said the true meaning of life lay in doing good for others, a brilliant message which echoes through this film. Watch it and fall in love with the world.	5.0	Amelie	2002-04-19	11	7	4

Though this film has many special effects and an interesting directing style, it is the acting, the writing, and the solid direction that make it a classic. I especially enjoyed the character writing for the characters at the cafe where Amelie works! The techniques and especially the unconventional special effects that the director use may remind you of &quot;Moulin Rounge&quot;. Not only do we see Amelie and her life, we see her mind too thru floating images of Amelie's thoughts that hover on the side of the screen. At first, I was afraid the director would overuse these techniques. Hapily, these images always had purpose in showing the impish nature of Amelie, and always made me laugh!This movie was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone.

B0000640VO	Amelie	ADA0YN97AVDUK	"""jonsarkpk"""	Amelie is a French comedy that recently caused a small stir in the U.S. It's quite a bit different than your standard fair, but is a pleasing, enjoyable movie to watch. The film follows the main character, starting with a graphic birth scene, and transposing us to her adulthood as she begins a quest to find company and a place in the world. Much of the films feel-good appeal comes from Amelie's clever tricks and gags, including a home-alone like stint in an angry grocers home. The films visuals are nice, with some beautiful shots, and the sound track is excellent as well. Amelie's gently plot and lack of much conflict may not appeal to some viewers, but provides a nice relaxing movie. I wouldn't recommend watching it with the kids though, it's rated R for excessive amounts of sexuality.	4.0	Different but Good	2002-07-22	3	1	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	AMELIE is a quirky and immensely fun French-language film with winsome Audrey Tautou in the title role. With close-cropped hair, and huge brown eyes and mischievous smile in a waif-like face, this Audrey reminds us of another of that name, the delicate and exquisite Audrey Hepburn. If Tautou learns English, she could become a major star in the perception of American cinema audiences.AMELIE grew up socially and tactilely deprived. Her father, a physician, only touched his daughter during her annual physical. She was so thrilled at this rare contact that her heart beat quickly. Diagnosing AMELIE with a congenital heart anomaly, her father kept her out of school. Thus, she was tutored at home and had no friends. Her mother died when the girl was young in a capricious accident involving a distraught tourist and the cathedral of Notre Dame. AMELIE is now a shy, emotionally isolated, and awkward young woman working in a corner bistro.One day, by a freak of circumstance, AMELIE discovers an old, metal box hidden behind a wall tile in her apartment. It contains the boyhood treasures of someone who is perhaps now past 40. Tracking the man down and anonymously restoring to him his childhood memories causes him immense happiness. Gratified by her success, AMELIE decides to enrich the lives of others. Her schemes are quite intricate, and all are undertaken without the knowledge of the beneficiary - one is even her father.  Along the way, AMELIE discovers the possibility of love, and she pursues the young man with a stratagem just as delightfully elaborate as her other contrivances.This whimsical film captivates for several reasons. The characters in Amelie's Parisian world are mildly eccentric (though, after further thought, perhaps really quite &quot;normal&quot;). The director has an offbeat sense of humor, as is revealed in the particulars of the Notre Dame tragedy, and when AMELIE wonders how many orgasms are happening in Paris at a particular moment. Then there's the one scene when AMELIE turns into water. And best of all, there's AMELIE herself. When she looks directly at the camera with her impish smile, one imagines that she's thinking, &quot;I know a tasty secret, and am willing to share it with you.&quot;I hope Audrey Tautou becomes a regular on the American silver screen. I think I'm in love.	5.0	An entrancing performance reminiscent of another Audrey	2001-12-03	5	4	1

I don't cry very often, and I'm not overly sappy, its just that good.  My favorite movies used to be Fight Club, American Beauty and The Fifth Element, and now things have changed.  Amelie was so nicely made it is hard to immagine not loving it.  The cinemotography is top notch and inventive.  The story is sweet and relatable while remaining charming and funny throughout.  Audrey Tautou is painfully cute.  This DVD seems to be the perfect showcase for the movie, the box looks gorgeous and the features blow me away based on description.  In order for this to not be worth buying it would have to be a terrible DVD transfer that skips or something, which would be criminal.	5.0	Greatness in a Cute Green Box	2002-04-17	4	3	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1PGRDOLPXIVB6	"JPMDallas77 ""JP"""	A truly wonderful film. Throughout the opening sequence, in which the cast of unique characters is introduced, I laughed at the originality of their character traits.  Within two minutes, you feel as if you truly know everyone in the film as a close friend.  This closeness makes the rest of the surprisingly long film fly by.  At least a half-dozen sub-plots, (really just amusing anecdotes acted out), provide laughter and poignancy to the film.  At the end you are happy for Amelie as she finds love, and happy for having spent two hours with such a pleasing film.  The enchanting, fairy-tale music will be in your head afterward, and the next day as you think of the film, a smile will come across your face.	4.0	Smiles and Laughter	2002-08-12	5	4	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	We are now entering a great age of movie making.  Computer-generated special effects have become so accessible that even European Cinema can afford them.  Since the good people in Hollywood can't write a decent script to save their lives, and can not imagine a use for CGI other than blowing things up, we must now look elsewhere for our films.  Amelie is just a fun movie - a sweet romantic comedy from beginning to end.  In this film, the special effects act as surreal compliments to the story - more Jean Cocteau than Jerry Bruckheimer.  In the scene where Amelie gets her heart broken, she simply melts into water.  The story, such as it is, basically concerns her fear of meeting the man she has a crush on from afar...or maybe it's about the things a woman does to amuse herself if she's never had a fulfilling sexual encounter?  (How many couples ARE having sex right now?  Only 15?)  It's not really about the plot - it's simply a fun, good-hearted adventure with a lot of quirky people.	4.0	Nouvelle CGI Vague	2002-02-04	7	4	3

The story is a little bit nonsense, but it is funny, specially the part about the garden dwarf. Although we can't say the acting is terrific, the photography makes up to creat a visually spectacular movie.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2QP1PWPGJU2ST	J. Sanford	"Let me make something perfectly clear right from the start. Amelie is not a comedy. Amelie is not a romance movie. Amelie is nothing less than a work of fine art! Amelie is certainly not a romantic comedy and if you set out to judge it by these standards you are apt to be disappointed. Also bear in mind that like a classical symphony, it must be experienced several times before this wonderful movie can be fully appreciated.I first heard the word, ""Amelie"" on a pay-per-view ad, the first thing I thought of was a brand of motor oil from the fifties. (Maybe spelled Amalie?),  ""Well"", I thought, ""any girl named after a brand of engine oil is worth checking out"". Then when I saw the teaser on TV I thought; ""Any movie that features a black-haired, doe-eyed pixie and an animated pig-lamp must be worth seeing"".I expected a light entertainment, a bit-o-fluff romantic comedy, and thats exactly what I saw. But deep in my soul I began to sense something else. So I watched it again and a whole new world began to reveal itself. then somewhere around the fifth viewing it hit me; This is cinematic magic! A symphonic dream of light, sound and love brought to life for all to see. Yes, it took five viewings before it got through my hard shell of cynicism. I am so glad it did!Amelie lives in a beautiful fantasy world where streets are clean and uncongested. A world where waitresses and store clerks find happiness and love. Where bad guys get there comeuppance and not a single drop of blood is spilled. For anyone who grew up lonely, got picked on but never picked for the team, those who would never be a cheerleader or have a chance to date one, this movie tells your story. The entire film is populated with also-rans. Lame bartenders, failed writers, hypochondriacs. People like we meet everyday in the grim, soul crushing, ultraviolet stained world of reality. But these lucky souls live in a beautiful, green and orange colored world where hope still lives and dreams still come true.After a long, hard, day at work, when I've dodged all the angry and bitter people on the freeway and performed all the daily chores that let me keep resident on earth for yet another day, then its time. I take off my shoes, relax and enter Amelie's little world. Soon I feel the anger and depression slip away and for a while, life is worth living again.Maybe this movie should be prescribed as therapy."	5.0	A fabulous movie of destiny!	2002-10-27	12	12	0

Actess Audrey Tautou is delightful as the effervescent Amelie, projecting an Audrey Hepburn radiance but with far fewer inhibitions. You really have to love Paris to keep up with the wierd plot. Nevertheless, sticking it out is worth the time spent becasue the ending brings all that comes before it into bright focus. This fun movie also helped me to brush up on my French language skills, even though, I cheated and used the English sub-titles offered on the DVD. This film probably would not have worked with just any city backdrop, but in Paris, almost anything is believable.  Good characters, strange plot, but Amelie fixes it all for the good, making this interesting viewing.	4.0	Paris Makes Amelie Fun and Visa Versa	2003-05-04	1	0	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A28GCEHD00JFZG	Julian Kennedy	Amelie: (Le fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain): 6 out of 10: Sweet, light and sometimes a little irritating; this strangely adult fable starts out very strong and sinks under the weight of it's too cute for words protagonist and her self made predicament. Amelie is a strange bird indeed. She seems initially one of those wonderfully original creations but as time in the movie marches on it becomes obvious. She is a twelve-year-old girl in a woman's body.Yup she has silly crushes plays silly pranks and a vivid imagination. In fact one could very much see her being played by a twelve year old. This would work perfectly if the movie wasn't so jarringly adult in other ways. (Amelie's quest works in a porn shop, people having hook-up sex in a daytime caf&eacute;)It is more of a tone issue than any objection to adult content. (As a glance at most of my other reviews will testify.) Also like most twelve-year olds Amelie pulls pranks and games a little too long. (After the 2-hour mark or so I was practically screaming at the screen to get on with it)Now don't get me wrong the first hour or so is one of the most delightful screen experiences. I loved the traveling gnome (which started a fad that lives on today) and liked the obsessive tape recording man in caf&eacute;.It also shows a true fantasy version of Paris like You've You Mail's version of New York. In fact when Amelie is helping others rather than on her own quest the movie seems to move briskly and with purpose.It is only in her pursuit of love that Amelie fails as both a person and a movie. Just like most twelve-year-old girls.	3.0	Is Amelie French for Overrated	2010-03-10	6	3	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	AJX0Q5B0QEP57	"Justin Ratcliff ""egovirus"""	"I find it difficult to believe that not one person has written a review for this movie. So I shall try to do my very best. This movie simply oozes charm. I bought it on a lark, and not a few positive words from others. And well, because Audrey Tautou looks cute on the cover. I'd seen a few bits of it here and there, and decided why not. I am glad that I did too, because it's marvelous.This is a quirky movie, and in that way that we Americans will never be able to reproduce. All we do is remake them, and they're typically saccharine sweet at best. We seem to excel at war movies, and depressing stories that crush the spirit of the viewer. And those are good too, but there's only so much one can take before they need a movie like this to soothe their soul. And here we have the French to thank for something other than blowing up a greenpeace ship. Not that I don't whole-heartedly appreciate that.The story is about a girl who spent her childhood starved of affection from her neurotic, but well meaning parents. Mom dies in a bizarre suicide attempt by a Quebec exchange student involving Notre Dame, gravity, and a little bit of screaming. It has almost no bearing on the plot other than to dispose of the mother, and thus add a dimension of grief to the father, who builds her a shrine of odds and ends; to include a (seemingly) nomadic garden gnome. She works at a caf&eacute; with more ""interesting"" people, who have their own little stories, but they are little indeed. She's unlucky in love, thus far, and in life she's so shy that her world consists of working, visiting her bereaved father, and isolating herself in her apartment, where she spies on a curious neighbor who has painted the same Renoir every year for the last twenty years. He also suffers from a genetic condition that predisposes him to suffering broken bones with great ease. Similar to Samuel L's character in that horrible movie Unbreakable, but here it's actually believable.  Everything changes when she hears on the TV that Princess Di has been killed, thus she drops the lid from the bottle in her hand, thus it rolls off and knocks loose a wall tile in her bathroom (how's that for contrived?). Hidden behind is a dust covered rusty tin with some small child's treasures concealed within. She decides to reunite the tin with it's now quite grown up owner, and if she is successful, she will spend the rest of her life trying to reunite other miserable people with some form happiness. It sounds sweet, but only through some small cleverness on the part of the writer can it possibly succeed. Thankfully, it does, begging me to wonder if this movie could possibly ever been made in the States...All of this takes place, and more, with the backdrop of a Paris that does not really exist. The colours are bright, the streets clean, the people amiable. But the photography is outstanding, and helps the movie along in that effortless way we all like to see. Amelie is not all sweet though, as she sees fit to avenge the small crimes of one of the movies myriad of characters. It's all quite harmless, as is the movie, which makes it such a delight to watch. Like eating tiramisu, in a hot bath (I guess). This is definitely a good movie for guys to rent if their lady is coming over, and should yield some form of passion (though I take no responsibility for that comment). Excellent movie for anyone not afraid to read subtitles."	5.0	Tres bien mes amis!	2002-12-09	5	4	1

The bits like the minute details about the characters and their interactions are very humorous.Which brings me to Amelie herself...Audrey Tautou is amazing, simply the most adorably cute actress ever. Her acting is well-done, the expressions and messages she conveys without speech are very eye-opening, close to the silent antics of Keaton or Chaplin.Some might call it overstatement, but this is one of the best films ever. A must-see, especially now when the summer movie period is winding down and you need a break from the mindless action and popcorn movies out there. A must-own.	5.0	Adorable Movie	2002-08-08	1	1	0

One of the greatest things about Amelie is the visuals and the creative images in the film: its simply wonderful to look at.  I found myself spending half the time reading and, unfortunately, missing the visuals.  That was fine for me, as I had already &quot;seen&quot; it, but I don't think my wife got the same pleasure, though she too enjoyed the film.That said, I still highly recommend the film, but think that it may be best enjoyed after multiple viewings, when you know the story and can focus on the wonderful visuals.	4.0	Fantastic Film, DVD could be improved	2002-07-19	1	1	0

I am an adoring fan of Audrey Tatou and will watch anything she stars in. It's a delightful story of real life misfits who fall in love. The characters are so full of life. The cinematography takes you to another world. And there are those little quirky things that makes the film delightfully charming and French. You won't get the same feeling from a Hollywood blockbuster.	5.0	Absolute Fav	2014-05-17	1	1	0

I simply didn't like the type of humor in this movie. I was horrified at the manner in which she 'fit'(didn't would be more accurate) in her family and why she went along the path she did.........and that is all I can say. Not funny, not for children(and almost every parent assumes if it is animated it is a great movie for children) and never need to be watched again.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2GX02L7RZ9TX1	K. Blonde	Am&eacute;lie is a young, independent woman working as a waitress in a caf&eacute; near Sacr&eacute;-Coeur. The secondary characters in the film are charicatures of typical Parisians, but they are the sort of odd mix you might find in any big city. Am&eacute;lie finds herself in the middle of a bit of a mystery one day and that mystery guides the plot towards the ultimate happy ending, true love.There are some detours on the way. Am&eacute;lie reintroduces her father to life with creative use of a garden gnome. She teaches an overbearing shop keeper a lesson on how to treat people, plus a few other entertaining sidetracks. There are good subplots involving the secondary characters as well. All this makes for a very rich and entertaining movie.The film itself is beautiful, Paris doesn't look as good in real life as it does in this movie. The colors are exceptional and the music is charming. If you're a fan of contemporary French movies it has a few recognizable faces from other movies, like Isabelle Nanty, who does a fabulous job as a weird hypochondriac tobbaconist and Mathieu Kassovitz who plays Am&eacute;lie's well-matched love interest.The first time I watched this movie, I wished everyone I knew spoke French because the subtitles do leave a bit to be desired, but I think people are still clever enough to figure out what is going on. Its just a shame to miss the nuances and idiosyncrasies of each character that their manner of speaking reflects. My husband loved it though and his French is just so-so.If you are open to a well made romantic comedy and speak French or don't mind reading sub-titles, I highly recommend this movie.	5.0	A great date-night movie!	2004-11-01	5	3	2

In visually playful style, it tells the story (in French, with subtitles) of a dreamy, lonely woman who seeks to help the other oddballs she is acquainted with to find love and joy, but has a hard time helping herself. The cinematography is delightful and the the characters are amusing, although I did feel that the movie was a little self-conscious in giving each one of them an absurd eccentricity (copying the same Renoir over and over, collecting photo booth rejects, etc.) I also felt that although the film had a happy ending for some of the characters, it left a lot of the other ones hanging. A friend told me that was more realistic than resolving everything, but there is nothing realistic about this film, either in style or content. Fans of this French director will think this his finest, most accessible work. Newcomers will enjoy the weird whimsy of this colorful thing, if they can stand to look at Amelie's face smirking on the film advertisements.	4.0	Fun	2002-01-07	4	1	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3B778KOUKM18B	ken powers	"This review is to help young gentlemen such as myself.  Through the viewing of this film I have experienced no small amount of pain and, in these trying times, I feel it is my duty to save my fellow brethren from such a fate.  My suggestion... stay away from this life sucker.  This is a chick flick about a self-obsessed high maintenance hoochie-mama.  If it was starring Julia Roberts and was set in New York, you wouldn't touch it with a ten foot loaf of French bread.  Don't let the art house cloak fool you, this film will cause you pain.  It seems there are many people out there who enjoy watching this character run around for 2+ hours (in France) acting real cute, hence the stack of good reviews.  Hell, even I was curious.  But to me it felt like 5 hours of, albeit beautifully shot, trite French torture.  Some women will implore you to see this film.  Ignore them!  You may also want to carefully examine said women, as they probably feel akin to the heroin, and trust me, having a space cadet like Amelie in your life could only cause you harm in the long run.  If a man (or dude, depending on were you come from) recommends this film, slowly back out of the room so as not to arouse suspicion.  Once extricated from this potentially dangerous situation, run to the nearest phone an report him to the FBI.  My understanding is that they're keeping a list of these people ""just incase""."	2.0	Wait for the US remake, and then don't see that one either	2002-07-19	33	14	19

A delightful comedy, to be sure, but embodied in the quest for romance by it's two quirky heroes are many themes that touch us all as humans. Not only are there numerous subplots involving many colorful characters, but just the right amount of surreal and fantasy. The acting ropes you in to believing in all of them as players in a reality that is somehow familiar. I'm not done watching this one.	5.0	Sublimely Wonderful Movie	2014-05-13	1	1	0

(Widescreen Edition).AMELIE,for me,was a study in stylistic frustration.The story of the young and terribly shy woman who has great difficulty touching the outside world is actually quite innovative and infectious,but I caution anyone who enjoys scenes that linger.Nothing about AMELIE lingers.There is virtually no scene that lasts beyond a five second interval with some kind of an edit.The camera angles are either above,below,sideways or right in your face.If I had been a set dresser on this filmed I would have been PO'd that my detailed work was never allowed to be seen.This is my personal opinion.Stylistically,AMELIE is not a film I would ever watch a second time.It is full of magically vivid colours and characters,but the director Jeunet's style did not lend itself to telling a story as much as the style triumphed the substance for me.A solid one time view.	3.0	AMELIE in a million and one pieces	2008-01-21	3	0	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3GJUCDUNWPEG0	kevin yee	I see there are many many reviews for this film, and Ive only seen it once but I was totally blown away by it, and I would urge anyone and everyone to give this movie a try. Subtitles can ..., I know, but this movie is so good it makes up for them. I hope I don't reveal too much of the film with this review, either, so if you haven't watched it, why are you reading this, go and get it!For those still reading, the first thing I noticed was the interesting cinematography, from the sped up shot of Amelie's mother's gestation (which was odd but cool), and the shots of our heroine's Montmarte (I think) environment. The film presents interesting camera angles, which work well with the suspense element, as well as showing the conflicting emotions presented throughout the film. Amelie's world is made up of vibrant colors, which fit snugly with her bubbly personality, and provide a nice contrast when she dresses in dark colors and since she has dark hair. Speaking of Amelie...Audrey Tautou, never heard of her before, but I instantly fell in love with her after watching this film. The writers and directors did an excellent job of creating her character, with her heart melting shyness, intruging alone time, and her elaborate strategies, but I think the actress stole the show hands down. She did a flawless job of portraying her character, has that sweet little girl voice, and is so cute (pranking the phone repair people, in the theater, returning the book to the porn shop, the list goes on...) that I cant help myself. The other characters were definitely secondary, as many seemed one dimensional even though they had different emotions, but they are all well acted and each have their own unique placement in Amelie's life and times.This movie had an uncanny ability to totally draw me in. I missed I think 2 phone calls while watching it, and totally lost track of time. I was cheering for Amelie during her two excursions, and vocalized my angst and sorrow when they didn't work out, much to the bewilderment of my family, who was home at the same time but not watching the film. With that said, you can probably imagine my reaction at the end.I would rank this movie somewhere in my top 10 of all time, and it's the first real 'feel good' movie that really made me feel good for more than an hour after its conclusion. Everyone at my school and my work has been told to watch it, and now I am telling you to, as well. It's lovely, a truly astonishing piece of film.

She helps total strangers and ends up helping herself. An amazing story with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer thinking. The humor is subtle and you end up cheering for the heroine. The subtitles are not an totally accurate translation; however, the missing words and phrases do not detract from the wonderful storyline and the fully rounded characters. Amelie is a movie you can watch over and over again-each time seeing a slightly different movie by following the differing storylines of the individual characters.	5.0	Amelie - a look at connectedness	2013-08-27	0	0	0

Gradually, however, she starts meddling in the lives of her neighbors and co-workers and finds that she loves doing it. She becomes fascinated by a man who collects discarded instant-photos in the train station and, with the use of some clever photos of herself, they fall love.The thing that makes Amalie so utterly irresistible is the script: Amalie talks directly to the audience and shares her candid thoughts throughout the movie. She is funny and clever. The star, Audrey Tatou, reminds you instantly of Audrey Hepburn. She is petite, perky, and has her own style. She is simply adorable.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2J4D92KNPO0CK	Kyle Parker	I had heard alot about this movie from all the chatter just buzzing around, not to mention the really high ratings it recieved on imdb and ymdb.com. The subtitles are really nothing bad, and you get use to them in a minute. But About the movie, The movie tells the story of Amelie a girl working in a coffee shop in France. Now the depection of France is nothing like real day France, but the fictional aura of it and how beautiful everything looks is really breathtaking. Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a fabulous display of colors mixing with that slight french carnival music playing at the appropriate times. Audrey Tautou (and her amazingly cute self) couldn't have been a better suite for the title role. Her display of facial expressions and cute top lip make this movie. As the story progresses Amelie finds a box containing memory's of a man's child hood. And she secretly returns it to him, enlightening his life. Here, she devote herself to helping people. Through her adventure we meet Ramond DuFayel her painter friend who asks her about her life through his painting of a crowd, her being the faceless girl. Lucien, the slightly slow fruit salesmen who wants to be an artist and is harassed by his boss about it. And Amelie's father Raphael who she is trying to convince to get out and travel but he would rather stay home with his garden gnome. But in reality Amelie gets so caught up in helping others, that she forgets to help herself. That might sound kinda heavy hearted, but this story of adventure, &quot;stratagems&quot; and love couldn't be any more lighthearted. And in the end it just left me with a big smile, making me feel better than ever and brightening the day. The DVD is two disc's and loaded with extra's but I was to engulfed in the movie to even worry about them. Maybe not the greatest movie ever made, but proabably the most fun and most entertaining movie I've ever watched.	5.0	That Top Lip	2004-02-21	6	4	2

Drawing from memorable characters, a well-told story, and the unforseen magic that becomes the essence of life, ""Amelie"" is a savory cinematic joy!Amelie is an atypical girl living a typical life. She loves the little details and magic in life the most, like cracking creme boulea' with a spoon, and watching peoples' faces in the dark of a movie theater. When she finds a rusty tin box hidden behind a tile in her bathroom filled with lost treasures of childhood, Amelie sets out to find its owner which sparks a series of events in which Amerlie becomes a ""do-gooder"" to those who deserve it, and a ""bad-dooer"" to those who've earned it. Eventually, Amelie must also face her own personal wishes and desires or loose them forever.We are enthralled, we're entertained, we laugh, we smile, and by the end of the film, we learn to ever-important lesson that making yourself happy in life is the next best thing when helping others appreciate the magic of life. The current ""seeping in"" of foriegn films into mainstream cinema could not be better represented than by ""Amelie"", a true treasure of foriegn cinema that's bound, not only for Oscar glory, but to capture the hearts of American audiences as well.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"""Am&eacute;lie"" is a film where you want to find the perfect word for describing its charm. There is probably such a word in French, but I would not know what it was. All I know is that quirky, enchanting, and everything I come up with in English is wholy inadequate to the task at hand. The most important thing to know is that ""Am&eacute;lie"" is a film where you should go see it because so many people love it, even if it requires you to not to do anything else so you can read the subtitles (some people resist such demands and--shudder--listen to dubbed versions of ""Life is Beautiful"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""). I feel about this film the way I did about ""Memento,"" where I told people they should see it and refused to tell them anything else because it would ruin the experience (think the Heisenberg principle). However, I think the audience that would enjoy ""Am&eacute;lie"" is considerably wider than those who would cotton to a quirkly little film like ""Memento.""So, I am giving you my strongest recommendation for you to see ""Am&eacute;lie."" Now, if you have not yet seen the film, please go away, because I want to talk to those who have seen the film and while I am not going to be providing what we would traditionally consider ""spoilers,"" you really sure come to view this film as pure and chaste as the driven snow (of which we have lots up here).I find it interesting that the film's French title ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain"" was reduced to just ""Am&eacute;lie"" for American consumption. Combined with the green framed portrait of actress Audrey Tautou smiling impishly as the title character, this certainly does not give viewers a real idea of what they will discover in this film. One of the chief charms of the film for me was how you had to pay attention to the details because almost everything was a clue as to future developments (the exception that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Am&eacute;lie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do. We then begin 48 hours in which d'Am&eacute;lie's life is changed. Of course such massive developments hinge on a bottle cap fallen to the floor. Our heroine's efforts to sabotage the life of Collignon (Urbain Cancelier), the Grocer (who will never be confused with an artichoke), struck my funny bone exceedingly hard and her relationship with the Glass Man, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), was particularly nice, both their discussions about the girl with the wine glass in the Renoir painting and the old man giving her the final push to her destiny. The only question is whether Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), is really good enough for our girl, but if she is smitten with a man who collects torn up and discarded photographs from photo booths around town, who are we to challenge her choice?The end of the fabulous 48 hours at which point our heroine finds her destiny does not offer a perfect world. Some find true bliss in love, others finally go on trips, but some still right where they started, unpublished, afflicted by imaginary illnesses, or consumed by jealousy. But as long as Am&eacute;lie lives happily ever after we are content."	5.0	I pity the person who does not fall in love with this film	2005-04-16	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1IWWRZJOXOSYP	Lee Armstrong	While the characters of Ally McBeal from the television show and Amelie are different and certainly Calista Flockhart & Audrey Tautou are worlds apart, one thing that appealed to me about the tv show also appeals to me about this film.  The expressionistic element is wonderful in Amelie.  Just like we used to see arrows actually flying at McBeal's heart when she was suffering a romantic heartbreak, we see Amelie literally melt into water in this film.  These are great touches.Jeunet carefully planned the film, using storyboards to plan down to the minute details of exact camera angles and film speeds.  The added commentary on the DVD is an eye opener as it is described how the digital imaging now allows for the filmmaker to tint the colors and control the look of the film.  Amelie represents a great technological achievement.The story is touching and carried me along to the end as if the movie passed in an instant.  Just as Jeunet paid great attention to the look of the film, he has cast and shot the supporting characters with detailed attention.  Even Jean Darie who walks across the screen for about a minute as a blind man Amelie whisks through the city describing the city scene is memorable, without uttering a line.  Serge Merlin who played Drefayel the artist with the breakable bones who paints the same Renoir painting each year for the last 2 decades is marvelous and propels Amelie to go for the gusto, so to speak.  Isabelle Nauty as Georgette the tobacconist that Amelie falls in love is wonderfully dense and neurotic.The themes of the picture are also playfully and entertainingly represented.  The innocence of Amelie and Nico is a touchstone for the picture.  This is contrasted by the world around them:  Nico works in a porn shop where Amelie bravely walks in to find him.  And while Amelie does try to make those around her happy, she also metes out justice as she sneaks into the apartment of the cranky grocer and puts foot cream where his tooth paste should be and shorts out an electrical cord sending sparks.Finally, I enjoyed the romance of this picture.  Mathieu Kassovitz is wonderful as the Nino.  The final scene where Amelie wordlessly and tenderly kisses his eyes and neck with him returning the caress so gently was quite beautiful, and reflects the sweetness and innocence at the heart of the film.  I found the picture a complete joy and look forward to revisiting it again.  Bonjour!	5.0	Sparkling:  Ally McBeal in France	2002-07-22	2	0	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1JLEHQDIBJM2Z	Leigh Munro	This a wonderful film.  It is enjoyable on so many levels.  It is loud, it is funny, it is so colourful, it is vibrant, it is very moving.  The first twenty minutes of this film are a masterpiece of film-making - they are also happen to be hilarious.  Audrey Tautou is marvellous as Amelie.  Through a chance discovery she decides she wants to be a do-gooder and to make other people happy.  But she is also very introverted when it comes to her own happiness.  The end of the film is very moving for Amelie realises that making others happy, while gratifying, is not sufficiently fulfilling when she herself has no love in her life.As for DVD extras, the director's commentary is as charming as the movie itself - he is great company and so French with it.

But a co-worker said this was her favorite movie, so I checked it out.  It is better than every movie on the Time list, so far.  Aguirre - The Wrath of God is the only one so far that comes close, but I have quite a few to go.  I've only seen about 10 of them.What I love most about this movie is how sweet and affectionate the ending is.  I am just so tired of seeing passionate sexual kisses on screen.  The kisses here are tender, gentle, loving.Amelie herself is unforgettable and sweet.  There is a wonderful villain in the movie, a grocer, such an obnoxious guy, but fun to watch.  The actor must have had a ball playing him.I like the color in most of the movie.  It is bright and colorful.  I feel like it is painted with the vitality that would be appropriate for a small child's room, bursting with lively colors.There is such a funny, gentle, accepting, pleasant attitude towards sex.  In one scene we see couple after couple in the middle of it.  In another scene we see glasses on shelves, rocking to the beat of a couple having sex.  There is a sex shop, and it isn't ridiculed or made slimy.  It's played for innocent humor, as a female employee pastes price stickers on dildos and a man carelessly sticks them on a shelf - they make a hysterical visual impact.  Anyone who objects to the sex in this movie has a problem.I'm a very tough reviewer, and I usually give the classics, the icons, about 3 stars.

What a pleasant, wonderful surprise!I had read that it was about an overly imaginative young woman, but that's not really accurate. In this movie, Amelie's whole world is hyperimaginative--it's not just her. There is a great narrative train overlaying the movie, as we are informed about certain facts regarding the characters, such as one whose sole pleasure is  bursting bubble wrap, and another who dislikes waking up with her face wrinkled from the pillow case. Through it all, our heroine Amelie tries to arrange the world to provide maximum happiness, without trying to do anything in particular for herself at first, but thank goodness, she winds up pretty happy herself by the end.S'il vous plait, you've just gotta see this move, it'll be ""quelle dommage"" if you don't!"	5.0	Parfait! did I get that right?	2002-03-09	3	2	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1GQAKL9CGQLP1	L. M. Keefer	This is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  If you like movies of transformation, with some quirk and whimsy thrown in for good measure, you should enjoy this film.  It seems totally original to me.  Amelie, played by Audrey Tatou, has been damaged by life's circumstances, and because of her resulting sensitivity she is able to intuit the needs of different people she knows and meets and supply those needs in unique ways.  To sprinkle their lives with a touch of magic and whimsy.  When watching it, you realize that life needs more whimsy and silliness.Audrey Tatou is simply enchanting as Amelie - and yes, she is very Audrey Hepburnish.  It's hard to imagine anyone else playing this central role with the same aplomb and gamine artistry.  The book is more character-centered than plot centered.  If you like linear plots, it will probably frustrate you.  But if you like small intelligently sentimental vignettes, the movie should reach your heart and delight you.  I found it totally charmante and can watch it again and again.  It's a little work of film art.  And how refreshing to have an upbeat film with an affirming message.	5.0	Whimsical & Magical Amelie	2013-08-15	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A6J7GN6ZOR085	lonebeaut	When I was younger, I was addicted to French films.  They were like Chinese food:  one hour later you couldn't remember what you'd just consumed, and you were hungry again.  Being French, they were almost always about love and sex, with all the participants being impossibly handsome/beautiful and well-dressed.  &#34;Amelie&#34; is one of those, but it has a lot of humor and some very eccentric characters, so it's not as one-dimensional as those French films of yore.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3DBHFIZTWHI5I	"Lotus Mystique ""Lotus Mystique"""	Don't be daunted with the prospect of a foreign film because you will miss out on a quirky heroine and her adventures. Amelie warms the heart and delights the senses with a rich story and amazing use of color.I really enjoyed Audrey Tautou's performance in her wide range of expression throughout the story. While the story itself is not overwhelmingly remarkable, Jean-Pierre Jeunet andGuillaume Laurant's way of telling it captures the viewer from the start. Color plays an integral role in this film, rather reminiscent of Technicolor in the early days of film. It's almost hypersaturated but only serves to enrich the tale.To fully appreciate this film, watch it first in French with the subtitles to hear the nuances of the French language. I have also watched it dubbed in English but some of the voice inflections cannot be compared to the original French.This is a very uncharacteristic and whimsical film. Like reviewers before me, I agree that you will either love it or hate it. I highly recommend it!	5.0	Beautiful film	2005-06-23	2	1	1

The direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet is the perfect balance of sound and color. From the very start you are immersed in the world of Amelie, a girl who realizes that there is more to life than what you and me consider important. Through her unconventional selfless acts she manages to better the lives of those around her...but does she have the courage to follow her dreams and better her own life?	5.0	Most beautiful movie I've ever seen...and I've seen plenty!	2003-04-28	6	6	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1TWTULVD6F22O	"L. Quido ""quidrock"""	"....P>I saw Amelie first in the theater, but my real appreciation is for the DVD.  The transfer to DVD is almost legendary, it is done so well.  It helps to start with the magical direction of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who oversaw impeccable camerawork and a script loaded with charm into the film you will see on the DVD.  It was obviously a labor of love, and Jeunet worked nearly as hard on the special features that accompany the film on the 2-disc set.  The audition tapes, the story of the ""home movies"" within the film and the chats with Jeunet and the cast are all captivating.Jeunet successfully uses voiceover as a tool in the film, allowing the viewer to quickly react to the situations encountered by both child and adult Amelie.  He's artistically clever with his music, with flashbacks, and with dream sequence to give you a series of interconnecting events, all leading up to the theme of redemption and the enjoyment of life through the joy you give to others.  In particular, the use of photos, the booby traps for a local grocer with a nasty temper, and the delightful traveling garden gnome are creative and funny.There would be no story without Audrey Tatou, the whimsical actress who embodies Amelie.  Audrey Hepburn at a young age, she is incredibly charming and quirky.  It will be interesting to see if her career takes her beyond this, a signature role.You'll love owning and watching Amelie, it is one of life's small treasures!"	5.0	It's probably silly...	2003-03-25	71	66	5
B0000640VO	Amelie	A25HJ1RTKSDR7M	"LT ""Lawrence Thompson"""	Amelie is the film that defines the genre of magical realism...more specifically, Joyous Magical Realism -- that part of life that borders on, and maybe goes into, the fantastic.  it is not unbelievable, for we all hope to live our lives in that perpetual state of grace and perfection.  Amelie captures this in film.  Audrey Tatou is divine in her role of Amelie, a young French girl working in a cafe who has a moment of clarity, an epiphany so profound and simple that she is able to grasp it and act upon it without hesitation.  Simply put, to make peoples' lives better.  She then embarks upon a series of quests to do just that.  It is these quests that are the joy of the film, but fear not, Amelie is not left out.Let me say that at the end of the film, we share her joy.  I do not recall ever leaving a theater in tears of joy as I did with Amelie.  It is a pity that there are no more than 5 stars to rate this film.

Although I usually like movies to have a bit more of an 'edge' (a film such as Jeux d'Enfants, for example, Yann Samuell 2003 - I consider that to be sort of the perverse counterpart to Amelie), I simply loved this modern fairytale. It has a nice story, beautiful images, with beautiful colours, and one of the best soundtracks I know.

For a long time everyone had been telling me ""Oh, what a wonderful movie!"" and I only thought, ""Yes, well there are LOTS of wonderful movies"". At last I got this one and watched it. It was the most fun I'd had in a while.You're REALLY got to be quick with this movie because it's subtitled and the dialogue is really clever- but also EXTREMELY fast. If you miss anything they're saying you'll be sorry because a moment later you could be in one of Amelie's visions and wonder to yourself ""What's going on?!""The story is of a girl who finds a box full of childrens toys from the fifties hidden in a hole in her bathroom. She comes to a desicion that she will find the owner and give back the box- and if it brings the owner joy then she'll commit herself to doing good deeds. It's full of such wonderful wit- some of it very twisted and at moments so sudden you can't help but laugh in surprise and delight. Alas when Amelie DOES commit herself to a life of good deeds she finds herself searching for the owner of a lost photo album, and begins to fall in love with him (though they've never met)! It's beautifully filmed with stunning imagery and computer graphics, and is all alround inspiring. It makes one want to get up and do what they REALLY want to do in their lives, whether it's travel the world or have a small orgasm in a cafe bathroom."	5.0	If you can't watch movies with subtitles, learn how!	2004-10-14	8	5	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2QKJCQMACNIAC	Maggie	Amelie beautifully depicts what has been missing from American cinema - a romantic comedy in its purest form. A magical, realistic love story that doesn't resort to absurdity, say like Kate & Leopold. Audrey Tautou delivers a luminous performance as the title character. Her performance immediately draws the viewer in. She is supported by a wonderful supporting cast of characters, especially in my mind Lucien the assistant grocer and the younger Amelie. Also keep an eye out for the gnome.This is truly an inspired movie that captures the magic of romantic comedies without force feeding the viewer romance and comedy (think Serendipity). Both the romance and comedy is subtle and wonderfully portrayed. If you've been searching for a well-done romantic comedy, this is it. Though the subtitles may be off-putting to some viewers, this is not a difficult movie to follow. Give it a chance - you will truly be glad you did.A brilliantly acted, well told story that will leave the viewer with a smile on his/her face - Amelie deserves the highest mark. 5 stars.	5.0	A romantic comedy in the purest form	2002-05-27	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A165JPQFQQAF09	Magneto	I have already reviewed Amelie at Amazon's UK site, but that was after only one viewing (at the cinema), but I have now seen it a few more times after buying the (UK) DVD.Needless to say, I still think this film is utterly brilliant. Having now seen Amelie 3 times I'm prepared to say it's definitely my favourite foreign language/subtitled film ever, surpassing previous favourites of mine like Life is beautiful & Cinema Paradiso. More importantly though, Amelie is fast becoming one of my all-time fave movies of ANY kind - regardless of the country of origin.I won't bore you with the story, as you have in excess of 200 other reviews here you can get that from!, but just wanted to say a few points about the movie; Audrey Tautou is simply wonderful in the lead role, the film has a fantastic opening sequence with Amelie as a young girl, it is full of uplifting moments (like when the man finds his childhood treasure box in the phone booth), it is vibrant in colour and has a great visual style, and a superb soundtrack by Yann Tiersen which fits the film perfectly...Amelie is simply a wonderful film that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible, even those that don't normally watch subtitled movies.	5.0	"""Amelie"" review update - World cinema at it's best"	2002-04-25	0	0	0

However the storyline is totally unconventional, filled with her daydreaming depicted in very original and fun ways, and with unexpected turns as she goes about her good deeds. At one point she finds herself caught in pursuing what's best for others, while being afraid to pursue happiness for herself.In times of uncertainty and was such as these, where everyone is in dire need of a positive message, this movie is it.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A8YEVW75LF4QE	Maria Gonzalez	Amelie is an amazing Romantic Comedy that has a little bit of ourselves within it. The protaganist, helpless Amelie played by French Actress Audrey Tautou, has had a life filled with isolation. She is constantly ignored by her father and after leaving home, she is let into the real world. After discovering a toy box buried in her apartment from the 60s, she sets her mind on helping others. The irony is that despite her strong efforts to solve other people's problems, she has trouble solving her own. Her main problem is confronting the man she loves, unfortunately her awkward self makes it impossible to succeed with this task, so she communicates with him in creative and strange ways.The setting of course is France, and the film has a very pleasing green and red tint to it that adds to the magic and emotion.The characters are great and expressing common French Persona.Although this movie is not appropriate for kids*, it will bring out the youth in all of us.

Thinking this is a chick flick, I entered the theatre doubtful. The movie started and I could not take my eyes off it. The star, Audrey Tautou, is absolutely stunning. Her mixture of beauty, brains, and bashfulness make her perfect for the role. Like I said, I'm a high-school guy who is not into the chick flicks, I like the Farrelly bros., John Waters, John Woo, and Kevin Smith. This IS NOT a chick flick, it is for everyone.

Audrey Tatou is so cute as the pixy faced Amelie, who is do gooder for society. She helps couples find love, the depressed to find happiness, the blind to enjoy lifes pleasures through imagination, touch, and smell, and the cruel to get revenge. But not in the way that Uma Thurman gets revenge in Kill Bill Volume 1+2, but in the way that making the villian suffer in an ungruesome but still funny way . Meanwhile, through all this do gooding, she puts her own life on hold. She gets much excitement elsewhere through skimming stones along water, dipping her hand in grain, having bad sexual experiences, tyhinking odd questions like 'how many people are having orgasms at that moment. That is until she meets Nino, that her world comes to a hault, and for the first time she puts herself first, finding out eventually that doing good, means getting good in return, and that her seemingly happy world becomes even more brighter.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A129YBX5BVNW2	"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry"""	"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 BLU-RAY REISSUE ***Jean-Pierre Jeunet's delicious ""Amelie"" wowed many hearts back in 2001 and has remained a warmly remembered favourite ever since. Now in October 2011 (UK) - to celebrate its 10th Anniversary - ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" (its full French title) - finally makes its way onto BLU RAY - and I'm thrilled to say it's a peach.First up - lovers off the film who already own the 2DVD Special Edition set from 2002 - will be glad to see that all of its extras have made the transfer to this Momentum Pictures Blu Ray reissue (see list below). The card-wrap on the outside of the keep case gives it a classy feel (and it's cheap too). But of course the best news is the picture quality, which is rarely anything less than BEAUTIFUL.Some words on this because it's such a huge part of the movie. Jeunet was bitterly disappointed at how his 1991 film ""Delicatessen"" translated to screen - it seemed that none of the work he put in showed on the actual print. He took no chances with the densely populated and complicated ""Amelie"" - it was filmed entirely in digital - which meant that post-production could add or detract whatever he wanted with precision. The film therefore has a very deliberate pallet of colours - particularly GREEN and RED. It gives the whole look a treated feel - almost a glow - but it's exquisite - and subtle too. It's gorgeous to look at and was deliberately rendered to be so. The scene where Amelie walks in the attaching tunnels of the Paris Subway sees the walls look 'lime green' and the effect is beautiful (digitally changed).There are so many great visual moments too - unplugging the aerial of a male neighbour who tricked her as he tries to watch football, her mother examining her puckered fingertips in the bathtub, explaining the sights and sounds of the market as she rushes a blind man down a street, skimming stones on the canal outside her home, her father examining her as a child and mistaking her excitement as a defective murmur (dialogue above), stealing the garden gnome, Blubber the suicidal goldfish, the book of discarded passport photos made by her equally odd male fancy (a wonderfully cast Mathieu Kassovitz) - all are realized and framed with a warmth that fills the entire film. BRUNO DELBONNEL received many nominations for Cinematography and won some too.[Note: The natural default for the print is 2.35:1 - which means lines at the top and bottom of the screen - but even if you stretch it to 16:9 aspect (full screen) - the subtitles are still visible on the bottom of the screen (just about).]Then there's the script. Co-written by the Director and GUILLAUME LAURANT - and told almost entirely in narration - right from the off its quirky, imaginative and on many occasions - ball-breakingly funny (a sex scene in the toilet of the Windmill Caf&eacute; between a jealous patron and hypochondriac woman is fantastically good). Being spoken in French too only adds to ""The Big Lebowski"" madness of it all as random events pepper the story of Amelie - a kindly yet mischievous dreamer who works as a waitress in a Paris cafe. The place is emotional central - peopled by a boss with half a leg and a man who bursts plastic bubbles under his table as he spies on a woman who spurned him.There are two particular scenes of cinematic genius - first is when Amelie finds a tin box of toys hidden behind a tile in her bathroom wall put there by a little boy 40 years back. She then tracks down the now older Dominic Bretodeau (masterful acting by Maurice Benichou) and lures him to a phone booth where he finds this lost treasure. His tears and look of childlike wonder is cinema at its very best. He then talks about it at a bar afterwards with Amelie listening close by. His dialogue is full of heartbreak and wisdom.Second - there's the elderly frail painter Raymond Dufayel (a superb turn by Serge Merlin) who hasn't ventured out of his apartment for decades (nicknamed `The Glass Man' because of his supposed frail bones). Raymond continually paints and repaints a Renoir classic - but never seems to get it just so. A local grocer's boy called Lucien who is belittled by his bully Dad - brings Raymond his groceries and goodies. There is a scene between Lucien (great casting in Jamel Debbouze) and the wiser Raymond where the older observer of life helps the young put-upon boy to vent his rage with humour - it's touching, inspiring and poignant.But the movie belongs to AUDREY TAUTOU who quite effortlessly made millions of men fall in love with her - and pine helplessly for her presence ever since. There's that touch of Audrey Hepburn beauty and class about her - a very rare thing in cinema these days. She could boil an egg and guys would stand there drooling. It was her breakthrough role and rightly so.Rewatching ""Amelie"" on BLU RAY has been a delight - and I'd forgotten how funny, charming and deliciously inventive it is - all the way through.Do yourself a favour and crack-open this Cr&egrave;me Boulez of a film...it has layer after layer of flavour - and I for one loved every soppy calorie-filled minute of it.ASPECT RATIO: 16:9 (Original Aspect Ratio 2.35:1)REGION CODE: BAUDIO: DTS-HD French 5.1SUBTITLES: EnglishEXTRAS:Commentary with Director Jean-Pierre JeunetMaking Of AmelieDirector's InterviewQ&A; with Director and CastThe Look Of Amelie (including interviews with Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Bruno Delbonnel)Audrey Tautou's Funny FacesScreen TestsPhoto GalleryStoryboardsTrailers"	5.0	"""...The Thrill Of This Rare Contact...

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2JDR162ARCHHL	Mark Bendig	After reading the endless rave reviews here I was eager to experience this charming, delightful film. Well, I managed to watch the first hour and fifteen minutes before giving up on it. Yes, it looks beautiful, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I guess I'm a Phillistine or something, but wow, this is one *boring* movie. I dozed off several times and had to rewind the DVD to see if I had missed anything interesting, but I hadn't. Even after over an hour I still didn't care the slightest bit about anyone or anything in the movie, so I just took it out of the player.My recommendation: if you must see this, rent, don't buy!	2.0	What a disappointment.	2007-07-12	24	11	13

B0000640VO	Amelie	A292J90DEKMM0X	Mark Nettesheim	"Just after the start of the director's commentary in English on disc 1 of ""Amelie,"" Jean-Pierre Jeunet warns the viewer something along these lines: ""If you want to keep the beauty of the film, the poetry of the film, intact . . . DON'T LISTEN TO ME!""Granted, that advice may hold true for the commentary, with Jeunel pointing out which beautiful images were really only special effects or how many takes were required of certain scenes that look completely natural in the context of the film. But it almost certainly does not hold true for the DVD treatment itself of ""Amelie,"" which, even if it contained only half the features that it does, would STILL be one of the most wonderful and creative uses of the medium thus far. (And I say this because, as of right now, I've still only gotten through about half of those features myself!)Jean-Pierre Jeunet admits to being a ""control freak"" here, and that may well be a large reason for including a whole other disc of material whose running time is probably as long as ""Amelie"" itself. But, in this case at least, the backstory is just as engrossing, and it actually serves to complement ""Amelie's"" themes of destiny and that sense of wonder that goes unnoticed by most people. Here's the best of what I've seen of it so far:-- At the Q&A; with Jeunet at the American Cinematheque in L.A.  last January, he good-naturedly apologizes for his broken English; as with that version of the director's commentary, an interpreter prompts him periodically. (Of course, considering that he apparently didn't speak it at all when he directed ""Alien: Resurrection,"" I didn't think his English was that bad.) He goes through a few of the true and even autobiographical elements of ""Amelie"" and, when asked about the influence of the French New Wave, blurts out, half-mockingly and to great applause, ""FORGET THE NEW WAVE!"" A ""new wave"" lasts for three seconds, Jeunet says -- not 50 years. Plus, he said it was better to make a French film that the audience would enjoy -- not just the filmmakers.-- The screen tests feature Audrey Tautou, Urbain Cancelier (Collignon, the grocer) and Yolande Moreau (Madeleine Wallace, the concierge), but it's pretty obvious who's the star here. It's absolutely breathtaking to watch the lo-res video footage and see Audrey Tautou finish giving the screenmakers three-quarter shots of her face and then scrunch it up, open her eyes and just EMBODY Amelie -- and then go back to being an actress again. With Cancelier and Moreau, there's a similar sense that there's something happening, too.-- My favorite feature so far, though, is the informal chat with Jeunet, which basically features the director sitting in (presumably) his office, facing the camera and just talking in French about some of the details that he faced while preparing and filming ""Amelie."" Some of them seem downright laughable now: He'd said in interviews that he'd wanted to make a small French film with universal, heartwarming appeal but didn't think that he had the stuff for it, couldn't get financing at first for it and then was rebuffed at Cannes because the president of the festival thought the film depicted a ""nauseating Paris."" It's also interesting to visualize Emily Watson in the role of Amelie: Jeunet initially was so dead-set on getting her that he had an English version of the screenplay written because she didn't speak French. But, just as with ""Amelie"" itself, it's hard not to break into a smile when Jeunet describes the sensation that the movie caused in France. In the first weekend, ""Amelie"" almost equals the overall admissions of his first feature, ""Delicatessen."" The French title of the movie becomes a pun in newspaper headlines throughout the country. And, following a private screening at the Presidential Palace, Jacques Chirac declares it one of the best nights that he's ever had (after a bad day that apparently included burning himself while making eggs over easy) and feels invigorated enough to go back to work again. My favorite part, though, is when Jeunet shows off two pieces of mail that he received from a particularly solid fan of ""Amelie."" There's a thank-you letter featuring Fotomat pictures of the girl dressed up as Zorro and then what appears to be a mock-up of the Garden Gnome. Neither piece of mail has Jeunet's address: They get to him because the girl has written an apparently persuasive enough letter to her mailman and included it with each package.Anyway, you get the idea, and this is just a SMALL part of what's contained here. Of course, some of the stories are repeated a couple of times (both in English and in French), and it may be a bit extraneous to some viewers to sit through things like the Audrey Tautou blooper/out-take reel, the storyboard comparison and the multiple mentions that, YES, the color was digitally enhanced. But in a way, all these features reinforce the fact that ""Amelie"" really is a film much greater than the sum of its parts, and just as with the film itself, there's almost always something to catch your eye and demand your attention.Bottom line, though: The DVD package of ""Amelie"" is beautifully faithful to the magic of the theatrical version, and it will definitely be something to treasure for a long, long time."	5.0	The DVD features are almost a marvel in themselves. . . .	2002-07-18	3	3	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3B7HKEHECA9TI	Mark Twain &#34;Sam&#34;	Don't get me wrong, I like quirky movies, and the quirkier the better; but there's got to be more to it - it's got to ring true on SOME level.  That's what this film is lacking - the ring of truth on any level.  Boys don't just leave their prize possesions in a box behind the wall and forget about them, ever - not unless they've been dragged away by wolves(which would have been a nice touch).  And it's exactly this same style bilge the movie keeps piling up ad nauseam.I don't blame the French - this is clearly a film that was made for the export market. I'm sure shallow and self-centered women from Liverpool to Los Angeles have no problem seeing themselves as this beautiful girl, wamdering the anticeptically idealized and sepia tinted streets of Paris, doing utterly implausible good deeds for people without ever a single thought of their own happiness.  Of course they do find a good looking hunk to love in the end - otherwise what would have been the sense doing all those stupid good deeds for people.Oh yeah, the girl is beautiful and the film is well made - for what it's worth...	3.0	Pretentious drive, but pretty to look at	2009-07-18	7	0	7

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O	"MartinP ""MartinP"""	"Amelie (or, as its proper title goes, ""The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain"") is a modern fairy tale, and a movie so unique in every way that there really is nothing to compare it with (though the makers of Big Fish took a good look at it, for sure). Set in 1997 Paris (but a version of it with quiet railwaystations, uncrowded streets and no tourists...) it nonetheless has all the atmosphere and feel of the 50s. It is sweet, funny and optimistic, yet has at its core a strange note of nostalgia and quiet melancholy. Its subtle surrealism at times expands into marvellous flights of fancy: don't be surprised to see young Amelie play doctor to a green blubber monster, to hear the bedside lamp and the paintings on the bedroom wall discuss their owner's love life, or to see Amelie's inner conflicts dramatized in the TV broadcasts she watches. None of this, however, gets in the way of the viewer's involvement with the characters, who, strange as some of them are, have a real power to move. The impression of disarming innocence is merely superficial, as becomes clear when we find Amelie wondering, while overlooking the city, how many couples are having an orgasm right at that moment (15, and we get to see them all), or when, later, she tracks down the love of her life in a sexshop. The daring mix of ingredients is thoroughly European, and, indeed, very French. This could never have come out of Hollywood.After a resume of Amelie's childhood that's as hilarious as it is effective, the story proper gets under way when Amelie hears the news of Princess Diana's death. (Don't miss the original French: to Amelie and her friends the princess is known as 'la-dee-dee'). Shocked, she drops the cap of a bottle she's holding, which rolls down the bathroom floor and dislodges a tile. Behind it, Amelie finds an old cigar box stuffed with boyhood memorabilia. Her 'fabulous destiny' is revealed to her in a flash: she will find the owner, and if he's moved by the retrieval of this box, Am&eacute;lie will dedicate her life to making others happy. And so it goes. Amelie starts working her, often very inventive, little miracles among the people in her vicinity. And a colourful bunch they are: the old man who never gets out of his house because his bones are brittle as glass, and who spent the last 20 years painting endless copies of the same Renoir; the hypochondriac Georgette, who, ironically, is a cigarette seller; paranoid Joseph, who sits in the bar where Amelie works day in day out to record observations of his ex-girlfriend's behavior on his dictaphone; Amelie's obsessive-compulsive father, and his inexplicably travelling garden gnome; the concierge, still pining 40 years on for her lost lover; the bullyish grocer Collignon, who, 'unlike artichokes' has no heart (and gets his just deserts in some of the funniest scenes in the movie), and his soft-spoken help, Lucien; and of course the strange young man who collects discarded snapshots from the garbage at railwaystation photobooths. Unfortunately, when it comes to her own happiness, Amelie is pathologically shy. Much like Austen's Emma she goes about arranging things for others, and forgetting herself: she prefers to live a dream. And when despite herself she finds the dream coming true but requiring decisive action, she comes up with some very complicated ruses. While the story unfolds, there are delightful surprises around every corner, both in little asides to the plot (Amelie wants to give some money to a pan-handler, who says 'No thanks, miss, I don't work on Sundays), and in extraordinary visual finds (when Amelie's first hopes of finding her lover are dashed, she literally dissolves into water).The film has a dreamlike quality throughout which has to do with the golden glow of the images, the surprising takes on familiair Parisian sights, and the wonderful cinematography. The effect is greatly enhanced by the fantastic musical score, with piano and musette to the fore. A feel-good movie if ever there was one, yet eschewing every staple of that genre. A must-see."	5.0	Unique	2006-07-23	3	3	0

The stylized imagery of ""Amelie"" is simply delicious and lush, from the opening credits to the end.  It is nothing like real life; it is reality that could only happen in film. And only in film as only the French could do it.Wide-eyed Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie in this storybook-like story.  Amelie is a 23-year-old waitress working in a Paris cafe, but she might as well be Madeline, that popular little denizen of Paris, for all her mischief and her child-like eagerness to make things right for other people.  A very unlikely story for a very jaded world. But director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius for pulling it off , and the score by Yanni Tiersen is a gem ( a must-buy--just listening to it conjures images of Paris sidewalks and cafes).See ""Amelie"", and helplessly fall in love."	5.0	Heavenly!	2002-07-06	5	4	1

The most important thing confirmed is, first of all,  the unavoidable fact that that individuals percieve things through the lens of their own personalities, through the eyes of their inner being,  eyes which scope ranges from the sensitive and candid perception of a curious INNER CHILD, open to details, open to that which is trascendental and radiating.And then...we also find those writing mocking reviews and  sharing the sensitivity of a HIT-AND-RUN truck driver who has just rolled his 18 wheels over his ""INNER BRAT"", while burping the ""FIVE STAR"" effect of a cold ""BUD""....Upon more time deserving descriptions, AMELIE  is a movie about the respective  liberation and fulfillment of a girl's inner fears and dreams, although more than a character, she is an icon. The wonderful thing about it all is that in the process she understands she may not achieve this without trying to help all those around her achieve this same liberation in their own particular way.

The story follows Amelie from conception to her twenty something's, filled with wild quirks and flashy fixating visuals that fix you to your seat, so much so that a passer by might think you a comatose patient, with drool and all. The drool appears as a result of the childish, lively presence of its main attraction Audrey Tautuo, who fills the main role with such charm and playfulness that it could only be described as astounding. The world this movie brings you to might not be the most realistic you've seen of this kind but it is definitely a wacky adventure of all the little things that are generally only lightly touched upon in a movie but never made it's main clause. If you're the type of person that would growl at movie's that make you go ""aaah"" then this movie is not for you, if you are not, then this is a movie that will delight you from start to finish.

B0000640VO	Amelie	ASF21UQSSRVQW	Mathias	In the beautiful city of Paris, in a beautiful apartment building, in a beautiful, cozy home, lives Amelie Poulain, who enjoys the simple pleasures of life, but longs for something more, desires, in the deepest recesses of her heart, someone to love and to have as her own.But, instead of helping herself, she begins to help other Parisians around her, whether helping them to relive their entire childhood or just to brighten their step a little, she becomes a sort of guardian angel, working good deeds wherever she goes.This film is a stunning fantasy romance, a true romance, something we as film viewers have not seen in a very long time. Audrey Tautou glides from scene to scene, as one watches her one can almost imagine her floating on wings.  Her performance is virtually flawless, every inch of her character slowly being revealed, her initial facade of perfect happiness, and her deep feelings of longing uncovered by the painter, the man they say is made of glass.Mathieu Kassovitz, as the quirky adult video store employee, is also wonderful; awkward and curious and just as longing as amelie.As the film comes to a close, the viewer cannot help but feel a tingling at the edges of his or her mouth, quickly developing into a full grin, a symbol of the true happiness the film portrays.	5.0	Fantasy and reality...	2003-09-06	4	2	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3IHQ2PZVGVLYT	mattaca	Amelie is not only an imaginative and artistically directed story, but humorous and uplifting in its presentation. For this reason alone, the movie is unique. Too many Sundance films focus on the negative underbelly of life, but Amelie is refreshing, well-acted and brilliantly directed and filmed. It combines the positivity and sweetness of Life is Beautiful (another favorite) with the vision and style of Moulin Rouge.This is one of the only movies that my parents and siblings (age 25-65) all enjoy. It's quirky and creative, but still accessible for anyone, even those who aren't big fans of foreign films. Take the 2 hours, tough out having to &quot;read&quot; a movie, and you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Favorite Movie Ever?	2004-02-16	7	4	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"Last year the selection committee at the Cannes Film Festival in France proclaimed that Amelie was not `serious enough' to be included in the event. This slight didn't harm the movie's performance. It became one of France's biggest hits ever and went on to become the highest grossing French film ever released in America.Amelie is pure fantasy. It takes place in that fabulous Paris that exists only in the movies - the Paris of Moulin Rouge, An American in Paris and Gigi. Movies as fantasy can be tricky, though. When poorly conceived, we roll our eyes and sigh, ""Only in the movies!"" But when done well, as in Amelie, we smile, feel good inside, and exclaim, ""Only in the movies!""Amelie [Audrey Tautou] is 23 years old. She had a miserable childhood. After her mother died accidentally. her father mistakenly decided Amelie had a heart condition and treated her accordingly. She watched him become lonely and sad. Now, she works in a Paris cafe, surrounded by co-workers and customers as daffy and eccentric as she is. One day she finds a cigar box with a child's toys in it. It's been hidden away in her apartment for years. She decides to find its owner, and the happiness this act brings to a stranger causes her to make a hobby out of helping people. Sometimes, if a person deserves it, she plays tricks on them, but this is just part of her plan to help them. Her biggest challenge is to trick her father into coming out of his isolation. She also falls in love with a young man who hardly knows she exists. How she gets him is as strange and delightful as the ways in which she carries out her good works.Tautou is wondrous as Amelie. Her big eyes, amazing hairdo, somewhat gawky manner, and quirky, knowing smile combine to make her character unique and charming.The movie is photographed in wonderfully rich, warm tones that make Amelie's world most inviting.Some critics seemed irritated by the movie, claiming that it manipulated their feelings. I didn't see it that way. We find out at the beginning that Amelie is a lonely child who finds happiness in a fantasy world. So, it's logical that she would see the good things in life as fantastical. Her actions always fit her odd view of reality.The biggest drawback for some viewers is that the movie is in French. Imagine that! A French movie in French!"	5.0	A superb comedic fantasy	2002-07-20	2	1	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"The movie:I won't belabor the point. Either you ""get it"" or you don't. The movie is loaded with emotion, charm, mystery, excitement, and quiet beauty. It's the story of an unusual French woman who is trying to find happiness, while not losing her quirky nature. Amelie is utterly charming and engrossing, due in part to the performance of the lead, Audrey Tautou, but also due to the really spectacularly beautiful cinematography, color palette, and shot compositions. It's in French, and that's the only audio track on this disc. So know that you will have to read subtitles. But it's worth it.The Blu-Ray:OK. What do we want in order to induce us to buy a movie on Blu-Ray that we already own on DVD? In my book, there are three things:1. A reasonable price2. All of the extras from the previous release3. A video transfer that offers an easily appreciable improvement.Long review short, Amelie on Blu-Ray delivers on all three counts. Encoded onto a single BD-50 disc, this release contains a 1080p transfer of the film itself, and all special features. The special features are all in standard definition, 4:3. This is a disappointment, but is par for the course on a catalog re-release like this. The point is, they're all here, so you can ditch your DVD.The video transfer is truly wondrous. Detail is through the roof, displaying facial pores, cloth textures, and individual hairs that just were not evident on the DVD. The amped-up, slightly hot color scheme from the DVD and theatrical presentations is preserved accurately. There are no compression artifacts or color banding evident at any point. There appears to be no visible edge enhancement, and no digital noise reduction to interfere with detail. Blacks are dark and solid, but not crushed. If your brightness and gamma are set properly, you will be rewarded with loads of detail near black, especially on Tautou's dark hair.The audio sounds pretty much like the same DTS track from the DVD. I did not notice any changes or improvements, but then, I'm not much of an audiophile. It is a dialogue heavy movie, with atmospheric surrounds only at key moments. I will say that Tatou's performance is very softspoken, so sometimes the balance between these moments required more fiddling than I would like. But it's not awful.OK - so why am I giving this 4 stars instead of 5? My main gripe is the 14 full minutes of preview material at the front end of the disc - which cannot be skipped by pressing ""Top Menu."" Instead, you have to manually advance through each stinking one, every single time you want to play the disc. There is a rudimentary ""resume"" feature, but this only saves your bacon if you failed to watch all the way through on your previous viewing, and if your player has continuous power and storage. Whenever you pop the disc in for a fresh viewing, here come the previews.It never ceases to amaze me how certain companies, and Lionsgate/Miramax is chief among them, punish their customers for purchasing their movies. I can't stand it, and it sours an otherwise lovely experience.My other gripe, which is more minor, is the paucity of subtitle options. On a 50gb disc, only having English and Spanish subs available is pretty lame. My wife had wanted a disc with French subtitles, so she could listen along with the French also being displayed on the screen. At least the titles aren't ""burned"" onto the transfer, meaning you can turn them off if you like. For those with constant-image-height front projection screens, you will be happy to know that the titles are entirely within the image field, not the letterbox bars.Conclusion:If you love this movie and have a Blu-Ray setup, it's hard to argue against this package. Cheap, beautiful, and comprehensive, it delivers on all fronts. If it weren't sabotaged by irritating decisions on the part of marketing boobs, it would be five stars all the way. As it is, it's still a must-buy for fans."	4.0	***Blu-Ray Review*** Definitely an upgrade over the DVD, but not flawless	2011-07-19	24	23	1

Not only is it a visually stimulating package inside and out, but the 2 disc set comes complete with a very enjoyable commentary (can you say you've sat through any other commentary besides the Simpsons?) and the audition tapes are worth the DVD on their own.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A374CXEFOOX5DU	M.C. Hewins	Amelie is without a doubt one of the most witty, funny, and universally charming films ever made. This film should be in everyone's rainy day collection. It never fails to warm my heart and cheer me up. People far more eloquent than me have been gushing about the sublime story, acting, and direction for the last decade since the film's release. I'll be content to gush about the Blu-ray version.WOW! Beyond every endearing aspect of this film in an emotional and intellectual sense, it is a cinematographic splendor of eye candy. I remember being amazed by its visual beauty when the film was first released, the Blu-ray technology is splendidly  rendered in this remarkably beautiful film. The colors pop and burst in each seen. The color Green is so present in this film, it's is like a character in its own right. Every hue is magnificently rendered in the Blu-ray version.As another reviewer noted, there are a lot (six 2+ minute length) of previews on the Blu-ray that you have to fast-forward individually, which is always disappointing on a non-rental disc.Whether or not to upgrade films to Blu-ray is entirely dependent upon the quality of the transfer. A lot of care and expertise went into this transfer. It is gorgeous! Highly recommended!	5.0	Magnifique Blu-ray!	2012-03-23	3	3	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A370Z6I5GBWU44	"M ""Delicious Strawberry"""	I've been hearing about this movie for a long time - nearly since it came out here to the States, but it is not until yesterday that I finally had the chance to watch this film. And I certainly was not disappointed.The story is interesting and quirky, with some laugh-out-loud scenes (such as Amelie wondering how many people are having an orgasm at a certain moment) as well as each person being given a brief bio and what they like or do not like. Some of it is crazy stuff, like what happened to Amelie's mom. There's a cool array of characters here, and I loved the revelation about the one guy who keeps getting his picture taken in the photo booth - I certainly didn't see that coming. What is it? Nah, I shan't spoil you. There's some funny lines and scenes here, and a few thought-provoking ones, though I wish Amelie and her new boyfriend didn't play cat and mouse so much, it got repetitive towards the end. Overall this is a funny and quirky film, and highly enjoyable, so I give it 4/5/5 stars.	5.0	Delightful	2010-07-11	2	2	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	AZCCZUD13FRKP	Meera Fox	This is the most creative, hilarious, and delightful movie I have ever seen.  The opening credits are one of the best parts, so don't skip them.  The movie shows all the sensual pleasures we enjoy but never verbalize or pay attention to, like how it feels to sink your hand into a sack of grain, the sound of stones skipping, coins spinning, or making a crystal glass sing, the way a leaf feels against your mouth, popping bubblewrap, and cracking the top of creme brulee. It is also about ethical activism, making a difference in others' lives, and living bigger than one's fears and limitations.  It is visually breathtaking and perfectly acted.  Every character in the story collects something.  Some collect evidence, others collect sayings, photographs, polaroids, footprints, funny laughs, love letters, paintings, symptoms, and strategies.  The characters are quirky but completely real, and each one a part of each of us.  It made me laugh so hard my stomach muscles hurt the next day. I saw it many times and discovered layer upon layer of detail each time. You will love it!	5.0	The best movie I ever saw	2002-03-19	13	11	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	Amelie had never really appealed to me before now. My dad bought it a while ago, and has been hassling me to watch it. It's only when I decided that I had to have A Very Long Engagement (by the same director, and also starring Audrey Tatou), that I decided I had to check this one out first.Audrey Tatou is simply wonderful, and a joy to watch. I wasn't keen on the hairstyle, although it highlighted her perfect cheekbones. She was full of expressions, and even the simplest widening of her eyes, or something similar was wonderful.The film was also full of the most unique characters I've seen in a long time, and they steal the show out from under Audrey's feet. I particularly liked the old guy who painted. He was spying on Amelie & she was spying on him at the same time! The film is almost entirely focused on the title character, a loner in life, who found sex unenjoyable (what?!), and entertains herself by helping others. The subtitles aren't offputting at all, which can sometimes be found in films. You do however wish you were fluent in French, it can make it so much easier! There's actually a guy in this film, who has a hobby of collecting the torn up photos from photo booths, and piecing them back together. And then keeping them all in an album. Audrey finds this album, and then discovers there's always a reacurring face amongst them. Who is he? Watch the film & find out.The film can come across as quite childish, but there's also a lot of mentions of sex. Amelie sitting on top of a roof, wondering how many people out there are having orgasms, the striptease, the couple getting it on in the cafe, and the adult shop.There's a couple of really funny scenes, but the one that's really memorable for me, is the scene with the blind guy. Amelie spots him trying to cross the road, takes his arm, and promptly takes him across the road, and further on, describing everything around them, before leaving him at the station. She probably took him ages out his way, but that's never mentioned.Movies like this one don't come along very often, and I urge you to go and see it - and then go see A Very Long Engagement, which I'm dying to get on DVD! However, I fear it's a film you'll love or hate, but give it a try. You have to try everything once.	4.0	Simply brilliant, a must see	2005-07-10	3	2	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3BL7O8WZCZ91E	Mellow Monk	This film does what all great films do: it delivers a universal message through an entertaining, well-crafted story and a wonderful attention to detail. On the surface this is a light-hearted, quirky tale about a young woman finding true love, but this is no sappy romantic comedy. In a way, the film is about a woman overcoming the poor training for life that she received from a cold, distant father and a hopelessly neurotic mother. (But don't be put off by this seemingly gloomy topic of dysfunctional parents: the filmmakers use just enough comedy to avoid being grim, yet at the same time do not go to the other extreme of all-out comedy.) A shut-in who is unable connect emotionally with people, a grown Amelie eventually discovers the joy of being a do-gooder, but even this she must do anonymously, from a distance. Only with the (sometimes unintentional) assistance of those whom Amelie has helped (including her beau-to-be) does she finally conquer her shyness and anxieties to find true love. The film also comments on the idiosyncratic or self-centered things that people do to compensate for being unable to love: hypochondria, stalking an ex-lover, obsessing about the lives of strangers, living in the past. But such bold statements and universal themes are made subtly enough not to distract from the story in this brilliant film.--MellowMonk.com	4.0	Quirky film with an ultimately upbeat message	2005-11-30	6	5	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	A brilliant comedic love story using color enhancement and other digital special effects, &quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; catapults the viewer into the world of Am&eacute;lie Poulain from the time of her birth, when she is 6 years old (played by Flora Guiet), and in her early 20's (played by Audrey Tautou) when she is working as a waitress at the Two Windmills Caf&eacute; and living in the Parisian neighborhood of Montmartre.  Being rather shy, her life is rather solitary and private until she discovers a tin box hidden behind a bathroom tile in her apartment on the night that Princess Diana is killed.  The tin box contained keepsakes of a young boy who had lived in the same apartment 50 years earlier.  Am&eacute;lie decides that she must find the child who is now a 50+ year old man and return his box.  From that point, Am&eacute;lie's life is never the same as she begins a crusade to do nice things for other people to help them, including her father; but she prefers to remain completely anonymous.  Ultimately, she is forced to confront her shyness after she falls in love with Nino Quincampoix (played by Mathieu Kassovitz) and can no longer remain anonymous.I had no difficulty reading the English subtitles as &quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; is in French and no English-dubbed version is available.  In the widescreen DVD version, the subtitles are placed in the black area below the picture so that they don't interfere with the film.  Also, the letters are large so that the subtitles are easy to read.My favorite part on the the second disk in the 2-disk DVD set are the interviews with the director/writer Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but it also includes cast auditions, out-takes, a story-board comparison, home movies and a scrapbook.I am very pleased to own a copy of &quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; in my DVD film collection!	5.0	&quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; Is One of the Best Films from 2001!	2002-09-09	4	3	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1YY9CAIF9RM2C	M. Hester	This is the kind of movie that you just have to smile the whole way through. It's also a film that while not being like the average French film manages to seem quintessentially French/Parisian. The Paris in the film is not the true Paris overidden with the strife of a country and city coming to grips with a poor economy and becoming multi-cultural, but the golden, sun-drenched Paris of old movies, post cards, and honeymoon dreams. The heroine is the 23 year-old lonely cafe waitress who is more at home with her vivid imagination, cultivated over the years to make up for her lack of friends,and stratagems than with people around her. Her good works whether they work(such as the little box of trinkets that starts it all) or whether they flop(like her little matchmaking scheme), they always manage to enchant. Her most amazing stratagem in the whole movie is however the one that could keep her from obtaining the happiness that she has given to others, no matter how briefly. The acting is superb. Audrey Tautou reminded me of another Audrey with her pixie haircut, dark eyes, and heavy eyebrows. She kept Amelie from being an overly cute caricature.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	There is a profound sadness and a distinct mean spiritedness that is at the very core of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's &quot;Amelie.&quot; And appropriately enough both of these attributes are part, but not all, of what makes Amelie (Audrey Tautou) not only tick but tick in a full-bodied, fleshed out, multi-dimensional and interesting way.&quot;Amelie&quot; is the story of a Parisian waitress and do-gooder who takes it upon herself to correct some of the wrongs she sees in her daily life: she's a vigilante for the unloved, the infirm, the love-sick, the handicapped.  So why is she incapable of approaching Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a man for whom she has fallen in love and righting her own love life?The character of Amelie and the beguiling performance of Audrey Tautou very much calls to mind Guilietta Massina in &quot;Nights of Calabria,&quot; even though the tone of these two films is very different.  The film that &quot;Amelie&quot; most calls to mind is Joshua Logan's &quot;Fanny&quot; with Leslie Caron.  On the surface both films, one set in Marseilles and the other in Paris, are lighthearted and sunny but there is definitely a dark undercurrent to both stories. They also share a tone of deep forboding and yearning which is interesting because these are the traits I found so resonant in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's only American film, the much maligned &quot;Alien Resurrection.&quot;&quot;Amelie&quot; is shot is super saturated, yet filtered color that makes it appear muted and somewhat aged.  This was the same technique used in &quot;Burnt Money&quot; and adds another visual dimension to both films.&quot;Amelie&quot; can be interpreted on at least two levels: on the surface level as a humorous Dolly Levy-type story of a woman who, with a twinkle in her eye, helps others as one would do in charity or as the story of a deeply troubled woman who rights the wrongs she sees around her as a way of helping herself feel important and wanted; getting as much as she is giving.Either way, &quot;Amelie&quot; is fun and important yet inviting...pulling you into the world it creates with vividly drawn characters and situations.  My hat is off to Mr. Jeunet and Ms. Tautou.	4.0	The Vigilante	2001-12-03	6	5	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1R2FHXQXSBEZT	"Michael J. Domingues ""black eyes"""	This is an art film. Amelie is a true sweetheart who's story could only be told through the imaginative and captivating colours and impressions captured visually in this film. She's a French girl alone living in a flat away from her father who'm she visits often. Her mother died when she was very young and she believes she has a heart condition her father diagnoses her with when young. Things are ho hum until she dicovers hidden in her flat a tin container that opens an adventure which will change her life forever. Audrey Tautou could not be equalled by any other pretty face for this role. She is Very cute, unique and enchanting to watch. The French and pretty much all of europe/ scandinavia have been the true originals when it comes to film. This is so cleverly and beautifully written and filmed that I would scarcely begin to make comparisons. What more can I say....., well maybe if your an average american who is completely devoid of a creative imagination don't bother, but if you like true originality then this is something that will inspire and captivate. Oh yeah, if there's subtitles and your very lazy, then don't write an ignorant and insipid review please!	5.0	bonjur mademoiselle	2006-01-10	6	4	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1RPTVW5VEOSI	Michael J. Edelman	What a beautiful witty and absolutely breathtaking movie! I have't been so entertained, so elevated and so enthralled over a film in decades.The basic plot of the movie has been recopunted by others, and so I won't go into it in detail here; essentially it's the story of a young girl looking for meaning in her life, who finds it in making others happy. But there's so much more than that; the plot is almost incidental to the magic.Movies like Amelie show what really great films can accomplish while at the same time showing the paucity of imagination of most multi-million dollar Hollywood epics. There's so much detail, so much imagination and so much pure joy here that you'll find yourself constantly laughing out loud and crying with delight. The characters aren't the two dimensional fashion models you'll find in a &quot;Titanic&quot;, but rich, full people, the sort you feel you might know, people whom you care about.This is a film to be seen again and again, to be savored and to be shared. I don't own that many films, but this is one I simply must have for my collection.	5.0	Romance, humor, wisdowm, art, music...	2001-11-17	5	3	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	"""Amelie,"" directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, tells the story of a waitress who engages in an extended, game-like romantic flirtation with an eccentric young man while at the same time playfully meddling in the lives of the people around her. The film is a romantic comedy with quirky accents of fantasy and absurdism.As the title character, the lovely Audrey Tatou is a delight. Amelie is a mischievous woman-child, both sexy and oddly innocent. Tatou is excellently complemented by Mathieu Kassovitz, who plays Nino, Amelie's romantic interest. Kassovitz brings an appealing, dreamy vulnerability to his oddball role. The rest of the cast brings a lot of life to their roles: Amelie's gloomy father, a brittle-boned artist known as the ""Glass Man,"" a hypochondriac tobacco salesgirl, and others.Overall, this is a fun, lighthearted film. I was intrigued by the recurring motif of England's Princess Diana, who functions as a sort of patron saint throughout the film. The film is filled with many clever visual flourishes: pictures that come to life and talk, etc. If you're in the mood for some sexy, silly, imaginative romance, go for ""Amelie."""	4.0	A charming romantic confection	2002-02-26	5	1	4

After I watched it , I found myself wondering why Hollywood can't make more movies like this one . While all of the blockbuster films here are centered around killing , drugs , and sex without love , Amelie is an incredibally moving story about a young woman who truly desires to help people . It show us how a single act of kindness can change lives . Isn't that something we should all keep in mind ? Oh yeah ,...

It is not funny, it is artsy to other pseudo-intellectuals, and it is incredibly boring and slow. You care nothing about the characters and the story is NOT interesting at all. So so so bad.

I would stage a bet that says there is not one single man alive that would not fall madly in love with the main character Amelie. I have a friend in Paris that told me that after the filming of this movie, there is a scene in the film which takes place at a public phone box, people came and cut the phone recievers from the phone boxes simply because Amelie might have held them.  As lame and childish as that may sound... go see the film, and maybe you will see why they wanted to have something that this sweet heart held to her trademark red lips.	5.0	Best Film in Years	2001-09-20	3	1	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	AHLZBVOKCM191	michaelsays	this is one of the most beautiful love stories ever made into a film...everything about it is charming.i never thought i would care for a love movie of any sort beacuse Hollywood has a way of making carbon copies of the same love movies ever since Casablanca...but leave it up to the French to make something that's so beautiful and so original. Actually the French tend to make very melancholy movies that end very sadlybut with the touch of enigmatic Lou Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children) came one of the most beautiful love story ever made...everything about this film is so well manicured... it seems that every detail from the sets, the music, the costumes to a very sweet story is highly paid attention to.the sets were wonderful... everywhere you looked on the screen seem to glow or shine with brilliance... Jeunet seems to be telling you to slow down and look how beautiful life is! the cinematography is always full. what Jean does for this small town in France reminds me what Woody Allen did for Manhattan... he makes you fall in love with it.and if anyone came away from this film not loving Audrey Tatou they did not watch this film... having seen other films with Audry i realized that she's just playing a character (contrasted from her brooding Senay in Dirty Pretty Things) but i think most people would like to always see her in this role... she pulls off the right amount of innocent and beauty that Am&eacute;lie demands...i could only pray that someone like Am&eacute;lie would be meddling with my life...the subtle touches with the special effects were not overwhelming but very fitting (the talking paintings and pictures... the melting into water and some the amazing shot of Am&eacute;lie skipping stone)everything about this film seemed to fit toghther... i recommend to anyone who is feeling downhearted and needs a little faith in the human spirit!	5.0	most charming films ever made	2005-03-23	5	2	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3M8NRILCIX13Z	Michelle	With a delightfully playful exterior and subtle inner wisdom, Am&eacute;lie reveals a world within the world of our perceptions, where not everything absolutely must be as it seems, if only you take a moment to peel away the surface layers of life&#8217;s hidden fruits and let the pulp rain in droplets onto your tongue.A magical composition of stories within a story, Am&eacute;lie challenges us through gentle suggestion and colorful detail to think past the ordinary, to see the world through our mind&#8217;s eye and, as Amelie does herself, to notice the things nobody else does. Vibrant, fascinating and compelling characters encourage us to see past the outer weave of personality and peek inside, where everyone has a little lost soul inside, waiting to be appreciated.Most of all, perhaps, this story reminds us that a world of inspiration is often as close as our own backyard.	5.0	Delightful!	2002-07-25	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1Y78WGTPIN9YV	"Michelle ""Navy Gunner"""	"A movie filled with coincidences and love.  I felt that the movie was pure excapism. The color of the film even added to the fantasy state.  The characters were beautiful and the landscape was great.  I do not speak French, so I highly relied on the subtitles.  Now with all translation, I except that there's some loss of beauty to the language. But I was still very impressed with the story and language in subtitle.It's been over a decade since this movie was released and I still enjoy this movie.  So I disagree that this movie was overrated.  This movie isn't staying on the shelf collecting dust, unlike other movies that are overrated or forgetable.  And owning this special editing is worth every penny.Andr&eacute; Dussollier was perfectly fitted as the narrator.  His voice helped give it that fantasy air.Audrey Tautou was great in this movie.  Am&eacute;lie Poulai is quite the character.  She reminds me a little of Jane Austen's ""Emma.""  Audrey was both sweet and tom-boy cute.  I like this actress and have watched others that she's been in.  Audrey is a good actress.Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix was perfect.  I really liked this actor.  He's both gorgeous and shy.

As she sets out on her adventure, she does so in such a charming, quirky way that she pulls the viewer right in.  We are ALL Amelie.  We cheer for her.I wish more American films were like this: not wearing it's heart on it's sleeve, not afraid to be a little gentle, a little tender while at the same time being hilariously funny!

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1JMQ88IMH0XJL	Mike	"""Amelie"" (2001)Since this movie was released just a little while after the September 11th tragedy, I think all viewers gave a certain warmth towards it because it was such a feel-good film and that's just what audiences needed after seeing the twin towers crash down. I actually saw this movie about December of 2001, so I wasn't as affected by the cheery state of this film as the viewers watching it a month or so after the tragedy were. None-the-less, Amelie still made me smile.Alas, there were problems though. At times I felt very manipulated by the film and had the feeling that the movie was trying too hard to get me to like it. The most annoying thing about the movie is it goes on for a little too long. The film develops an excellent first half, but it bogs down just a little in the second half with an only mildly interesting love story that remains mysterious for far too long.This definitely isn't a bad movie though. I had some dislikes, but overall, I enjoyed Amelie and it kept me happy. Mostly due to Audrey Tatou's amazing screen presence. She brings much light and warmth to her character, and I look forward to her becoming a big star in future films, and maybe not just French ones.The characters are developed very well and I loved how at the start of the movie it had voice-over's about the characters likes and dislikes, and their style of living, how old they are and so on and so on. The movie doesn't just develop its characters with words; it also uses movements, facial expressions and quotable one-liners to make these people more 3-dimensional.Amelie is also good for a laugh. Many of the scenarios are laugh-out-loud funny (Amelie punishing her neighbours, a cigarette saleswoman having sex for the first time in months, very publicly!) and others are just small laughs that earn big smiles. I enjoyed the laughs and kindness of the movie, and I liked how the title character wanted to do things to make others' lives better. It made me feel like I wanted to do something good for somebody else. Sometimes Amelie was a bit too in-your-face nice, like do we really need the lead character giving us nice, cute smiles every 5 minutes, and showing us spoons nicely, while being nice? There were really no dark aspects of the movie, but I suppose that is not exactly a flaw because the aim of the game was probably to make Amelie as much of a a bright, fun, happy film as it could be, but I would've liked a bit more genre range.All in all, this movie earned my respect and I recommend it, but it certainly wasn't the best film of 2001, as many critics and festivals are calling it. It was simply a quirky, funny little number that you can watch once, smile and laugh with it, and then forget about it after a few days.MY GRADE: B"	4.0	Hugely overrated, it none-the-less made me smile	2002-04-09	12	5	7
B0000640VO	Amelie	A11V6FYFROYRU1	Mike Nordstrom	This movie is an excellent example of what a comedy/romance movie should be. It's thoughtful, charming, and emotionally realistic. For once a movie has a refreshing character such as Amelie, who falls in love but never loses her independence for the sake of a hackneyed romance plot. By giving this movie a five-star rating, I mean that this movie is flawless in every way. See this movie by any means necessary.	5.0	Sweet Holy Jesus	2001-12-12	2	0	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	In &quot;Amelie,&quot; Jean-Pierre Jeunet employs the whole panoply of Nouvelle Vague camera and narrative tricks first used by Truffaut, Godard and Malle. He uses them in the service of a sweet, funny story about a young waitress who decides to become the secret benefactress of her eccentric neighbors in Montmartre. The camera charges, darts, swirls and loops as Amelie plays matchmaker, reunites middle-aged men with boyhood treasures, wreaks quiet havoc on the life of a nasty grocer who berates his mentally challenged assistant. The camerawork is incredible, and in Audrey Tautou--with her confiding grin and Louise Brooks-meets-Leslie Caron beauty--Jeunet has found an actress eminently worth photographing. This film, being French, is blase about the existence of sex shops, orgasms, etc., so the blue-nosed be warned. The rest of us will respond with joy to the sunny, stylized Paris of &quot;Amelie.&quot;	5.0	Sweeter and more French than creme brulee.	2001-12-02	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1JF7YECBBRN1O	Monica Murphy	I never saw this movie when it came out because it was so hyped. Recently, I became interested in French New Wave, and started thinking of other French films I hadn't seen yet. Watching &#34;Amelie&#34; was a joyful experience. The friendship between Amelie and Mr. Dufayel is one of the most poignant I've ever seen in a film. He's supportive when he needs to be, yet he also knows when to nudge her towards self awareness. Sure, there are fantastical elements and a fairy-tale vibe, true. Some of the criticism thrown at this film was for valid reasons (not enough diversity). But, what it truly is for me, is a story about an introverted, lonely woman who learns to help others and take her place in the world.	5.0	My favorite movie!	2013-05-04	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1EGUW37OPF12O	"Moonface ""Byron Zoolander!!!"""	"The term ""magic"" -- as relating to movies and not just the word for a witch's spell or a magician conjuring a rabbit -- was long ago co-opted by the likes of Disney and Spielberg. The Disney and Spielberg corporate machines turned ""magic"" into just another gear in the works, with shots of awed actors gazing at something amazing followed by some jaw-dropping special effects shot.It's been a long time that something truly magical, not phony or manufactured, has graced the silver screen. So Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie (a.k.a. Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain) comes as a most welcome new gem. It deserves to be cherished, hugged and celebrated.Audrey Tautou (Venus Beauty Institute) stars in the title role, an adorable, waifish little darling who reminded me, by turns, of Charlie Chaplin, Giulietta Masina and Audrey Hepburn. On the day of Princess Diana's death, Amelie finds a little box hidden in the bathroom of her little Montmarte apartment: a little boy's treasure chest from years gone by. She decides to return it to its now grown-up owner without revealing herself to him. When she sees the man's reaction -- shock, joy and tears -- she vows to perform more good deeds.Most of these deeds involve a great deal of clever preparation, and these play out like the ""Mousetrap"" game, where one seemingly unconnected move leads to another one and they all logically connect only at the end.For example, an incredibly sour man sits around in the cafe where Amelie works pining after his ex-girlfriend who also works there. Using several small, nearly untraceable steps, Amelie plants the seeds for new love between the man and a dowdy, hypochondriac woman who works the cigarette counter.This and the many wonderful other episodes never run back to back. They're cleverly intertwined with one another, keeping the mysteries moving along at the right speed.Of course, Amelie's greatest challenge is to find love herself, which is not easy for such a shy girl who can't even show up to take credit for her own good deeds. In one scene, after she lets her potential soulmate Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) walk away from her door, she literally melts (thanks to some brilliantly-utilized CGI effects).The movie begins daringly, with a narrated flashback to Amelie's childhood explaining her quirky personality and running some 20-odd minutes before the actual story even begins. This talky, cartoony sequence had the potential to alienate viewers quickly. But instead it easily and quickly sets up the film's warmth, humor and charm that it sustains perfectly throughout.It's difficult to describe the look of the film, which is painstakingly precise, but colorful, airy and alive at the same time. It's like a Chuck Jones cartoon, but slower, and like an MGM musical, but faster. In order to get the precise vision of sunniness and goodness he wanted, director Jeunet digitally altered Montmarte's look, taking out the garbage and graffiti, and even changing the clouds above into more decorative shapes. It's a utopian vision of how great the world could really be if generosity were traded regularly and not hoarded like gold.Amelie shows a completely unusual side of Jeunet, who created the dark, bizarre underworlds of Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children (both co-directed by his former collaborator Marc Caro) and Alien Resurrection. Jeunet has now expunged all traces of weirdness and darkness to make this lovely new confection.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon proved that American mass audiences can and will sit through a movie with subtitles, and I suspect that the subtitles on the French-language Amelie will likewise not deter them. This is a movie that audiences all over the world have treasured, and America shouldn't be any different.I also foresee Oscar nominations for Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet, and one big one for Best Picture (that is if distributor Miramax can let go of its quasi-talented ""prestige"" director Lasse Hallstrom and his new film The Shipping News and put its muscle behind this one instead). Like Amelie herself, I'm moved to do a good deed and share this movie with everyone"	5.0	AMELIE ROCKS	2005-09-26	5	4	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	AEDK2VWYZOH93	"mothermaven ""webjaw diva"""	I have found this film -- a film that I can watch multiple times and I frequently come up with excuses to put this DVD in to be transported into Amelie's world. The film begins introducing Amelie as an inventive little girl, whose isolation is due to a simple misunderstanding by her parents. Her doctor father thinks she has a heart condition because her little heart beats faster during the only time she has physical contact with him through his stethoscope.Amelie's world has intense colors and the beautiful sights of Paris where she enjoys simple pleasures.She dips her hands into a bag of beans for the guilty tactile pleasure of it.The sound of cracking the crust of her brulee delights her.She wants to be loved, but is shy and retreats into her own little world.A random event propels her to find and help a stranger, which leads her to become somewhat of a superhero of kindness to those in need and impish retribution to the mean. This is cleverly woven with a series of urban myths reenacted as in the traveling gnome. Her journey takes her from helping strangers, neighbors, co-workers, friends, family, and ultimately herself. Her actions in a way set free those she helps whether it is allowing them to get out and travel, feel better against a verbal insults, have some closure in the face of lost love, or find your soulmate.Yes. Audrey Tautou is an adorable actress and is a perfect fit for the character of Amelie. Yet, I have seen her in other films being equally charming, but the films fall flat for me. What makes this film is the collection of quirky characters, the amazing cinematography, the clever writing, and the attention to details.I often recommend this film as a great date movie because it does turn into a charming, quirky, funny, ultimately romantic experience for Amelie without being too sweet or too sappy. There a things for both men and women to appreciate.	5.0	Romantic Feast for the Senses & The Soul	2007-08-28	4	3	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A330FTZTW57U32	M. Rael	Its a shame that some people are too immature to embrace such a wonderful film because of stuck-up and prudish judgements. There are scenes in Amelie showing, for example, the results of her wondering how many couples are having an orgasm in Paris right then..  or showing the interior of the sex shop where Nino works. A great movie like Amelie makes it all the more sad to realize how uptight and musty people can be.  If that werent so I would lend my mother the movie to watch.	5.0	Perfect	2009-02-04	1	1	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	'Amelie' is a French film that tells of Amelie's (Tatou) desire to help others whilst at the same time realising that she needs helping herself.  Usually this kind of movie would be cloying and sentimental but Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to keep it both light, touching and at times marvellously funny.Tatou is an absolute revalation as the central character, managing to remain at once cute and feisty.  Also important is the manner in which Amelie helps people, not just with small favours but with careful thought and intent that has a beautifully touching effect.  Added to this is a wonderful score and sumptuous photography that completely immerses its audience into the streets and gardens of Paris.What's great about it though is that its never too sentimental and at times is genuinely humorous.  For instance, the list of what each character likes and dislikes is fantastically well observed.  To conclude, it's been a long time since there's been a movie of this kind that is both heart-felt and touching.  This is a movie with bounce in its step - a modern classic!	5.0	Just lovely	2002-05-05	8	7	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	Am&eacute;lie is the feel good whimsical romantic comedy that has broken all French box office records (around 8 million people in France alone have seen it), charmed many British audiences and is now winning lots of fans in North America. But is it any good? In short, yes. It's very good.Don't worry about the subtitles, there's no problem in following screenwriters Guillaume Laurant and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's plot. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's doe-eyed heroine Am&eacute;lie (Audrey Tautou) has had a lonely childhood and an unsatisfying love life. Her father is a glum recluse, who never offered her any physical contact, warmth or love (but who cherishes his garden gnome) and her neurotic mother was killed by a suicide jumper who hit her on the way down outside Notre Dame. As a result, Am&eacute;lie has become wrapped up in her dreams as a way of escaping her lonely life. By day, she waits table at a Montmartre brasserie frequented by many eccentric characters and at night, she goes home alone to a little box flat with a rear window from where she can spy on her neighbours and dream of what their lives must be like. Until one day when she discovers a box of discarded toys left behind in her apartment 40 years ago and begins a search for the man-boy who once owned them. Finding that she can make a difference to other peoples lives, Am&eacute;lie's own life is given a new purpose and a new vocation but can she find love and happiness for herself?Some critics have complained that Am&eacute;lie's is a right wing exercise in nostalgia and that Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's depiction of Montmatre is too lushly perfect, whilst others have criticised it for being nothing more than a rip-off of Jane Austen's Emma. All of these criticisms are unfair (although there are obvious comparisons in the plot that can be made to Emma) and downright offensive. There is no obvious political agenda on display here and so what if the streets of Montmatre are picture postcard friendly? Am&eacute;lie's Montmartre may just be a dream but it's a beautiful dream. Who cares if in the real France most people eat at Burger King or Mc.Donalds or shop at a supermarket for their groceries? Am&eacute;lie's Montmartre is an enchanted place, where the water's of the canals are blue and sparkling and the scenery picture perfect.Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Director of the much darker Delicatessen and City of Lost Children), has created his own universe and populated it with some wonderfully eccentric characters, thus allowing some of France's finest actors to charm their audience with a proliferation of visual humour and pseudo-philosophical dialogue. In particular, Serge Merlin, the wise old artist from across the street, conjures up magical wisdom and steals most of his scenes, as does Rufus, as Am&eacute;lie's morose father. However, make no mistake this is the rather beautiful and elfin-like Audrey Tautou's movie and she captures your heart with her big doe-eyes and her mischievous smile and plays the role of Am&eacute;lie to whimsical perfection.Am&eacute;lie will capture your heart; make you smile, make you laugh and send you off into the night glowing happily, with a little bit of faith and hope in life restored. We all like to feel good about ourselves and Am&eacute;lie is well worth checking out for anybody who enjoys a little romance and dares to dream.	5.0	QUIRKY BUT FULL OF GALLIC CHARM!	2002-01-24	14	13	1

Rojas	I studied abroad in Paris this past spring, and _Amelie_ (known in French as _Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain_, a much more creative title) was one of the defining experiences of my time there.  This film cannot fail to fill the viewer with joy, be it through its warm color palette depiction of Paris, through its haunting musical score, or through the heart-warming performance of  Audrey Tautou as a naive, sprite-like Parisian girl who decides to bring joy to her neighbors' sad lives and in doing so, finds love herself (the romantic interest is sweetly interpreted by Mathieu Kassovitz, distinguished director of _La Haine_).  The stylized performances of the cast together with Jeunet's meticulous cinematography, eclectic editing, and seemingly magical touch weave a spectacular and unforgettable film.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2XNRND8AWEHM8	MSaf	I really enjoyed this film. Most men do. I discovered that most women aren't that interested in it, however. Here's why: the movie depicts a beautiful, very beautiful, young woman, who is lonely. Just that idea on it's own can be very appealing to a man. That there can be a woman out there who is beautiful, but alone, and lonely. Second of all, in the film she falls in love with a pretty much ordinary guy. That idea, again, is very appealing to most men, and can identify with that ordinary guy, and think it is realistic that he, the viewer, could be him.The entire movie is set up for the viewer to fall in love with amelie. Besides that, the movie is very clever, and very interesting, but if you are a woman, or just plain unaffected by amelie's charms, you will find the movie merely cute.	5.0	I really enjoyed this movie	2002-03-19	4	2	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	AD7GOCNOMJ4OZ	M. Sennott	In &quot;Amelie&quot; we are treated to the best that the overseas film industry has to offer - an eclectic, fun, well developed film. The title character is a shy eccentric young woman who decides to improve the lives of her Parisian acquaintances with a series of anonymous good deeds. However, as in any good story, there is a deeper motive for her actions - she is tentatively expanding her own sense of self and discovering who she really is. The writing is witty and the film was very well made.

Perhaps Woody Allen would be the only Hollywood director who might come close.  For one thing, in classic French form, this movie has things about sex which only a foreign film would ever show in a such a humorous way.  It has strange eccentric characters, like her neighbor she spies on who is always working on copying the famous Renoir painting The Boating Party, which he as copied like 20 times.  The entire movie is a kaleidoscope of eccentric people who live in Paris.  And the movie has a very cute plot of how Amelie, shy in her own life, constantly tries to help others.  The whole movie takes a fun twist as she discovers a box from long ago that is filled with memorabilia by a boy, and she decides to return it.  As you can tell, the story just has a lot of fun and quirky side stories that makes it entertaining.Audrey Tautou is so adorable.  I wouldn't rate this movie as a 5 star because that would be putting it right up there with her very best movies.  But it is a true delight and if you want something that will just make you smile and laugh and periodically go, ""What the hell is going on?"", all while beaming from ear to ear as the cutest actress in the world enchants you, then this movie will do it.Audrey Tautou is utterly adorable and Amelie shows off just how cute she is."	4.0	Audrey Tautou is Adorable	2013-07-07	0	0	0

The imagery, tale, and whimsy all put together on one tiny disc so beautifully, that once you see this you will feel the same.The first thing you will notice is the stunning camera work, then the actors, then the plot.  The direction of this is so brilliant.  The tale itself is pure whimsy but it will leave you with a sense of well-being.All of the cast did an exceptional job and you will find that reading the subtitles is, in most cases, not neccessary.  The director, actors and cinematographer have the uncanny ability to tell the entire story, along with mood that even if you don't read the subtitles, or for that matter understand French you will know what is going on.  The actors delivery of thier lines let you in on every detail that is happening or about to happen.The extras on this DVD is worth a look as well. Most of the time the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; stuff that laden DVD's  is worthless, such is not the case.  Take the time to look at all of the interviews and in particular, the director and the cinematographer.  When you get a glimpse as to what it took to make this, you will be astounded.  Sure it's not full of car chases, explosions or any other very high-tech special effects, but rather the director's vision and use of color to set the tone of every single scene.  It is amazing.  When you hear those blowhard directors talk about pouring thier souls into films generally, you pay no mind.  However, with Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it's a whole different issue.  The attention he paid to even the smallest detail is impressive, to say the least.I find this film to be more palatable than his &quot;City of Lost Children&quot; which is a bit more like &quot;Brazil&quot;. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, can get a tad complicated at times, but in Amelie, he does not lose focus for one second and you finish the film with the thought that there is a little bit of Amelie in all of us, but perhaps there should be more.It doesn't matter if you are male or female, if you like action or sci-fi, this is not  a &quot;chick flick&quot;, this is a film for all.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1BS1PZMDWBML9	Naledi19	To call Amelie pretentious would be a compliment and I decline to join in the chorus of this movie's enraptured horde of admirers. In fact, this film never manages to rise to the level of pretension although it definitely aspires to do so.Amelie is the story of a young French waitress whose childhood was marred by her parents' neuroses that, in addition to other ills, caused her isolation from friends and family. Unlike others with less than prosaic childhoods, Amelie's young adulthood is singularly uneventful and unremarkable until the day she happens upon a discovery that opens her stunted and sheltered mind to the joyous possibilities inherent in helping other people in unusual ways (Put your hat back on, it's not nearly as exciting as it reads). The remainder of the plot, subplot, side plot...? consists of the typical boy meets girl - or rather girl stalks boy - romance fluff stuff.In attempting to be humorous and quirky this movie comes across as sophomoric and goofy. Where they promise serendipity, whimsy and delight, Amelie the movie and Amelie the heroine deliver contrivance, triteness, and boredom. Add to this a cast of characters who were probably designed to appear likeably average but miss the mark by simply appearing weird.Anywhere you slurp them, be it a Hollywood haunt or a Parisian caf&eacute;, these ingredients amount to a less than mediocre `soup du jour' of a film.	1.0	Intensely Underwhelming...	2004-12-27	98	29	69

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3HOF1OBYCV0I5	Nate Volkerding	There's something about european films which make me feel more kindly torwards Adam Sandler.. maybe I go from insane hatred for him to just bitter contempt. At least Adam Sandler WANTS to entertain you though. It's not just two hours of artsy, self indulgent fluff. But about Amelie..It wasn't completly awful. There are a few laughs, but they take to long setting them up and they are too far between for such a long movie. The actress is a sort of pretty, female version of Rowan Atkinson. I think if the movie had concentrated just on her and her life and been much shorter, then I might have enjoyed it. Unfortunatly, the main character is left very lightly developed and most of the other characters are almost less than stereotypes. The director only gives Amelie maybe three expressions and shoves down our throats how waifish and charming she is and how sympathetic and sorry we should feel for her. Halfway through the movie I felt myself wanting an insulin injection. The movie mostly spends time dispensing threadbare lessons about LIFE!, LOVE! and ART! (there were moments in the movie were I could imagine the art house crowd nodding their heads and saying 'so true, so true'). I guess it was more important than developing actual characters. I felt the atmosphere of French kitsch (I guess that's what it was) a little suffocating. I think the American equivalent would be like being stuck in a big parking lot filled with hot pink and aqua blue 57 chevys, each one containing an Elvis and Marily Monroe look alike.You'd think you could count on a European movie to have a clever or ambivalent or at least deppressing ending, but Amelie can't even do that. The writer can't even think of anything for the two lead characters to say once they do get together- they just skip straight to the sex. And this is supposed to be a romantic movie! How is this man any different than the facelss man Amelie is shown [fornicating with]of the movie?1.49 stars	1.0	Pretty girl finds a boyfriend -what a magical miracle..	2002-11-24	109	23	86
B0000640VO	Amelie	A14X4GKERKW535	Nathaniel L. Harper	"Last things first, this DVD had its subtitles prepared by a ""closed-captioning"" institute - you know, for the hearing-impaired? If the hearing-impaired could hear the discrepancy between the spoken French and the English subtitles, they would scream. And since there is ALOT of dialogue and narration in this film, there is ALOT of subtitling.Otherwise the film is harmless (perhaps too harmless) fun. Poor Audrey Tautou was compared (only because she had the same prenom) to Audrey Hepburn. While not equalling her in looks, Mlle Tautou is at least a better actress. The sepia-stained cinematography of Paris is, however, glorious. And the film has something conspicuously lacking lately - genuine charm (in moments).Overall, my advice is to learn French and turn OFF the subtitles. Since the star-rating system limits me to choosing between ""I Liked it"" or ""I Liked It Alot"", I went for the former. I DID like it!"	3.0	See a Dentist After	2007-04-18	16	10	6
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3VS8L85Y9FSZK	"Nathan Thoms ""Nate"""	To get this out of the way, yes, 'Amelie' is a French film, complete with subtitles and a slightly different set of goals and priorities for director Marc Caro than would be found in a blockbuster from Hollywood.  That said, 'Amelie' is a stunningly magnificent film focusing on the happiness that may be found for the protagonist for which the film is named, played perfectly by Audrey Tatou.Caro and Jeunet have teamed up before to bring such magnificent films to life asThe City of Lost ChildrenandDelicatessen.  In 'Amelie' the team brings another serving of their visual stylings that are easily described as a painting brought to life through film.The soundtrack, coloring, filming techniques, characters, and set design combine to forcefully and gracefully portray the simple life of this waitress from Montmarte and what little things are necessary in order for her to become a happy person.	5.0	Be Happy!	2007-11-25	3	3	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3TSPLFYU2UMW0	nicjaytee	"With its wonderfully surreal storyline, outstanding acting & breathtaking cinematography, ""Amelie"" is a ""feel good"" movie that achieves exactly what it sets out to do. An international hit and an instant ""classic"", its first ten minutes on their own rank as one of the funniest and most brilliantly executed sequences in any film.But... for those of us unable to speak fluent French the problem is simple: the sheer speed of it's superbly witty dialogue leaves you grappling to read the subtitles and, in so doing, seriously diverts your attention away from the equally quick-paced, stunningly directed visuals. Dubbing would have helped at one level but has been wisely avoided as it would totally destroy the key feature of the film - i.e. it is, and could only be, French! The solution?... invest in your own copy. After a couple of times through (with the ever-ready option to ""rewind"" its more complex scenes), the memory banks take over leaving you free to relish the full impact of this quite beautiful, multi-layered work of genius."	5.0	You need this on DVD or Video!	2002-05-02	5	5	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	AQ75J8JD49VWN	nick minorsky	This is a wonderful, sparkling gem of a movie, with many facets.It is a realistic slice of Parisian life, with scenes in empty subway stations, apartment rooms,bistros,  courtyards and parks. It is a quirky romantic tale of a woman getting to know herself and finding her soul mate. It is also a montage of vignettes about people in Amelie's everyday world. These characters are portrayed so well that one finds themself drawn not only to Amelie, but  to these others as well. We care about what happens to them all. Finally, and most uniquely, this movie reflects a deep truth. Amelie decides to slowly change her world, by  performing little acts of kindness for those people around her. These impish, amusing  plots of tenderness are well thought out, and do impact other lives. The viewer seems to hover over these minute events, and then witnesses with  cosmic eyesight, how something much grander unfolds. It is a rare movie which entertains and edifies. &quot;Amelie&quot; is such a movie.	5.0	Cinema Verite' ?	2002-08-20	2	2	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A10X0JN8KTK89H	ninjasuperstar	Smart comedies are often relegated to the cult bin or even the bargain bin because they lack a universal quality. _Amelie_ has the ability to appeal to everyone, to transcend any language barrier (the film is in French and comes with subtitles). In the end, the film is a different kind of romantic comedy for all of those reclusive nerds out there who live in their own world and are itching to join the outside._Amelie_ features some wonderful, playful music using instruments that U.S. movie watchers may not be familiar with.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2ASL6DAC9UY02	Nnie the Hideous New Girl	Amelie is a beautiful movie to watch, for starters.  It has vibrant colors, shapes, and tons of flashbacks and quirky moments.  This isn't a movie that's meant to look realistic.  It's like a painting, meant to extract emotion and feeling.  In this case, it works quite well.  As many say, this is indeed a very charming film.The story is simple and sweet.  A young woman, who has lived in solitude but still has the ability to smile as she observes life discovers something extraodinary; a little box of treasures that belonged to the person who last lived in her appartment.  It is decades old and filled with memories.  She makes a decision to find the owner of the box.  If he is touched by this act and finds joy in his memories being returned to him, she would continue to help people and make their lives better.  He is touched, and the story takes off from there.  But there is one last question the movie asks us to consider.  Is Amelie herself happy?  She creates complicated ways of helping people, but they never meet her.  Is she really lonely and looking to improve her life as well?The DVD quality is great.  Watching this movie really draws you into another world, and of course plenty of credit must go to the clear and eye pleasing quality that comes with this movie.  The extras are quite nice as well, with a collection of posters, an interview with the director, and an explanation on the unique cinematography of the the film.  Also, there seem to be issues over why the movie is rated R.  Simple.  It has scenes that depict [explicits].  All in all, these are fairly innocent and I'd recommend the film for anyone fifteen and up.  With no violence and cursing, there's little to find offensive.	5.0	Whimsical and Imaginative	2003-04-18	8	8	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A24VIX8W3NWVGP	Norman Becker	My wife and I saw Amelie last night and it made me remember that there was a time when films were produced and directed by artists.  When the movie ended the audience remained silent while a long list of credits scrolled down the screen. Even the credits were done with humor and taste.  When the credits were about to end the audience broke into spontaneous applause.  Its been a long time since I have experienced this kind of response to a movie. The response was well deserved.Amelie is a tribute to the human imagination and excellent acting.  It is as far away from the formula films of recent vintage, that are the creation of corporate marketing, as one can get.  The plot has unexpected twists and turns that had the audience laughing aloud when it wasn't wondering what new aspect of Amelie's personality they were about to discover. The cast was also superb.  The best way to describe the acting is to imagine that each of the roles required an excellent character  actor and that everyone delivered.  Audrey Tautou was outstanding in the title role.  She was in almost every scene but she hardly spoke.  She didn't need to.  Her actions and facial expressions said everything.Paris also contributed to the success of the movie.  It isn't the Paris that tourists come to see, however.  It is the Paris that nourishes and supports the lovable screwballs that we come to know as they go about their routine lives which would seem eccentric and implausible almost any place else.	5.0	Amelie: Remember when films were produced by artists?	2002-01-22	2	1	1

Not a usual (therefore annoying) ""I love you, you love me"" story (not that I've seen a lot of those), but rather a film about an extraordinary and broke french girl with my favourate director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, behind the camera. If you love Hollywood films like Pearl Harbor or Independance Day, then please stay away from this movie for your own good. Far from sexy chicks and ""jumping off the roof seconds before the building bursts into flames"" celebrities that I'm personally bored of seeing, Jeunet chose two ordinary characters who played the role ""I want to show my affection to you in the most wierd way."" It's amazing that many of my friends didn't like the movie and some even lacked the potential ATP production to go to the theater for this movie, but it's probably (and they'd hate me for saying this) because of their lack of imagination, creativity and wish&courage of acting just the way you want, even like a child. (I'm not sure if I put it right, but if you watch the film, you'll know what I mean) Honestly, I'm not sure about buying the DVD since I'd hate myself if I watch this movie a billion times and start getting bored of it.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3QVAKVRAH657N	"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom"""	&quot;One of my first loves was cartoons,&quot; Mr. Jeunet said. With his spiky hair, stubble- covered moon face and impish smile, he looks likea cuddlier, chubbier version of the British artist Damien Hirst. &quot;In fact, my first short films were experiments with animation,&quot; he said.This influence is palpable in every frame of &quot;Am&eacute;lie,&quot; which frequently resembles a live-action homage to the cartoonist Tex Avery.-'Am&eacute;lie': Going Sweet and Sentimental Has Its Rewards (Daniel Zalewski, 10/28/01, NY Times)Though overcute, overlong, and overcontrived, this film has such an appealing star (Audrey Tautou), tries so hard to please, and is so unexpectedly sunny (coming from France), that its flaws can be forgiven.  But at least two of those flaws are worth noting.  The first is that the cartoonishness mentioned above makes it seem as if the director is trying to distance himself from the romanticism and sweetness of his own film.  This unfortunate failure of nerve leads to a kind of self-contradictory effect, as the Tex Avery touches get wheeled out every time Mr. Jeunet seems to be embarrassed by the sentimentality of a situation he's just presented.  This may help him keep his credibility with his fellow French filmmakers but necessarily weakens what should be some of the films finer moments.  Still, if you're willing to get in the cartoon spirit they won't bother you too much.The more serious problem concerns a quintessentially French, or at least European, aspect of the plot.  The film, like Clueless, represents a modern take on Jane Austen's Emma, with its story of a young woman meddling in the love lives of those around her.  However, while Emma is one of the most underrated political novels of all time precisely because it shows the disastrous results of Emma's what we might call central planning, Am&eacute;lie assumes that such interventions would have uniformly happy results.  Oddly enough for such an otherwise whimsical movie it betrays the flaw of rationality, in its conceit that those things which Amelie can imagine would work out well continually do so.  In fact, Mr. Jeunet says that people have told him that he inspired them to become Am&eacute;lies themselves.  One shudders to think of these film-addled Frenchwomen roaming the land fixing up peoples' lives the way they think they should be.  Mr. Jeunet and his followers would do well to recall the words of the great Eric Hoffer :A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairsby minding other people's business.This, though Mr. Jeunet seems to have missed it, must be the point even of his own film.  The inherent drama lies in Amelie's attempt to fill her own empty life, which if we really had the godlike powers she improbably demonstrates might not be so empty.  But since we don't and since we are ultimately not really either responsible for nor competent to govern the lives of others, the plot of the film has to build to the moment when Am&eacute;lie herself embraces the possibility of love.Ms Tautou is so compelling an actress that we do indeed rejoice when this moment comes, and we have a pleasant enough time along the way.  But Mr. Jeunet needlessly lessens the tension with both his Bugs Bunny antics and his gallic certainty that our lives can be run better for us by others than we run them ourselves.  If only he'd imbibed the lessons of Jane Austen as deeply as those of Tex Avery it would be an even better picture.GRADE : B+	4.0	more Austen, less Avery	2002-09-07	32	12	20

The director has made other equally engaging films albeit much darker, eg. &quot;City of Lost Children&quot; and &quot;Delicatessen&quot;, but &quot;Amelie&quot; was just the right cure for the somber mood which covered America this fall.  The actress Audrey Tautou in the title role, is a wonderful fit for the character she plays.  She exudes just the right amount of &quot;Bohemian-Crunch&quot; and &quot;Franco-Beauty&quot; charm.  Shot with moments of animation, this film is one of my top 10 for 2001.  I am going to certainly own it once out on DVD.  &quot;Amelie&quot; is one of the reasons I go to see artsy-fartsy Euro-films.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AVATIT454RCG5	Patrick Metzger	Amelie is truly one of the greatest movies of all time.  I wasn't too much of a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's other endeavors such as The City of Lost Children.  Frankly, they are just TOO strange.  However, something that is apparent from the first moment of any film that Jeunet has directed is his incredible imaginative vision.  He sees entire universes within the smallest actions.  He sees fate and destiny in funny coincidences.  As you will find if you watch the special feautures, much of Amelie is inspired by childhood events that actually occurred in his life or those of friends.  I believe it is this element of true nostalgia that all of the fans of Amelie relate to.  His experiences ring true in the hearts of all.  This is where the beauty of Amelie arises.  His memories and experiences, combined with his sense of color and the way to highlight a scene, not to mention an incredible cast and one of the best film scores of all time composed by Yann Tiersen...all together they form something never before seen in the medium of film.	5.0	Simply the best...	2006-03-25	3	2	1

I have never been more impressed with a movie before. The filmmaking is stunning, the story captivating, and the characters... well... damn. Amelie is hands down the cutest character any movie has ever had, and also one of the most interesting. More so, the character is so wonderfully played by Audrey Tautou.To show you somewhat how much I loved this movie, I've started learning French again just so I can enjoy this movie without the subtitles. Of course, I hope to use it for so much more (travel, other films, etc), but this movie was what spurred me to finally study it again.So I recommend you buy this immediately.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1SIIQGG4IAJ3W	Pdx Kitten	"Feel lonely or sad? Think your life is boring? If so, then watch this movie ""Amelie""! It will warm your heart and show you that life is what you make of it. Amelie lives in a world where seemingly mundane everyday activities are transformed into exciting adventures- she chases after what she wants, and she wants others to do the same!One sad moment towards the end is when she hears her doorway screen rattle as if someone is keeping her company when she is in her apartment. She turns around with such a look of hope- of possibility- but it is only her cat brushing past the screen. Contrast this lonely moment with the finale: a scene of pure happiness, riding through the city on a motorcycle (moped) on a cold sunny day with her newfound love. The moped scene is filmed in a dream-like style and is just wonderful.Note to women everywhere: This movie is particularly appealing if you have ever lived alone in a little apartment in a big city while you yearn to discover adventure and the love of your life in the world. Amelie does just that, and by the end of the movie, she learns to let her guard down. She is finally honest with herself about what she needs to do- she grows up, overcomes her shyness, gets the guy she had been pining after and chasing for so long, and settles into content bliss.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A35DTDBS7MJDVA	PedsRN	Admittedly, this movie may be a bit difficult to follow for non-Francophones. There are many, many references that are very cultural and may completely go over the heads of people who are unfamiliar with the French culture and language. But if you, like me, are at least semi-fluent in French and have even been to France (my favorite town is Lyon, not Paris), you may love this movie as much as I do. I only say this because it is a very visual movie (what movie isn't...?), so you will miss out on a lot if you have to continuously feast your eyes on the bottom of the screen to read. That said, I loved watching it on my Kindle with the X-ray turned on, and it had a lot of fun trivia about the making of the movie (for example, that the director had the filming areas cleaned to portray the fantasy-world that Amelie lives in). I didn't know that the first time I watched the movie, and having just freshly returned from The City of Lights, I recall thinking to myself (10 years ago) &#34;Wow, I don't recall Paris being that clean&#34;.

But how does she know for sure? And how does she communicate this? In her own wonderfully quirky way, that's how.The movie is surprising, and uses an interesting method to push the plot along. You really do have to see it, but the use of imagery, photos, and artistic games lures both of these characters to one another. The test is in whether the fellow will understand her manner, and she's convinced of it because she thinks that she understands his obsession with getting passport photos from booths all over subway stations.The movie is playful in such a charming way.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3BDW1GRR19H5S	Peter J. Lusby	"I'd have to say that those who think this is the greatest French movie can't be getting out much. It has none of the power of ""Manon des Sources,"" none of the dramatic flair of ""Chocolat"" and very little of the poignancy of ""Ponette."" It is, however, a very well constructed film, and one which it has been fun to watch several times.To those unfamiliar with French culture, some of the vignettes may miss their targets. The French obsession with collecting odd things, with bicycle racing, with sending postcards from every place they visit, their willingness to be demonstrably affectionate in public, all get lampooned mercilessly. The characters are largely stereotypes; what more can one expect in a movie with so many important characters - there isn't the time to develop each one adequately, so they remain necessarily two dimensional. But it is this two dimensionality of the characters that gives the film its surreal touch that drags the viewer forward from scene to scene, wondering what can possibly happen next.As comedies go, it lacks the gross slapstick of a de Funes film, and this is very much to its credit. The subtlety of the emotional torture Am&eacute;lie applies to Collignon the greengrocer is far more entertaining than any pie-in-the-face schtick would have been. Even the running garden gnome joke fails to pall, because it is carefully not overworked. Still, if I had to designate a ""funniest french movie ever"", it probably wouldn't be this one - I'd more likely go for the James Bond style ""Une Chance Sur Deux"" which managed a better balance of types of humor, with a wider range.All in all, Am&eacute;lie is a good movie, but not necessarily a great one. It's one that is worth plopping down the money to rent, or even to buy the DVD, but I would have been disappointed if I'd paid good money to see it in a theatre - there is nothing in the movie that could take advantage of a large screen and theatre surround sound, and nothing in it that warrants parting with $15 or $20 to see it just once, with antisocial louts making comments and crunching popcorn just behind you."	4.0	A good movie, but not necessarily a great movie.	2007-02-05	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1MSARPH08VX3I	Pharoah S. Wail	What an enchanting little movie this is! Amelie is almost a genre unto itself. Not content to just be a funny movie, or a movie about the thrill of new love, it combines both and mixes in a heaping helping of strangeness and random meaningless events to pull together a lovely picture of life as it really can be. It's harnessing all the meaningless little things of daily life into the swirling coherence of your life.In the big picture, I guess Amelie could be considered a romantic comedy, but it is so much more. It's a surreal slice of a France that alternately does and does not exist. It's the deep meaning of it all, as well as the utter meaninglessness of day-to-day life.Visually, it is a stunning achievement. If you pay attention to adults, or watch an hour of HGTV you'll soon realize that for some reason when most people grow up, their favorite colors somehow become tan and off-white. Amelie's world is one of color and joy, even in sadness. It's a world of hyper-natural color... the type of world within which every child would love to live.Audrey Tautou brought to life one of the singlemost memorable characters in movie history with her role as Amelie. The writing here is great, unique, and funny, but there is so much hilarious stuff Audrey can do just with a look that this still could have been an entertaining movie even if the writing had been much less inventive and funny. I recently picked up Dirty Pretty Things almost solely because Audrey is one its main characters. After Amelie, I just had to see her in more movies.If director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is ever able to top Amelie, that movie will certainly be another of the best films ever made.Experience Amelie for yourself.

Audrey Tautau is splendid in her role as Amelie, &amp; she carried the weight of the movie brilliantly.  The basis of the story was simple &amp; straight-forward, that they were many lost souls that needed to be saved, &amp; one day, Amelie decided that she would be THAT saviour.  The movie explained to us Amelie's deprived happy childhood &amp; as she grew up, she was a bit of an introvert &amp; she had difficulty in fitting in.  By doing those charitable deeds, Amelie redeemed herself &amp; she felt a sense of rejuvenation.  Deep down, though, she's still a lonely soul herself.  As the saying goes, what goes around comes around.  Those that she helped, they decided to help her in return &amp; they reminded her about the necessity of taking a risk to change her life for the better.  In other words, she's entitled to be happy just as much as they do, &amp; the ending doesn't disappoint.  The two hours spent is probably THE most wonderful two hours I spent this year.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3IUW081KXD3PE	pixels and bits	Audrey Tautou (The Davinci Code) evokes Audry Hepburn for me. This sweet film, based in Paris, follows the pursuit of love a young Parisian woman feels for a mysterious man she finds pictured in several novelty photograph booths. She gently inspires her father back to life by enlisting the aid of a flight attendant friend of hers to take her father's garden gnome with her on flights around the world. Pictures of the gnome in Russia and other exotic locals are sent back as postcards to the father who grows more perplexed about the adventures his gnome seems to be enjoying. Obviously, Travelocity was inspired enough by this movie to adopt the Traveling Gnome for their very own mascot!On a trip to Paris about a year after seeing this film for the first time I stumbled upon the small park that is featured in the film as a sort of puzzle/treasure hunt or the young would-be lovers.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AMQAG6BGFCIJS	Popescu Lucian	"Since there is no ""goodness"" except into people's minds, the whole idea of the movie tuns into pieces. A predominance of female supporters can easily be explained in the archetype of womanhood Amelie portrays. This is the ONLY plus in the movie. Accordingly, the average woman is utterly irrational and in order to avert responsibility of hers own acts, she typically sees herself as victim. To strengthen this self-indulgent image, she seeks company of other ""victims"" and frequently involves into ""humanitarian"" acts. The difference between Amelie and factual reality consists in HOW MUCH the victim-character is working to convey its true nature. Amelie is CRUCIADING against normality. She thinks having the right of intruding people's lives, being backed with such insight truly shameful not being shared with the rest of us, the poor unenlightened. She might be broadly classified as a crossover between the preaching evangelical and infamous ""civil rights activist"". (It's probably unnecessary to remind you how much I hate these sorry shacks of humans.)Outside of these considerations, Amelie is extremely long, absolutely boring, pleading for the beauty of ignorance devoid of responsibility, cheaply sentimental and FINALLY filled with recycled religion and postmodern rubbish."	1.0	i hated this movie	2002-09-07	53	13	40
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2CMYX10636NG2	Portia	I was so pleased with this movie! It tugged at my heartstrings the way fables and fairy-tales do. Indeed, the glorious cinematography kept an illustrative hue to the entire film.First things first, Audrey Tautou delivers a charming performance... she is much too-often compared with Audrey Hepburn, another small-faced gamine, but her aura is decidedly different. Where Hepburn was cool and chic, Tautou is childlike and imaginative. The film focuses a good deal on the colorful workings of her imagination and the fantasies it weaves.The tone of the film perfectly followed with Tautou's exuberant performance: the colors are sparkling and vivid, the scenery is slightly dream-like, the shots are appropriately quirky and surprising. This is not the real Paris, this is a memory of Paris.The narration and set-up of the films delightful cast of characters is very similar to The Royal Tennenbaums. I'm sorry to invoke a comparision here, but it is so striking that I have to say it. The narration is the kind you would find in a children's tale, and the characters are introduced by their likes and dislikes. Amelie approaches life with a wide-open fresh view that sees everything for the first time and the smallest of things are of the biggest importance.Amelie spends the whole film trying to bring happiness into others lives in imaginative ways. Ultimately, she must do the same for herself. The film's message is an uplifting one of innocence and optimism. Fairy-tale like, destiny always seems to take a large hand, and The Glass Man is the fairy godmother (father?) of the film, finally bestowing upon Amelie the courage to seek out happiness for herself.Viewers will find this lovely fable easy to relate to, as Amelie is such a fresh and unique character. We all have a bit of her spirit in us as well as her shyness to face happiness head-on.There are lots of great minor performances in this which add greatly to the local color. Amelie's knuckle-cracking coworker and her paranoid boyfriend who stalks her at work and makes notes of her every move into a portable tape recorder... The sad concierge at Amelie's apartment who loves and hates her dead cheating husband... Amelie's cold, serious father who longs to travel but never will... All these characters are magically helped by Amelie who seeks to breathe new life into their simple lives.This film will do the same for you. It is a joyful little modern fairy-story of chasing down true love when you find it.	5.0	whimsical and story-bookish	2003-07-20	10	8	2

The story of Amelie begins with the story of a sad lonely girl and evolves into that grown up girls emersion into a series of mysteries. What is so absolutely special about Amelie is that it asks us to find mystery and joy in the small things in life. Another important part of my love for Amelie is that it is visually stunning.

I assumed it to be one among the plethora of must see foreign movies that have come into the spotlight in more recent times. However, I was proved wrong.Amelie is a simple story told in a unique and stylish way. I am inclined to think that at least a part of its charm is to do with the fact that it is in French but this is just one little thing. I like the attention to detail in the film, the way the narrator introduces characters telling the audience his or her likes and dislikes.Tautou does a very good job, she is very comfortable in her character and is very well cast.	4.0	Really Good	2004-06-23	5	1	4
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3MZJNK0DYT0OM	Prof	I bought the DVD because the film is EXCELLENT. I would have given this 5 stars, except for the following things regarding the DVD production:1. There is neither English dubbing nor subtitles (THIS IS WHAT DVD IS ALL ABOUT), whereas I'm certain at least the latter was done for the film in the theaters. The interviews with the director are less important, and I didn't find them all that interesting anyway.2. There is advertisement for wines (I won't mention the name) throughout different parts of the CD (not during the film, thank goodness). For example, on my CD player I can't interrupt the opening commercial. Impossible to jump to the title screen. I'm obliged to watch it all the way until menu comes up.It's a shame that for such a good movie they had to package it so poorly.	3.0	Great film, disappointing packaging for a DVD	2003-01-23	2	0	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A319YRDK8Y39N	"""qmlhcb"""	Amelie is the girl's answer to Fight Club. Fusing the style and energy of that testosterone charged film with the cuteness of a chick flick; this French film is something everyone can enjoy.This story of a lonely girl becoming a do-gooder and eventually doing good for herself becomes a beautiful fantasy. It is a feel good movie without the usual audience manipulation tricks.If any one thing is a negative in this film, it is the lack of an English dubbing option. The debate over which way is the best to watch a film in a foreign language, dubbed or subtitles, comes down to personal preference. I personally like to see films both ways, subtitled to hear the vocal tones and inflections actors give, preserving the film as the director intended; and dubbed so I can watch the visuals while understand what's being said. This film has so many wonderful visuals, at times I felt I was missing a lot while hurriedly reading the subtitles. It's unfortunate the DVD didn't come with a choice of viewing.This is a great film, though, and well worth a spot on any film connoisseur's DVD shelf.	4.0	A stylistic fantasy	2002-08-15	5	3	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	Jean Pierre Jounet (City Of Lost Children) has directed and produced a superb French foreign film, one of the many that impressed audiences last year. Audrey Tautou portrays the selfless, vibrant heroine Amelie. Audrey Tautou somewhat resemebles Audrey Hepburn- her slim, girlish figure is perfectly toned, and the scenes in which she walks down the streets of Paris and in and out of cafes is very reminiscent of the late 50's actress. Jounet's film is an artistic arrangement of cinema and a small plotline. Many people have failed to truly see the magic of this film. It is not a &quot;chick flick&quot;, an &quot;artsy foreign film&quot; (although it can easily become that), it is a stunning film that's worth watching and enjoyed like an art museum.Amelie is the only daughter of an aging father, working as a waitress at a Paris restaurant. She awakens to her powers and begins to charitably assist other people and bring happiness to their lives. She is no longer merely a human girl, but part sprite, and the magic surrealism in the film is a lot like a Bunuel movie or Salvador Dali painting. The score to the film can hardly be labeled minimalism, but at times the repetitive French accordion waltzes remind one of minimalism. It is highly entertaining music, perfectly atmospheric of romance and the elegance of Paris.Personally, I was disappointed that during the Oscars last year, Amelie did not get the Best Foreign Film award (the award went to the Mexican film &quot;Y Tu Mama Tambien&quot;. Amelie rightly deserves recognition. It is a striking, beautiful film with a magnetic performance by Audrey Tautou, and cinematic magic by director Jean Pierre Jounet. If he comes up with more films like this, I will be sure to watch and perhaps this time around, audiences will be more appreciative.	5.0	Perfectly Artistic French Film	2003-02-28	3	3	0

In general, I very much agree with most of the reviews I've seen on here ... so you'd have little to gain from my yammering on about this wonderful movie.  However, one review that I read on here I hope is disregarded as utter rubbish.  The review I'm referring to dissed this movie as the characters (especially Am&eacute;lie) seemed ""childish"".  I would say that ""child-like"" would be a more appropriate description and I feel this only adds to the charm of the characters.  Am&eacute;lie lives in a very much ""adult"" world ... yet her subtle method of interacting with this world makes it seem quite innocent.  Basically, Am&eacute;lie is able to create a world that she is happy in.  If this is ""childish"" then I personally find such behaviour virtuous. (...)"	5.0	Why grow up?	2001-12-19	4	3	1

I had not seen it before but I recognized the actress, Audrey Tautou, from having seen her picture all over video stores in recent years.  I may be catching on late to a cult movie but better late than never.  Unlike other cult movies, this one is obviously popular because it's a great movie.  The gist of the story is a young woman who discovers something that gets her involved with bettering the lives of others.  In her efforts, she focusses entirely on the well-being of others to the disregard of herself.  In the end, she discovers that real happiness is not a vicarious experience but one in which you have to be personally involved.  Along the way is some of the funniest dialogue and hilarious plot twists that I have seen in years.  I believe this is a film that can be seen over and over with new discoveries each time.  It is in French (with subtitles) and anytime I was attending to something else, I wondered what gems I was missing.What a neat proposition; You can make a difference and have fun at the same time.

The great French director, Renoir, well he saw the disastrous 30's as a parable of misery.  And I was dodging Paris con men and not dodging prostitutes in the early 70's, but Amelie will have none of that cynicism.  No Socialist French nightmare of unbelievable unemployment and crappy free, healthcare for the young woman, Amelie.  She's in a fantasy world.I loved the warm colors of 19th century painter Renoir.  This is a movie that is a canvas-a-scene.  The dialogue is quirky; the scenes go by fade in, fade out, little odd twists and turns.  Fantasy animation scenes intermingle with romantic notions.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AFJFXN42RZ3G2	"R. DelParto ""Rose2"""	AMELIE is an enchanting film that Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates with artistic mastery.  The film depicts a young woman who grapples with her past but confronts her guileless shyness, and shows the psychological intricacies in her life where she intermingles those complexities with unpretentious encounters with others.  Amelie is almost like Alice in Wonderland.Audrey Tautou plays Amelie, a woman who suffered traumatic experiences during her childhood with the death of her mother, the loss of her goldfish, and a father who keeps a sanctuary for his wife and has a fetish for ceramic gnome figures.  Then suddenly, after watching news reports about Princess Diana's death, and by accident, finding a little cubbyhole in her bathroom, which has hidden a box of someone's childhood treasures, she believes it is an epiphany to do virtuous deeds and to find the rightful owner of the box.Jeunet shows a montage of humorous quick cuts and quirky facial expressions.  The film is lively and fast-paced with a tinge of subtle moments.  An interesting part of the film shows Amelie and her neighbor, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), though during individual occasions, watching TV and flipping from one channel to the next where in several instances they view unusual vintage clips, such as a black woman playing an electric guitar with a gospel choir in the background and a man dancing a jig with his wooden leg on what looks like a southern dirt road as well as reflections of their own lives; the images are somewhat surreal and dream-like, but may possibly speak towards a type of inventiveness on the part of the participants in the scenes.The film is enticing with an array of fascinating colors and images that should be contributed to the impeccable cinematography and artwork.  Indeed, it has a Salvador Dali-quality, and also captures a picturesque French landscape, which looks like a framed portrait.  The animated portion of the film is charming.  In addition, the musical score contains various moods from a music box to a pumping accordion, which evokes the French ambience that weaves in an out of the film.The two-disc DVD is an interesting package, which includes bonus and background material about the film.  Viewers have the chance to understand the story behind the making of the film with several interviews of Jeunet and the actors and discussion of the storyboard.  In addition, there are screen tests of Audrey Tautou, Urban Cancelier (Collignon--The Grocer), and Yolanda Moreu (Madeleine Wallace--Concierge) and the film's trailer.If you are looking for a unique and unpredictable film, I recommend AMELIE.  It will make you smile.	5.0	"""Luck is like the Tour de France"""	2007-03-04	4	4	0

I was especially delighted for that reason.I don't remember the last time I laughed so much while watching a movie. In fact, maybe it was when watching ""What About Bob."" Which proves psychological hilarity does appeal to my sense of humor to the extreme.First you have two obsessive compulsive parents who never fully develop into characters you can admire or dislike. They simply exist in this movie as some sort of semblance of balance for the dysfunctional life Amelie (Audrey Tautou ) has woven her fragile existence between until her parents are torn apart by death. For the first part of her life, she is not shown normal affection and finally retreats into her own imagination. Deprived of love and basic childhood pleasures, like friends, Amelie lacks social skills in various areas, while she seems to survive working as a waitress in an eccentric caf&eacute;.One day her life changes. She is watching the news and is so shocked by the revelation she drops something that rolls to a bathroom tile, that reveals a hidden treasure. She vows to return the treasure to the original owner.There is something beautiful about Amelie's character. She embodies an innocence long forgotten and therefore her vindictive side in regards to the corner grocer will have you rolling on the floor. The man (Mathieu Kassovitz) she falls for is of course even more eccentric than she is and well, he works in a place that might not delight you and there are a few seconds here and there of adult naughtiness. They could have left out the dancer and the shop where he works because technically those items are not really woven well into the story. A more hilarious view is taken of sex in this movie and there are no serious love scenes to be sure. His character is not fully developed and they focus more on Amelie's life and longings.Amelie sees herself as an angel/avenger. Half the time she is helping the eccentric characters find their way to happiness, while the hilarity comes from her attempts to ""teach"" other rather rude characters a good lesson. Then Amelie sends her father's garden gnome all over the world and this inspires him to travel. She seems to inspire others to follow their dreams.In the process she discovers that having heart only shows her half the real picture in life. She needs a soul mate to complete her. Being the completely innocent character she is, she would of course find someone who is rather a nonconformist in a way. He spends some of his time collecting torn up pictures from a photo booth and is seeking to solve the mystery of his life. Who is the man who keeps appearing to have his picture taken?Watch for a moment of pure spectacular creativity when water splashes all over the floor. There are artistic moments of bliss in this movie!Nostalgic in places and poignant scenes that will catch you off guard as you find yourself suddenly crying and maybe relating to Amelie in some intimate way as you realize that you too have had dreams that didn't always come true just when you wanted them to.Completely modern movie making and has academic nuances here and there to delight the poet in you. A cozy Parisian Soundtrack is included to match.A similar experience to watching Moulin Rouge because you have an intense desire to watch this over and over again. I think it is just so visually stimulating and the details can hardly be absorbed in one viewing.A feel good movie that leaves you with a sense thatthere is still beauty and sweet innocence left somewhere in the world.Or maybe that is just a fantasy...~The Rebecca Review"	5.0	Compulsively Comic	2002-07-30	17	14	3
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2PTWKZ2VKD2D0	"Red Moose ""Mark"""	Am&eacute;lie is by turns a black comedy and a quirky romance. The storyline is the ever-familiar boy-meets-girl/girl-meets-boy, although the writing is refreshingly free from clich&eacute;s.The movie introduces us to Am&eacute;lie, her family, and her coworkers in a rather original way, with a narrator describing them as they appear. The script throughout the movie is incredibly succinct and descriptive. The characters are described with only a few words, but are so well portrayed in those brief moments that I found it almost poetic in its depth. Not that the language is especially flowery; just insightful. The dialogue is similarly well done and there is often more than just one layer in the conversations.The characters are fantastic; real and conveying a lot of depth. Each actor plays his or her role very convincingly and much of the humour is so good because the characters are so well-played.The cinematography is also very good, and the sets are wonderfully warm and fit well with the movie's feel. Much of the camera work is shot with a wide-angle lens. Thus almost all of the scenes have at least a little bit of background in them. For me this helped immerse me more fully in the movie, as though I was really there.There are some very funny moments in this film, with two scenes among the most hilarious of any I have ever watched. For such clever comedy it is also quite subtle; you are not beaten over the head with a punchline, and there aren't really any running jokes, as such. Well, there is one, but it changes in each of the three times it occurs in order to place the emphasis on slightly different aspects.As has been stated in other reviews, there are some risqu&eacute; elements to this movie, so it would not be appropriate for young children. It's more that the scene flashes up for a few seconds in relation to what Amglie is thinking and then disappears - that sort of thing. Also, the inside of a sex shop is part of a couple of scenes. But the movie doesn't engage in lengthy sex scenes that involve the main characters.I highly recommend this movie for everyone interested in quirky romantic-comedies.	5.0	Tr&eacute;s Magnifique!	2005-01-28	3	2	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2MN6GVCI5U4F1	R. Fox	I found this film to be so good that it was almost unwatchable.  The sheer delight, sadness, joy, elation, humour and down-right fantastic entertainment value of this film is overwhelming.  Audrey Tautou's performance is breath-taking, and she will steal your heart as much as any fine performances in the history of cinema will have done before.It's like a re-birth for your faith in cinema.  If you feel that cinema is a dying art, this will prove it's still alive and kicking.  If you believe cinema is alive and kicking, you won't know how hard until you see this.The story is simple, but perfect - a love story set against the most ridiculous and charming of obstacles.  The innocence of this movie shines through with Amelie's bashful and wonderful pursuit of her 'Love At First Sight', her whimsical and definitely child-like take on anything that we may consider routine or tradition, and the mockery of every day life is so funny that it could never, ever be offensive, even to the most hardened creature of routine.If you liked Delicatessen, you will simply adore this.  If you just like films that make you feel alive, or happy, or joyful or all of the above, watch this film and be amazed.	5.0	Perilously good	2001-11-12	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A12X2J7AVZ04IQ	"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan"""	This is a film of exquisite beauty, for eye, ear, mind and heart. The plot is simple, but some of the insights are mind-blowing! Quite profound! The use of color has rarely been so magnificent, and it all is SO important to understanding where sweet Amelie is coming from. Lovely fantasy stuff, mixed with the real world. I avoided seeing this film, but I borrowed the 2-disc version from the library, and was thoroughly entertained. Audrey Tautou reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn, as well as Julia Roberts...without trying to imitate them. She's endearing. All of the supporting roles were done with conviction and strength, especially Mathieu Kassowitz, as the object of her obsession. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, like some of our other GREAT directors (Scott, Cameron, Fincher) got his big break directing an &quot;Alien&quot; film. The second disc tells that he was so upset with the Hollywood process and lack of artistic control, that he's gone somewhat independent since then. He's given us wonderful stuff like &quot;Delcatessen&quot;. It's a sweet story, but if you're into visual art, be sure to see this film. Also, the music of Vann Tiersen will draw you more and more into this fantasy.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1R7RSAMR1ST5M	R.M.	From the very beginning, Am&eacute;lie shows itself to be different from predictable American blockbusters.  Its opening sequence, the retelling of the salient points of Am&eacute;lie's childhood (according to her delightfully skewed view), draws the viewer into her sweet little world with its clever script and beautiful cinematography. We learn all about her parent's small quirks; her father, for instance, hates the feeling of wet swimming shorts sticking to his legs but thoroughly enjoys polishing his shoes to a deep shine, while her mother detests the wrinkled hands that come from bathing too long while finding great pleasure in empting out and reorganizing her purse. Amelie lives in a world where everyone can be categorized by such small but vitally important facts, and every little deed has its own reward.Am&eacute;lie spends her days in two activities, for she is both a waitress and a doer of good deeds. A decided introvert, the heroine delights in interesting ways of relating and interacting with the world which might not occur to the more literal minded. Much of the film is spend detailing the whimsical ways she discovers and carries out the most fantastical wishes of those unrecognized worthies that live around her. And in the midst of her small philanthropic acts, Am&eacute;ile thinks about about the mysterious man whose photo album she acquires when it falls right off his pannier, and plans how she might get in contact with him. The end, of course, is no surprise to anyone except Am&eacute;lie; though expected, it lacks not one bit of charm, and the seducer becomes the seduced in a beautiful turn of roles.The Paris shown is not a gritty city but rather the City of Lights as the dreamers might see it, and the enhancement of reality is perfect for the new view of the world it gives. We might see the world through Amelie's eyes, and thank goodness for it: I never knew the world could look this bright, nor the colors so sharp and dazzling. The little integration of computer animation that does occur is both unexpected and seamless, delighting in its whimsical nature. This movie is a treasure from all perspectives, and I look forward to seeing both past and future efforts from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.	5.0	A colorful look inside a beautiful world	2002-11-20	11	10	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"Amelie (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001)For the past two years, I have been reading reviews of Amelie that all have one thing in common: the word ""sweet."" I have no idea what film these people were watching, but it wasn't the twisted little minor gem I saw on Sunday night. ""Sweet"" may be the last word I'd have come up with in trying to describe it. I should have had more faith in the brilliance of Jeunet. (Of course, all of these same people persist in describing Audrey Tatou as anything from ""pixie-like"" to ""gorgeous,"" as well. I found her rather disturbing-looking, as I find everyone in Jeunet films.)Throw the other reviews out and listen to me, will you? Amelie is the story of the title character (Audrey Tatou of Venus Beauty Institute), and there's actually precious little story. It's more a slice-of-life thing, during which she does such things as befriend a man with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Serge Melin of The City of Lost Children), try to set up some of her compatriots at work, torments the local grocer Collignon (Michel Robin, presently onscreen in America in Merci pour le Chocolat), and lead a hopelessly lovestruck guy from her grade-school class (Matthieu Kassovitz, from Jakob the Liar) on a wild goose chase to discover her identity. None of which is all that sweet a thing to do, really.Jeunet's usual twisted sense of humor is evident here, and it rears its head often in visual clues (think Police Squad! for a more highbrow audience). The wit isn't as dry as usual, and thus the movie doesn't have as many laugh-out-loud funny points as Jeunet's finest film, Delicatessen. That doesn't make it unwatchable, but it does pale in comparison. Just be prepared to find a movie filled with subtly disturbing (especially in their appearance) people that will leave you scratching your head and wondering ""what in the world was all that about?"" ***"	3.0	"""Sweet?""

This is French cinema at its best and you certainly won't need to uncork `89 La Fitte Rothschild to let this one captivate your spirit.  Amelie is a warm and life affirming film that proves that no matter what station in life we hold we can engage ourselves and make life worth living on the most profound levels and then find true happiness.  Think this sounds like a fairy tale? Well just sit back and watch you'll see what I mean.As the film opens up we see a younger version of Amelie and her friendless life and through the dynamic hues of the filming and dreamy French music we get an idea for what we are in for.  The cinematography is fantastic and if nothing else, watch the movie just to see how beautiful Paris can be.  As the film progresses we see Amelie in ""the present"" she is still detached and after finding a box of old things begins performing random acts of kindness from afar.  The big question is she going interact with the world on a personal level and ever find what is missing in her life.I really liked this film but I will admit that it requires a child-like naivet&eacute; to watch at some points but the lovely feel of this movie does its best to make this easy on the viewer with its soundtrack and use of CGI.

While the viewer knows in his or her heart that Paris never really looked this clean or beautiful, the film nevertheless manages to delight every second of its 122 minute run time.  The colors, the light, the imagery, the fantasy:  all blends together to entrance and excite the viewer.  In this way, the film harkens back to the earliest films made, those by another resident of Paris, Lumiere.  There was no real point to those little films except to startle and delight the viewer, and in that sense the film follows very much in that tradition.Audrey Tautou is a wonder!  I hope that she makes very many films.  She is utterly adorable, and a delight to look at with her black hair and apparently matching eyes.  With a lesser actress, this film might have been fun to look at, but would not have engaged the viewer emotionally.  As it is, we care very much for her to find happiness in addition to helping others to find it, because we come to like her.  The rest of the cast was also very enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed Serge Merlin as &quot;The Glass Man,&quot; socalled because he has especially brittle bones.  The film conceit of having him constantly work on hyperrealistic copies of paintings of Renoir works marvelously, though he shouts so loudly a couple of times that I was surprised that he didn't break a couple of ribs.Everything in this film conspires to make it an enjoyable experience.  Visually, as I have mentioned, it is utterly stunning.  The cinematography and the art direction is just extraordinary.  I loved the soundtrack, and for the hour or two after seeing this the strains of the accordion kept playing through my head.All in all, this is as enjoyable a piece of eye candy as I have encountered in a long, long time.  It is as visually arresting as another recent film set in Paris, MOULIN ROUGE, but I personally found the film as a whole far more enjoyable.	5.0	Delightful and enchanting candy for the eye and heart	2002-07-28	2	1	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A20W0JPHS8M96W	Roberto Carvalho De Magalhaes	I had seen the movie a couple of times in the past and loved it. I ordered the blue-ray disc to show the movie to my spouse that hadn't ever seen it. Well, even if I knew already the story, the characters, the places, and even remembered passages of the dialogues, watching it again was a great delight. The unusual Amelie is a beautiful story of diversity. Strongly recommended for those who praise diversity and freedom - and, maybe, a lesson for those who don't!	5.0	Beautiful story of diversity	2013-02-07	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A399695IIMZR23	"Robert Tarantino ""TSSINTMovie"""	"First let me say that I own the DVD. When I saw that it had become available on Blu-ray I ordered it. As you can probably tell it is an import from Australia. Because of this, the case is slightly thicker than a normal case. The movie comes as a single disc.The audio/video transfer was well executed, the movie was gorgeous to begin with, and it's nice to see they managed not to mess this up (unlike ""Hero"").The only reason for the 4 stars was that the extras are not 1080p and as a result will not play on my PS3 so I won't be enjoying those.As with the original, the movie is in French with English subtitles.As for the movie, very briefly, it is the story of a young woman who goes on a mission to help others despite her own problems.If I were to classify the story, I'd say romantic comedy with a side of fantasy.It is an adult movie so there is some nudity, for those who have not seen it.If you've seen the movie, then you already know this, the jump to blu-ray was worth the $34, for me anyway.However, as always, rent it first (as a DVD most likely) and decide for yourself."	5.0	Love This Movie	2009-11-29	1	1	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	"Audrey Tautou is the shy, pixieish ""AMELIE"" in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's magical romantic comedy that has garnered nearly unanimous rave reviews wherever it has played.And yes, it really is that good.Gamin-like and wide-eyed, Tautou bears more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Audrey Hepburn and she is perfect in the part of a lonely waitress who accidentally discovers a small box of what must be a former tenant's childhood treasures behind a loose tile in the bathroom of her apartment in the Montmartre section of Paris. Even though the items obviously have no monetary value, she sets out to discover who hid them and return the decades old object to their rightful owner.  The strategies involved and the resulting success give her such a warm feeling she sets out to continue her acts of selfless kindness whenever the opportunity presents itself.  Along the way, she is surprised to discover that her needs and wants are being met and she has found someone to love that just might love her in return.  Naturally she plays out the game in the most charming of ways.Jeunet, in an interview in the supplemental material, says this story has been in his head for more than twenty years.  And it shows in the nuanced details of every shot.  The fluid cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel perfectly matches the smooth flow of the constantly surprising story with sequences carefully composed and choreographed to underscore the emotion of every scene.Furthermore, the entire film has been digitally tinted to match the patina hued paintings -- with splashes of red and spots of blue -- of a favorite Brazilian artist of the director.In our cynical age of irony as entertainment, there's something special about experiencing a movie that reminds us of the sublime pleasure inherent in ""treating others as we wish to be treated.""  Make no mistake, this is not a message film, it's not preachy and neither is it a chick flick.  But rather a deeply beautiful film that charms on such a high level that it puts in proper perspective the dreck that poses as entertainment almost everywhere we turn.Don't miss this marvelous film.  It will resonate in your heart and mind for a long time."	5.0	INSTANT CLASSIC A MUST SEE	2002-07-17	6	4	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3OBYG5N0BM7B9	Rocko	This movie was recommended to me by a friend who had traveled the world and was also a waitress so I can understand how she could relate to it. I enjoy films of all calibers especially french! and especially anything done under canal+.So here I go watching this movie and the way it's put together is amazing, camera work, the set design, the acting, everything looks beautiful but film is not just to make pretty images, a story is also important. I noticed myself getting bored and drifting off every 20 minutes or so, not because I can't get with intellectual dialogue or follow a side story but there was no real conflict or turning point that mattered to our main character.Amelie is very pretty indeed, and the movie LOOKS great, but can I watch a girl just walking around being nice for 2 hours? no and when she does find something that interests her it becomes a game for her instead of a challenge, so if she's got it all figured out whats her problem?Yes I would rank it under pseudo-intellectual, it's not 100% trash but I'd never watch it again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, there are better films that show you pretty things and maintain an actual storyline.	2.0	Who cares if she looks like Audrey Hepburn	2014-01-22	2	1	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3UF2M9P5T915J	Rodney Basconcillo	"I watched Amelie on DVD several years ago for fun, and really enjoyed it. Then a few weeks ago I finally ordered my own DVD and watched it again. It's great to watch even a second time thru, probably because it's hard to catch everything the first time. And that's because many of the good parts of Amelie are very brief, especially in the first 20 minutes or so when Amelie's childhood & teenhood are shown in a pretty fast pace. Just like how the official summary of the movie describes Amelie, she is ""painfully shy"" but also playful & enthusiastic with her eccentric hobbies, like skipping stones (as well as ""stealing"" nice skipping stones throughout the movie XD), and helping people out.As for the content of the movie, the story has some elements of intrigue & mystery, and with the shy-yet-mischievous Amelie character wanting to do things in her indirect ways, a lot of light-hearted action takes place while these little ""mysteries"" are solved. Overall it starts off as a comedy, with bits of adult content (brief showings of nude breasts & non-explicit sex scenes), a few fun fantasy elements like inanimate photos & animal-objects talking to her, and gradually turns into a light, adorable romantic comedy in the 2nd half. She and her love interest are based on a curious crush on each other, with their main goal being to simply find out more of each other, without meeting, yet. XD (As opposed to typical romantic comedies where the main characters hook up, fight, get back together, have dramas, then FINALLY get back together.)Another thing to note about this movie is the presentation. The style is very artistically composed, with colors being selected & saturated to get an almost toy-like world in some scenes. The various characters have distinct personalities, from an obnoxiously bossy vendor to a quiet, wise painter.Overall, people who are tired of typical romantic comedies will like how eccentric this movie is. Shy/quiet people will relate to Amelie's interests & personality, as this is a very ""character-driven"" movie."	5.0	2nd time viewing..	2008-10-03	3	3	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ	Rodrigo Llamozas	Am&egrave;lie (Le fabouleux destin d'Am&egrave;lie Poulain) is the kind of film you just can't find in Hollywood. It's enchanting, magical and gorgeous, with a very endearing story, very imaginative visuals and the perfect actress in the perfect role.Am&eacute;lie (played by the lovely Audrey Tautou, `Dirty pretty things') is a young woman living by herself in Paris, working as a waitress in a caf&eacute;. On the day that Princess Diana's death she finds an old toy box behind her bathroom tiles, and she decides to look for the man who used to own those toys - if he's moved by this discovery, she will dedicate her life to helping others be happier. Obviously, the man breaks into tears at the realization that his long lost, boyhood treasures return to him, so Am&eacute;lie embarks in many a project to help her father, her neighbors, friends and co-workers find happiness.However, Am&eacute;lie herself is not really happy, as she has not found true love yet. She needs a man who shares her dreams and her outlook on life. Thus appears Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz, `Birthday girl', director of `Gothika' with Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz, and `The Crimsom rivers' with Jean Reno), a weird young man who collects torn photomat pictures, discarded by unsatisfied costumers. Am&eacute;lie follows Nino and tries to arrange for him to meet her, in one of the most romantic cat &amp; mouse games you'll ever see.Director's Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ('City of lost children', 'Delicatessen')use of colors and unusual camera angles give an incredible visual styling to this movie, and enhance the magical elements of the story. Another gorgeous element of this movie is it's soundtrack. Yann Tiersen's use of the accordion gives the music much of its Parisian feel.Nominated for five Academy Awards (although it didn't win any of them), including Cinematography, Foreign Language Film, Art Direction, Sound and Original Screenplay, Am&eacute;lie is a movie you'll want to share with a loved one, and that you'll cherish for all your life.	5.0	Simply enchanting!	2003-12-22	5	3	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2BIAR1V0PWO27	"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S..."	Although this is not my normal fair I thought the views of Paris might be entertaining at least!  This flick has all the cute, charming French touches that we have come to expect from their movies.  I found the movie more than a bit choatic, and a bit too quirky at times.  Honestly, if women aspire to be this kind of frustrated, confused woman then they will have an even harder time relating to the dense male sex!  No woman could expect to get anywhere with Amelie's confused outlook on things.  Yes, its cute, but also obnoxious after a while.  I think the movie also suffered from being overly long.  90 minutes would have been more than adequate for a cute, quirky romance like this. Not over 2 hours! I suppose its interesting to see Parisians as screwed up as say New Yorkers in their urban lives, but how much of this do we have to see?!  Perhaps the charm of things French has been dimed lately because of their arrogant politics toward the US in Iraq.  Its hard to say, or maybe my Criossant was a bit stale when I saw this epic!  I really couldn't say, but I think there are far better French movies out there than Amelie for sure.  The views of Paris were nice anyway.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AAGFBE5EM7YKB	Roule Duke	...But this delightfull French film totally turned me around on the possiblities of the romantic comedy genre.The story of Amelie concerns the title character as she sets out to bring happiness to those around her by very subtle and inventive means rather than trying to repair her own solitary life. The film is surprising and creative from start to finish, so I won't spoil the rest of the story as when I first saw the film I had no idea what to expect and don't want to ruin that first time veiwing experience for anyone else. You just don't know what to expect from one scene to the next in this film, as opposed to Hollywood romantic comedies where the stories are cliched and predictable.Besides the genuinely refreshing originality of Amelie, the film contains an amazing visual style which blends cgi effects into the picture flawlessly and with much great effect and purpose than any of the big budget Hollywood flicks. The music is also great with a main theme which has that really French feel about it. Audrey Tautou is amazing in this film as well, she makes Amelie beleivable and endears her character to the audience in every screen moment. Subtitles work great with this film too as even though I can only speak some basic phrases in French, Audrey Tautou gives Amelie an charming soft impish type voice that would be lost if it was dubbed and but can still be appreciated by anyone who doesn't speak the language. People who refuse to watch subtitled films are losers anway....P>The only negative thing I could say about Amelie is that theres a real danger that the geniuses in Hollywood might try to remake it much the same way they remade the brilliant and highly origingal Japanse horror masterpiece 'Ringu' into the silly shallow 'Ring'. Other than that Amelie is a wonderous one of a kind film that doesn't come by very often.	5.0	Perfect film!	2003-07-02	2	1	1

I throughly enjoyed this film from it's photographic and sometimes surreal scenes to the interesting dialog. I am not apart of this silly, brainless anti-France kick. This film was a reminder that the best American films of which I have enjoyed were in a similar vein of being anti-linear and woven into a complex thread of scenes and events.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2I1UGAN0M9DZZ	Sandro Menzel	This is a great, light-hearted romantic comedy that I really enjoyed. The story is about a quirky young French woman, Amelie, who fixes other people's lives and ends up fixing her own. The story-telling was a bit out of the ordinary and done so quite humorously. After watching Amelie, I doubt I'll view new character introductions quite the same.Keep in mind that this is a French movie with English subtitles so you'll have to pay attention to the movie if you want to follow what's going on.I would definitely watch this one again. There were subtleties that I probably missed while reading the subtitles. Besides, it's a good, funny story that's well done.Oh, and be sure to check out the special features. Audrey Tautou's audition is priceless.Recommend: YesWatch again: Yes	4.0	Funny, Romantic Comedy	2003-04-11	5	5	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	AC33KEAREAVOT	"SarahCM ""Sarah!"""	"Amelie tells the story of a young woman named, surprisingly, Amelie, who lives alone in the district of Montmartre, Paris. She is intensely introverted and loves exploring the lives of others from a distance and piecing together facts about them, especially during her job as a waitress. In the end, she finds love-- but I won't give too much of this amazing movie away!!!Amelie is a film that could be classified as ""cute"", but the delivery of the lines keep the emotions genuine and entirely plausible. The end is predictable in the way that all love stories are, but the small stories that the movies explore along the way (i.e. other romances, etc.) keep it highly entertaining. Amelie is often very funny as well, in a subtle and whimsical way.Those who appreciate good cinematography will love this movie also; the angles of the camera, the colors of the costumes and the sets, and the warm filters portray a nostalgic Paris that you will find yourself longing for even if the thought of visiting France has never entered your mind.Basically, this is a movie that everyone can appreciate!!!

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB	"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First"""	"Am&eacute;lie was the most charming, unusual and totally unexpected film I`ve ever had the pleasure to see. It features a quirky cast of characters, beautiful and unusual cinematography, a magnificent soundtrack, and an original, magical story.The film begins with a random, startling voiceover: ""On September 3, 1973, at 6:28 pm and 32 seconds, a bluebottle fly capable of 14 670 wingbeats a minute lands on St. Vincent Street, Montmartre."" We are introduced to the other characters by a similar stringing together of tidbits of information that form a giddy bubbly necklace: the cat enjoys listening to children's stories, Joseph, spurned lover of Suzanne, owner of the Two Windmills and ex-circus rider, likes popping bubble wrap, Raphael Poulain likes stripping wallpaper but dislikes clingy swim trunks, Nino Quincompoix, employee at the Porno Palace who collects torn up photographs from under photo booths, Lucien, grocer's assistant who is slow with words but quick with smiles, Monsieur Dufayel, an old man born with brittle bones who shields himself from reality in his padded apartment, painting the same Renoir over and over again.We see Am&eacute;lie grow up before our very eyes, raised by a strict father who never hugs or touches Am&eacute;lie, who yearns for contact. Flash forward to the future: Am&eacute;lie is now a waitress at the Two Windmills Caf&eacute; in Montmartre. Her wide brown eyes and mischievous smile lend her a pixyish air. We could all learn a thing or two from Am&eacute;lie: smile frequently, and do something nice for someone to brighten their day. Her life changes forever on the morning that Princess Di's death was announced to the world, and the rest of the film follows her adventures. Am&eacute;lie's world is one of magic, one where pictures talk and objects come to life.The cinematography is equally jarring, switching from handheld camera to vintage footage to pieced-together photos to animations and back. The film has a sepia wash that gives it an aged appearance, adding to its charm. The soundtrack, composed by Breton Yann Tiersen, is quintessentially Parisian: accordion waltzes accompanied by the rather unexpected sound of typewriters and music boxes. Piano plays a central role in the scoring, and some of the songs are vintage oldies, record hiss and all, others have gypsy flair. Buy the soundtrack if you have a chance, you will not regret it. It is a melodious blend of classical, Parisian bistro and film music that will stay in your ears for days.If you're looking for a break from everyday drudgery, look no further than Am&eacute;lie. Her magic is contagious and will brighten your day."	5.0	Let Am&eacute;lie bring magic into your life!	2002-02-26	30	27	3

B0000640VO	Amelie	AEM0D3OFOR9RQ	Sara	Pour moi, this film is the gift that keeps on giving. A sweet, romantic and inspiring modern classic, this French film is like comfort food. If a bad day is plaguing you, pop this one in and revel in its instant catharsis. Starring doe-eyed, instantly charming Audrey Hepburn incarnate Audrey Tautou as the shy but quirky main character, the viewer is instantly transported into her delicately colored, imaginative world. Amelie leads a quiet life, working as a waitress in a restuarant filled with dysfunctional characters, occasionally caring for her friend's cat and indulging in simple pleasures. Then one fateful day, her life changes forever. Upon finding a childhood keepsake and returning it to the owner, she becomes a secret guardian angel to the people around her. But while she can make others happy, she just can't seem to make things click with handsome stranger Nino (the talented and good looking Mathieu Kassovitz). The story plays out in a magical Parisan backdrop that only adds to the story's charm. The film is slow, sweet torture when it comes to the unfolding romance between Amelie and Nino, but when it gets to the climax, you can't help feeling amazing. Even when I watch this for the 100th time I get that heart-pumping, mind-blowing feeling of true love. So make a list of your likes and dislikes and indulge.	5.0	A film to truly cherish	2002-08-16	34	33	1

Even ones who don't know a word of French and have to read the subtitles love this movie- even ones who would otherwise refuse to watch any movie with subtitles. The theme and plot are lovely, like poetry, and Amelie is fit to inspire with her subtly witty and perfected art manipulation. Most of the time, she barely even needs to say a word, and Audrey Tautou's impish manner is perfect for the part.	5.0	A ray of shining light on the French cinema horizon	2002-10-13	2	1	1

Her good deeds are charming and pure.  Yet you see a note of mischeviousness in her eyes.

I've grown tired of waiting and given the positive reviews of this Australian release, I decided to give it a try despite the reports that I may not be able to view the PAL contents.  I figured as long as I could watch the movie it would be worth it.  To my surprise, my Pioneer BD player/TV played all the content with no problems!The presentation on this Australian BD release looks gorgeous.  The DTS-MA track also sounds terrific.  Apparently there was another release (Canadian?) that got some negative reviews because the transfer wasn't that great; glad I didn't get that one.The only reason I didn't give this BD release 5 stars is the extra content was lacking IMO.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1	"Savant11 ""Savant11"""	This was a cute and interesting little film. Very original in the method of the telling of the story. It has been  mentioned that this film is an updated version of the Hally Mills film Pollyanna. In that the heroine goes about making other people happy but neglects herself.  I found it very interesting how Amelie is interested in living other peoples lives but is too afraid of living her own life and accepting love. Mostly because of the rejection from her Parents. The entire story is told in a funny quirky way. I also liked the scenery and the cinematography everything was set in an almost glowing gold. Which reflected Amelie's (fantasy) view of the world as being happy and shinningHowever, and this is the reason for the 4 stars, Some elements of the film where a major turn off. Such as the endless sex jokes and the scenes of people performing coitus. That was just unecessary and overdone--when I want to see that kind of stuff I'll rent a porno. Not that there is anything wrong with sex in movies. Just as long as it is called for. But not in this instance,  I felt that it was just thrown in for titilation purposes. And it really marred the film.Other than that Amelie was an ejoyable film and one of the bright spots in the lackluster 2001 film year.	4.0	Interesting but...	2002-06-13	12	5	7
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	As far as foreign films go, I don't have a lot of viewing hours devoted; most of my viewing pleasure has been with American Hollywood.  Amelie may change that for me!After Run Lola Run, a German film with non-stop action and tons of allegory, I wanted a film that would fit the same bill and Amelie was clearly that:  fun acting, interesting allegory, some very strange scenes and several themes.The film throws a few curves, gives information that has nothing to do with the film's plot but apparently was thrown in for fun.  The fact that a bluebottle fly buzzes by a table where, unnoticed, two glasses of wine are dancing on a table cloth is interesting curiosa but the narrator makes it sound so important.Grown up with a worrisome, unaffectionate father and a very strange mother, (who oddly gets killed by someone jumping off a church tower! - Happens every day, right?) Amelie is a shy person who does not know how to deal with people in general.  But she's very clever.After finding a hidden box of boy's stuff, filled with jacks, photos and all, she manages to find the person whose box it belonged to from some 40 years before.  After much adventure, she manages to find him and creates creative ways to get it to him without knowledge of benefactor.She succeeds!  After this, it's her goal to make life happier for others.  With the help of a recluse painter, she comes to realize that her life would be better if, rather than being a do-gooder, that she really should help herself too.The film is quite imaginative.  She fails at meeting the person she loves, turns to water and SPLASH!  She does not really become water of course - it was metaphor.  These kinds of scenes are peppered throughout the film.Amelie is billed as a romantic comedy.  It's comedic for sure, but it is more a story of her confrontation with life, her realization that she's creating her own barriers to happiness and the adventure of overcoming these.  The wild actions she engages in to avoid contact with her crush are just hilarious.Audrey Tautou is perfect as the shy girl with big eyes and clever lines.Highly recommended, although the film is a bit too long and has enough sex and nudity to keep it in the R rated category.	5.0	Ooh La La!	2010-09-22	2	2	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1CBUBHJP1CQLJ	Scott David Smith	"This movie was the inspiration for the Travelocity gnome and (my opinion) the TV show called Pushing Daisies. It is a French film about love and longing and philosophy with lots of voice-overs and it is impossible to describe except to say that it is ""happening as though it were the here-and-now"", so it's an existentialist and in-the-now sort of gestalt experience to watch this film. It presents a philosophy of life that I agree with, an in-the-moment sort of improvisation that recommends itself to me (and I recommend living in the moment as much as possible) but talks about consequences.This is also a very humorous and uplifting film, with lots of silly games being played by young and hormonally tricked out adults who are looking for love but are a little too introverted to be brave. The point of the film is that only the (eventually) brave ones find happiness. Taking chances is what life is all about...you only have one chance so you better take it soon!"	5.0	One of my favorite movies	2007-10-13	4	4	0

I've seen some bad reviews on this site that compared Amelie's cat and mouse game with Nino with the antics of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fud.  Maybe they missed the begining of the movie or decided that reading the subtitles was not important to understand what was happening.  Amelie's inability to confront Nino can easily be explained by her childhood and it's lack of social contact.  Simply put, this is a beautiful film full of imagination that will leave you with a smile on your face.  If you can get over the fact that you have to read subtitles for the 2 hours that this film spans then this is a must see.  Please watch it twice, read the subtitles the first time so that you know what is going on, the second time pay more attention to Amelie and the wonderful performance that Audrey Tautou gives.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	&quot;Amelie&quot; is the most wonderfully charming film I have ever seen.  It's quite possible that, upon reflection, I'll consider this to be hyperbole inspired by a recent viewing, and I'll give &quot;Amelie&quot; a more reserved rating, like &quot;it's one of the best films I've ever seen.&quot;&quot;Amelie&quot; tells the story of the title character, played with a seeming impossible combination of daring, reserve, romanticism, idealism, and fear by Audrey Tautou.  In a performance where she is speaks very little (one of her struggles is that she is an observer of life who must eventually find a way to &quot;live&quot; her life rather than watch it go by), Tautou nevertheless steals the show.Well, almost, 'cause the city of Paris gives her a run for her money.  If you are a fan of Paris, you will absolutely love this film.  Lovingly shot, the film gives us a Paris that is so perfect that it cannot exist in real life.  Colors are slightly exaggerated through clever filters and lighting, and the charming little details (such as the elaborate cursive menu on a restaurant window) are evocative of the film's romantic spirit.One of the most original plots in years, &quot;Amelie&quot; tells the story of a woman who has always sat on the sidelines.  As a child, Amelie was so nervous when her reserved father touched her (only during medical examinations) that her pulse raced, leading to the misdiagnosis of a hyperactive heart.  As Amelie grows into womanhood, she has always sat and observed, and with a wonderful imagination has created an alternate universe for herself.  This imagination carries through to her adult life, and manifests itself in delightful ways (no other character in cinema could melt away into a splash of water at the sight of her true love).Through a discovery of a long-lost box of childhood trinkets and the sad-yet-blissful restoration to its rightful owner, Amelie resolves to bring cheer and zest to the lives of her fellow Parisians.  Not content to whisk a blind man down a crowded street, narrating all the peculiar sights, sounds, and smells of daily Parisian life that he can no longer fully appreciate, Amelie takes it upon herself to be, at times, a match-maker, an instrument of revenge against a local bully (hilarious comeuppance alert!), and a re-writer of heartbreak.One of the most entertaining subplots of the movie has to do with her father, who even though he has the freedom to travel (he is a widower, brought about through the most freakish of accidents) refuses to do so.  Amelie sends his beloved garden gnome on a travel across the world, including pictures sent from abroad to her mystified dad.Of course, a romantic spirit like Amelie's can't avoid falling in love.  But when she falls in love, it can't be a straightforward seduction.  Elaborate courting, hilarious misunderstandings, and a boiling-over romanticism make for a powerful conclusion to a charming film.Note:  the DVD does not have an option for listening to a dubbed English version - if you don't speak French, you're going to have to work with subtitles.  I don't speak a lick of French, but listening to the dialogue in French adds something to its romance, so I think this is an improvement rather than a burden -- if I had the option, I'd still go with the subtitles (this works with other foreign films, too, like &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; where dubbing just doesn't work).  The DVD has some good extras, too -- we're not talking a Peter Jackson treasure trove, but they are worth it.Easily one of my favorite movies, and one that you will want to watch again and again.	5.0	Hopelessly Romantic -- Paris Never Looked Better!	2004-05-26	9	7	2

I love to see things blow up, bad kung-fu, random shots of cleavage, etc. And I would NEVER pick up a French movie on my own. NEVER. Somehow, this movie shows up on my list of Netflix recommendations. They knew that I cry during Disney movies and try to hide it from my wife and kids. This movie made me cry, but I was crying because I was so happy, and this movie is beautiful, just unbelievably beautiful. This movie is about creating joy in the life of others, as well as in your own life. But not the kind of joy that comes from instant gratification. Its the kind of joy that takes days, weeks, and months to develop. In fact, this movie is really about delayed gratification of a kind so profound that it happens as a complete surprize when it finally arrives. The direction is wonderful and quirky. The acting is superb, and the musical score is also unique and fitting. If you've ever wondered about how to make a difference in your life or the life of others without being a CEO or a Senator, this is your movie.

There are some genuinely poignant moments in the film, the most touching being when Amelie finally lets her guard down and allows Mr. Photo-Booth guy into her life. I love the last scene when they are motorcycling down the Parisian streets. The film is also a photographic wonder; everything, from the subway to the streets, is infused with color and light. And finally, there are some funny scenes--the gnome posing alongside famous buildings and monuments and Amelie's dad looking at the photos in disbelief is pretty high on the list.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1ZEC2CUWJD8OM	S. Foster	Although I have studied French @ University to PhD Level & have therefore been influenced by French cinema, I can objectively say that Amelie is a movie that can inspire & mesmerise the most hardened anglophone.  Perhaps one of great cultural changes of recent times has been Hollywood's embrace of more & more foreign language movies (Life Is Beautiful, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ring, Audition to name but a few).  Amelie's appearance is therefore as timely & strategic as it is wonderful.  The film embarks on a magical journey of a young & naive girl who works as a waitress in Montmartre & the quirks of her everyday life & the people with whom she encounters.  Amusing & touching, & perfectly shot, the tight script & gripping colours & cinematography render this oeuvre a captivating watch which shall mesmerise again & again.  Audrey Tatou plays the ingenue with such wit & charm (as the cheeky cover alone suggests) as a woman who influences others more than she wishes her own life to be influenced.  Some of the most captivating scenes are Tatou dashing pebbles across the water (it's ony about 15 seconds long but majestically shot) & the character introductions at the beginning (her parents are wickedly hilarious) & the evil greengrocer & Amelie's revenge on him.  If there's one movie you should consider purchasing it is definitely this.  Perhaps my favourite French movie now (along with Les Visiteurs, Manon Des Sources & Cyrano de Bergerac), it shall get repeated plays on my DVD player.  Great extra features too!	5.0	Au-dela des mots!!!	2002-04-24	22	20	2

I'm not gonna say much about it, just that if you've spent a good deal of your life looking for ""the one,"" you'll understand what this movie is trying to say about this seemingly endless quest. However, despite the wonderfulness of this movie, the ending, while very romantic, is flawed. It depicts two people who have searched long and hard for each other in an effort to be loved having sex, something so carelessly base that a star has to be subtracted. One would think that the two would TALK, thus subscribing to the wills of their higher selves, not procreate in order to please their reptillian instincts. Overall, though, this movie is outstanding. If you want music that captures the same sort of warm, childish spirit, go out and buy Finally We Are No One by M&uacute;m. It's good stuff."	4.0	One point off for the sex	2003-01-27	35	11	24
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2U109NBAFMO88	"""shamgaranath"""	For some reason, even though I'm not a very big fan of movies I have to read, they usually end up being my favorites. This is the kind of movie you want to snuggle up next to the person you love, grab a tub of popcorn and start a roaring fire. This may have the appearance of a chick flick (I guess it is in most respects.), but both genders can enjoy this film greatly. When I saw this in the theatres, the whole audience was roaring. I even laughed out loud several times. This has got to be one of the funniest movies ever made. I laughed (I don't think it made me cry.), hoped and prayed during the whole movie.The most inspiring stories are those where insignificant people are shown to be significant in the lives of others. Amelie is one of those stories of how one insignificant, beautiful (and I do mean beautiful) waitress can inspire and touch the world around her. There is some mild language, sexual content and humor and brief nudity.This is a must-see. Audrey Tautou's eyes alone make this movie worth a fortune.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2CVVCODXDVJO6	Shirley Li	I am far from an expert on French film. But as an AP french student, I have seen the eccentric, the subtle, the whimsical, the heroic, the tender, and the callous side of French cinema in films like My Life in Pink, My Mother's Castle, and The Horseman on the Roof. So there, I went to Amelie with some expectations from those past experiences. But actually, many raving reviews received before the film was even released in the US gave my impatience the needed extra push.The story is about a Parisian girl named Amelie (a wide-eyed elfish/nymph like Audrey Touton) who grows up to become a heroine bigger than the aimless life she seemed destined to lead. Having discovered the joy of charity and creating miracles for all those around her, Amelie is at last ready for some miracles performed for her. And enters Nino, an unlikely Prince Charming, whose boyish chagrin adds an extra charm to the already light-hearted film. The whole cast is amazing as one eccentric character after another is introduced and subtly pricks the audience's bourgeoisie/mainstream taste and conscience. The pace is delightful as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet moves his camera through the streets of a dream-like Paris. Everything seems perfect in Jeunet's world as the colors of clothing and the mood, the atmosphere, the music coalesce to contrast the emotional edges that chafe inside all of us. Amelie is determined to change everyone's live by scraping off those edges, and by the end of the film, I myself was ready to doubt the feasibility of unhappiness.So how is Amelie the film French? Like a sophiscated, artsy informercial, Amelie possesses a light, springy, optimistic tone that easily seduces the audience into believing there is beauty in the world and poetry in even the most banal occurrences. But Amelie the film is also universal, especially now. Because without the heavy grandiosity (so prevalent in escapist films of the war and patriotic genre), Amelie speaks to the heart, and unleashes another form of heroism ~ the most unobtrusive kind.	5.0	Elle va changer ta vie!	2001-12-09	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3LR8SZY00IW9Z	"Shooshie ""Shooshie"""	Amelie is the most wonderful breath of loveliness to cross the big screen in many years. I chuckle at some of the reviewers who try to treat it as flawed art in some misunderstood tradition. . Let's get back to the basics of life, which is where art comes from. The director of this film followed his spirit, not Hollywood, thank God. This is a French movie, not an American movie; I restate the obvious because I have not seen anything emerge from Hollywood in a decade or more that is this uplifting, this entertaining, this funny, this poignant, this beautiful, and which leaves one feeling so wrapped in love. I don't know whether we Americans have lost the touch, or if we never had it. Oh... wait... Moulin Rouge comes close. I stand corrected. But Amelie reminds me of a long list of movies in the French tradition which leave me smiling and reassured that the world is not spinning off its axis and careening into the fearful abyss. Love and sweetness find their ways through any obstacles, however primitive or modern, and Amelie somehow connects the old and the new with that joi d'vivre wherein the most pathetic of human existences are all revealed to be golden at the core--all respond to the spirit of Love.Amelie is entertainment that massages your spirit. Yes, I know I've used that word already; it's intentional--this movie works on the level of the human spirit! The vistas of Paris, from downtown to Montmartre, to the suburbs, will bring you wonderful memories, and if you haven't been to Paris, the movie will GIVE you memories. The trains, the stations, the streets, the cityscapes, the people... oh, and the music. Then let's not forget the charming Audrey Tautou, who delivers a character so sweet it aches in the solar plexus where you crave to know her. If you're dead to the world, you might not like Amelie, but if there is some spark in you that you remember once having but can't seem to find; I promise Amelie will find it and blow on it and set it ablaze again. If you, like me, find yourself looking at the current waves of movies to wash up on the surf from Hollywood, shaking your head and walking away empty handed and wondering if they've simply made all the good movies already and nothing worthwhile is left, this is the movie to spice up that malaise and set your mouth watering again.I will spare  you another plot synopsis; one really cannot do it justice here anyway, but hear me--from my spirit to yours (oh my, there's that WORD again!) --I can't recommend this movie enough. As the original review stated, this is one of the most charming movies of all time. A classic. If you ever do one thing that ol' Shooshie recommends, do this one.Shooshie	5.0	Amelie	2002-09-15	9	9	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	This superb film is about the oddball girl of the title, and how she comes to find love through the strange characters that surround her in her life.The opening section of the film is very funny as we are told of each characters personal likes and dislikes. These are not earth shattering things, but the trivial things that we all (OK most of us) take for granted like cleaning out the toolbox. The film uses a narrator to tell us these things, and this technique works well, mainly because the film is wonderfully well-written. Because of this what seems completely illogical at some points all falls beautifully into place.Amelie it turns out although a shy and withdrawn girl on the surface, has a sharp and scheming mind which leads to some marvellous scenes, all of which I might add are directed with a huge amount of style and panache. For a film just over two hours long it maintained my interest virtually continuosly and its certainly one that I will be watching again.Its a film like this that makes you realise what a lot of rubbish is coming out of Hollywood these days. I say that as a person who is not a fan of foreign language films. However this is something very special and I can't do justice to it in a short review.

B0000640VO	Amelie	ADEW9NW1HGTNJ	"""songbear"""	"Amelie is a rare delight.  The title character is a painfully shy loner who discovers a small box filled with a little boy's keepsakes.  She seeks the rightful owner of the box.  The charm of this film is that Amelie wants to perform her little miracles, hiding in the shadows, with no recognition for herself.  The characters in this piece are fascinating, each one reflecting back a facet of Amelie's personality.  In the end, Amelie's compassion ends up being her own salvation - and that is what makes the film so much of a joy to watch.  Hollywood has pretty much exchanged emotion and subtlety for rudeness, crudeness, and over processed digital special effects.  Like a good French wine, this motion picture is an experience to be savored - not devoured.  Amelie has a look and feel that stands out from anything I've seen in recent years.  So many modern films are filtered with a grayish or orange tint, which tricks the viewer's eye into thinking it is watching a stark, gritty documentary.  Steven Soderbergh seems to be the reigning master of this technique.  Amelie by contrast, with it's deep reds and fluorescent and forest greens accented by cobalt blues and electric yellows, transports you to a world full of magic and hope.  The effect is enchanting.The DVD package is complete with commentaries and documentaries on the making of the film.  These added features make it clear that this film was carefully planned by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, much like ""The Sixth Sense.""  Shots were storyboarded, set up, and orchestrated months in advance.  And any extra footage of Audrey Tautou is always welcome in my home.  A blend of the beauty and grace of Audrey Hepburn, the humor and physical skill of Charlie Chaplin, and the vulnerability of early Winona Ryder, and the sultry elegance of a sixties European model.  Her method of using her eyes, facial expression, and body language (relying less on verbal expression) to create a character is what helps makes Amelie transcend language barriers.I was a little disappointed there wasn't a version with dubbed English, but after 15 minutes or so, I didn't even notice that I was reading subtitles.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A5C83HTL64KOZ	"""sophiasings"""	Shining in a role that more than slightly resembles Audrey Hepburn, Audrey Tatou is sweet, flighty and more than a little devious.  Amelie is a lonely waitress at a local bar/tabac in the Montmartre section of Paris.  After the death of Princess Diana of Wales, she discovers a box of 'treasures' that once belonged to the little boy who lived in her apartment years before.  Embarking on a 'quest', she reunites the now grown man with his childhood and is prompted to 'right other wrongs', eventually learning the difference between living and existing.	3.0	Vive Amelie!	2002-01-23	9	1	8

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2QKCOX5ACRHC5	Sreeram Ramakrishnan	The story centers around a shy and &quot;playful&quot; character (Audrey Tautou) who becomes a secret guardian angel for other lonely people. The irony of the situation is that she herself has had a lonely childhood and her adulthood isn't any better.  Nevertheless, she decides to &quot;help&quot; others unseen.  The various episodes to illustrate the transition is well-presented.  There is a certain charm in the narrative style used by the director - in portraying fairly mundane activities with a novel vigor and mysterious charm. Having a wonderful cast does help that cause. In between helping others, the character realizes her own loneliness.  The story then moves into a &quot;chance romantic&quot; realm.The movie is well taken, and is blessed with excellent score and talented cast.  Some slick editing adds to the wonderful spirit of the movie. (Since I dont speak French, the subtitles were critical, though the screenplay and the actors by themselves seem to have conveyed the intent and flow of the story pretty well!).  Wonderful features in the bonus DVD.  It is a must-see.  Overall, sweet and wonderful movie...slow at times with the plot...but never boring.

Do the French just feel more passionately about life in general? Maybe so, maybe not. But I think this film could melt the frostiest stiff.Everyone Amelie encounters has such an interesting personality and she brings such a ray of sunshine into their lives. From encouraging her father, by hilarious means, to travel the world, mischievously matchmaking cafe locals and of course her absolutely romantic stratagems she devises to pursue true love, this film breathes humanity. ""Do you want to meet me?""... who wouldn't be curious about that!?The part where she's day dreaming of Nino sneaking up behind her , running his hand across the beaded curtain, which simultaneously turns out to be her cat, is such a beautiful human touch that I rarely see done in films. Heart warming and genius.The adorable Audrey Tautou is magical to watch as she brings Amelie to life with caring and compassion. She drinks life so deeply.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AZQ6PYDEJQJEF	"Staring Girl ""Staring Girl"""	I for one really enjoyed this movie; perhaps because I could really relate to the main character. Amelie is essentially the story of a very shy, introverted young woman. People need to keep this in mind when viewing this movie. She is faced with difficult people and problems in her life, and instead of blowing up at these people and problems verbally; she is more cunning and cleaver and helps out using less obvious, more creative means. Yes, she doesn't speak very much throughout the movie, but maybe we need more people like her in the world. People who shut the heck up and figure out problems in more imaginative, peaceful ways. She saw flaws in people's lives and instead of confronting these people, she helped guide them in seeing there errs in more inconspicuous ways, yet she was reluctant to face her own problems in her own life. The ultimate conclusion of the move is that she was finally able to see there were flaws in her own life from lack of confronting her feelings of love. I feel Amelie is a wonderful work of art. This is not one of those Hollywood films that just screams out its message. The film is full of subtleties.	5.0	Full of subtleties.	2005-05-24	4	3	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3UNGGV9D2UVQY	Stephane Lauzon	I saw all the 5 nominees for best picture for the academy awards (including A beautiful mind) and also the picture who won best foreign (no man's land) and this one has my vote for the best picture, american and foreign, of 2001. First of all it has a great look, not your typical color movie but more like a beautiful painting. You have a lot of green and red colors which makes it look different and particular but it works and the film look more artistic. One thing that makes a film work usually is the relation you develop with the main character(s), let me tell you I was in love with Am&eacute;lie (Audrey Tautou) 5 minutes after I've seen her for the first time. She reminded me of the other Audrey (Hepburn) who you fell in love with everytime you see her on the screen. This Audrey Tautou has the charm and the beauty that I can't find anywhere today (Julia Roberts...don't make me laugh). Her character has such a beautiful soul and so many sweet qualities that you love and root for her even more as the story goes along. The other characters surrounding her during this wonderful story are all very colorful and all different in their own way which makes for a richer movie. Since I am a big fan of silent movie, I like the way the story is told, the screenplay is great but a lot is told by images. This is a visual film and I'm not talking about explosions and major hollywood special effects, the emotions of Am&eacute;lie are often seen visually and this way of telling a story is not seen or not enough seen today. The great HBO series six feet under does that. The storyline is simple, Am&eacute;lie tries to make everyone happy around her and not thinking about her own happiness, the magic is the way the story is told and the high caliber performance of Audrey Tautou. The director tell, in one of the interview that you can see on the disc 2 of this double disc DVD, that he wanted Emily Watson (the english actress) for the role of Am&eacute;lie but she declined. She's a great actress but good for us cause Audrey Tautou is more than perfect. I've been waiting a few months for the US version of the movie (because here in Quebec we had a french release since june) and the wait is worthwhile. This is the ultimate version, you can see the french version with or without subtitles, 2 audio commentaries one in french (for me) and one in english and the second disc is full of interesting special features. Many interviews, screen tests, photos of the production, home movies and more. Thanks USA for this ultimate version which is much better than the single disc produced here.	5.0	Best picture of 2001	2002-07-18	8	7	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"""Amelie"" is one of the more difficult movies to do a writeup for, simply because it's so completely off on its own: to my knowledge, there's never been another movie like this, before or since.  It's got a vibe all of it's own that makes it an inspiring and comedic standout.Amelie Poulain - played to perfection by Audrey Tatou in one of the world's alltime great performances - is a shy, somewhat elflike, highly idealistic girl with a strong sense of justice, an extremely acive imagination, and a thinly buried flair for mischief a mile wide.  After finding an old box of childhood treasures hidden behind some boards in her apartment, she takes it upon herself to track down the original owner of these toys and odds-&-ends.  When the original owner turns out to be a now-quite-melancholy older man who is deeply cheered by the return of these old memories, and touched by someone's having taken the time and effort to return them, Amelie too is uplifted, and thereafter takes it upon herself to help those whose lives she feels could use a boost.  In spite of her impish altruism, though, Amelie is unable to pursue her own dreams of her own accord, and the question of the movie is whether life will work out for Amelie even as she's secretly helping others to achieve their own dreams.  Of historical note, the movie features the best performance ever by a ceramic garden gnome(!) whom Amelie abducts from its owner's garden and sends on various trips around the world to get its picture taken and sent to the owner before its eventual triumphant return home, in hopes of inspiring that person to follow up on their own dream of world travel!  The angle is played so beautifully that the gnome actually becomes his own character, and it inspired the growing global trend of benevolent 'gnome-napping' that you may heard about, and has made its way into numerous travel commercials.  That there is just one of the many inventive schemes Amelie hatches to try and 'push' people towards happiness.Truly, a one-of-a-kind movie, totally delightful."	5.0	A Fantastic, Uplifting Enchantment Of A Movie	2006-05-09	3	2	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A37F8W82A1E6L7	Stephen Cords	It is amazing what one person can accomplish when they really put their mind to it. I'm not talking about huge global changes here. Most of us will never be in a position where we can significantly impact a huge number of people in a positive way. This film shows that you really don't have to. Anyone who simply decides to make the lives around them better can succeed a lot more than they fail. Background, education and station have nothing to do with making that little decision and taking action on it.Amelie is a simple girl, with simple tastes. Some one who would just as soon spend an evening skipping stones as going to a fancy restaurant with a man. She is not looking for love so much as direction. Up to the point where the story really begins, Amelie has been simply drifting, as most of us do. Victim of the events that her life has thrown at her. She has a job, an apartment and friends... Maybe not friends so much as aquaintences. The people she lives around and those she works with become her project. Amelie becomes a doer of good deeds.The story plays out sweetly and with very inventive visuals. I'm sure we've all seen the trailers with the pig-lamp that turns itself off and the scene where Amelie disintegrates into a puddle of water after talking with a man she fancies. These effects are not distracting and really do lend themselves well to the progression of the story. Comparissons to Alley MacBeal are inevitable, but mostly inaccurate. Where the illusions on Alley's show were often violent or overtly sexual, those in Amelie are sweet and fanciful. The illustrate the nature of the young woman who has made it her goal in life to make those around her a little happier.The disk itself is loaded with supplements that will allow the viewer to enjoy the film on another level. This is a must have for anyone's collection. Buy it and watch it with some one you love.	5.0	Simply Put, A Beautiful Film	2002-07-19	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	Amelie (2001)Comedy, Fantasy, Romance122 minutes, French LanguageDirected by Jean-Pierre JeunetStarring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu KassovitzSeveral of my favorite directors produce movies which have a distinct feel, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of them. He can take the darkest topics and infuse them with his own brand of humor. Amelie is not one of his darker films, but it feels like part of his familiar world.The star of Amelie is Audrey Tautou and she shines in the role. The movie isn't serious at all and is filled with amusing stories and delivered in a whimsical way. We are introduced to the characters by a narrator who tells us their likes and dislikes. I love the use of narration when it's done well.Amelie is a young woman who accidentally discovers a box of childhood treasures left hidden in her apartment by a previous tenant. She decides to track him down to return it and resolves to do similar good deeds if the outcome is favorable. She's not completely good though. One person in particular annoys her so she decides to play a few pranks to teach him a lesson.The movie has plenty of mystery and eventually turns into an unconventional romance. The color scheme places an emphasis on red and green and the world seems surreal. The setting is Paris, but this isn't the Paris that I know from my visits.Audrey Tautou is an incredible actress. She can convey a lot of emotion without saying a word. Her face is one of the most expressive that I have seen. If you have only seen her in The Da Vinci Code, Amelie is a great chance to see her act in her native language.I know people who would avoid seeing Amelie because it's in French and it's a romance. That would be a mistake. The movie is a pure delight and has a unique style. It won't appeal to everyone, but those who like it will really love it.	5.0	Jeunet's sense of humor is so refreshing	2012-02-29	2	2	0

The guy she starts searching for is just a nerd.The first two thirds of this film are as good as any film can ever get.Audrey Tautou is great in the role of Am&eacute;lie and it is, no doubt, a role which she will be remembered for, for many years to come.	4.0	Really very good, but ....	2006-10-01	7	2	5

It was delightful, and I love how it was made, it was new and fresh. I liked the close ups and the music and I liked that brief segment where Amelie, on a thrill of harmony and goodwill after hearing Dominique Bredoteau's reaction to the finding of his childhood box in a bar, directs a blind man down a block and gives him eyes for a moment, in describing the delicious world to him.This is not the first foreign film I have seen. I have also seen Antonia's Line, and Burnt by the Sun, and I love all of these movies. Amelie is a very, very good movie.

Even so, this is one of my favorite films (which is testament to how good this film really is...or maybe it's just time for me to re-evaluate my judgment on French culture).  It's refreshing to watch a high quality film that's obviously not a product of a Hollywood studio.  I had to watch Amelie several times to catch all the director's visual subtleties which I missed while reading subtitles.  At its core Amelie is a love story.  But its theme is more complex.  Like the Beatles white album line: ""In the end the love you take is equal to the love you make"", Amelie sprinkles her special kind of love all over Paris and unwittingly embarks on her own emotional rollercoaster.  I hope see more French films of this quality."	5.0	And I don't even like French Stuff	2007-01-07	2	1	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A14OB7YKMPBJLW	Susan Fong	&quot;Amelie&quot; is a wondrous and whimsical movie about a shy, beautiful young woman named Amelie who emerges from her sheltered, dream-like existence into the real world.One fateful night, Amelie discovers a little keepsake box in her apartment.  This inspires her to find the owner of the box. She does find the owner.  She is so overjoyed by the owner's gratitude that she ventures out to do more good deeds for more people.  In the process, she changes peoples' lives for the better.  She also learns to trust people.  Amelie becomes a participant in life instead of only an observer as she had been.  And she eventually overcomes her fear of relationships and finds a soulmate.Visually, &quot;Amelie&quot; is a marvel in filmmaking with stunning cinematography and surprising, even startling special effects that are seemlessly blended into the comedy, romance, and fantasy of the story. The quirky narration and dialogue are filled with witty and worldy observations about life in Paris and about life in general.&quot;Amelie&quot; is imaginatively brought to life by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and by its radiant star, Audrey Tautou.  Hers is a starmaking performance.  Tautou endearingly and precisely captures the hesitant charm, fragility, ingenuity, and ultimate determination of our heroine Amelie with exceptional subtlety and grace that should have earned her at least an Academy award nomination. The movie itself deserved to win Best Foreign Picture but didn't.  Go figure.By all means, buy this DVD.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1HS9F7J51E9CB	sweetmolly	Gamine Audrey Tautou is beautifully cast as the shy young waitress who can make everyone happy but herself.  You see a gorgeous, primary colored, clean Paris through her eyes, and it is a sight to behold!  Amelie, though a very empathetic character, is not saccharine.  People who offend her are tricked.  She is devious in her methods of bringing joy and settling scores.I particularly liked the Frenchness (for lack of a better word) of the film.  The French have a pragmatic, relaxed view of sex that is so at odds with the serious and rather frantic importance we Americans give to the subject.  Now food, on the other hand, is a very serious business and not casual at all to the French.  I noticed all kitchens, no matter how small, were fully equipped with every type of blender, beater and bowl (but not necessarily appliances.)  When Amelie eats a solitary dinner, she sets the table, has a glass of wine and three carefully prepared courses.When Amelie falls in love, her shyness about does her in.  She is fearless at helping others, but almost paralyzed at helping herself.  You really pull for her even while getting a little exasperated with her hide and seek methods.  There is enough comedy throughout to keep the film from being oversweet.The DVD:  The color is excellent, the sound good and the images sharp and clear.  The package is good and interesting.  There are subtitles in English and Spanish, no dubbing.  People who are slow readers may have problems with following the action and the subtitles, as it is the type of film that demands your visual attention.	4.0	A Charmer	2002-10-09	6	4	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A27R1R0R0MSB36	swinglad	It is a rare thing to watch something as beautiful as Amelie and even better because it happens to be in French. Which makes it an even stronger endeavor. I loved it from the very first scene, and by the end I was crying tears of joy. It is beauty in it's simplest form. True beauty! Not the commercialized, hollywood defenition; it is the real thing and the sad part about that is most people will fail to see it or understand. If we could all only see the world through the eyes of Amelie or those of Nino. What a world that would be; it would be pure. I loved it and believe it to be one of the greatest films ever made. The strength is in the story line and the way that the actors and actresses bring each character alive. I watched this film three nights in a row; I am lucky in that I work for a video store and I was able to view it through a demo tape. I would encourage everyone to see this film. I believe that if everyone watches this film with an open heart and mind that it will touch their lives. Then they in turn will touch others around them. Beauty is in the simplest of things; if only we could remember that every day. Ameile will touch the soul and you will be begging for more. This is a masterpiece of the age. A classic among so many films that tend to be boring and void.  This film is what making and watching films are all about. It is a Monet of the year 2001.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3OMPSEVL59ZDK	"Sylo ""Sylo"""	A woman with the mind of a child. A film that is colorful and imaginative bogs itself down with a contrived romance that trips and falls into your typical hollywood shlock. The twist is that the only thing keeping these two lovers apart is Amelie herself. She is both protagonist and antagonist and this will frustrate you, dear viewer, to no end. If this film wasn't in French I wonder how many people will be hailing it as they do now. It has some cute inspired moments (such as the traveling Gnome) and her mission to help others started out intriguing enough but the film falls into false sentimentality and quickly we learn that Amelie isn't a character, she's a puppet with the mannerism of a barbie doll and the maturity of a 12 yr old girl. Where are the strong confident female characters? Is this the best the french have to offer? Is this just an American movie indisguise? Don't be fooled by the subtitles, just because it's in a foreign language doesn't make it any better than your typical hollywood romantic comedy. Amelie starts off promising but fails because instead of getting a strong female character we get a walking doll who gets in her own way just to stretch this film to it's two hour time mark.	2.0	Amelie helps everyone but herself	2005-03-14	41	12	29

B0000640VO	Amelie	AFK7G4IEWMY05	Taras Tkachenko	"Even if, having read the previous reviews, you are expecting something smarter and funnier than your average inane RC, you still shouldn't focus on either the romance or the comedy. Because, to my mind at least, they are not the most important sides of the story. Rather, the love-and-happiness quality of the film stems from a certain very serious philosophical attitude, exemplified most obviously by the Tour De France scenes, when past and present come together.To repeat,  Amelie he Movie does not try to be ""heartwarming."" It only HAPPENS to have that effect on those without an understanding of Amelie the Character's unique vision. (By the way, the ""heart"" root figures too often in the preceding reviews, as though the film's theme and goal is to show us How We Can All Be Nice To Each Other and flood the audience with sweet joy. It's NOT.)Again, don't make the mistake of taking this for a just-about ""family"" movie. It's not light-weighed, it's trim like an athelete's perfected body. Instead, watch it carefully. The hints are all here. Notice the depth of difference between Amelie and her mostly likeable but ordinary acquaintances. Take note how she stands out against this background, invisibly playing with it, usually kindly, sometimes vengefully, all the while keeping a low profile.Of course, to the casual viewer Amelie seems a wonderful, quirky, shy person basically not very different from everyone else. Ho. Right, wouldn't YOU like to believe yourself to be as free-spirited and deeply empathic, wouldn't YOU like to think that you, too, possess the same kind of instant intuitive insight, that you feel and understand life with the same acuteness? More important (this isn't about insulting you personally, dear reader, but about prying your eyes open) wouldn't you like to think that ALL people are like Amelie on some level, and that if only we could pay more attention to each other, life would change dramatically?Well, forget all that. As we all MUST admit in moments of honesty, the great majority of people, and France is no exception, are not nice, or sweet, or imaginative. The average person anywhere is usually quite dull, stressed-out and self-concerned - whatever better directions his life might have taken in different circumstances. It's been mentioned that Paris of ""Amelie"" is not the real city with its problems. Well, of course it's not, and people in the movie are not ""real"" either - to anyone except Amelie and her friend/lover/comrade. They are creatures of a sharply different kind. In fact, the tinge of golden and pink that gives the cinematography here its special charm is an attempt to introduce the viewer to this special vision!This is to say, we see the whole movie as though THROUGH THE EYES of Amelie. If it weren't so, the people around her would seem perfectly ordinary to you, dear reader. She, for her part, does not care for a whole cluster of concepts mundanes have, e.g. ""reality,"" ""living within one's imaginings"" etc. Which is why the film is unafraid to use special effects even in its Monmartre scenes. It's no surprise, then, that the ""realistic"" ending with leaping into the sack seems not just disappointing, but also somehow unlikely. Having watched the movie, anyone begins to suspect that Amelie's life would be doomed to a (at least inwardly) dramatic and adventurous course.In short, she is incredibly gifted to only partially belong to this dreary world, and equally gifted, not to mention lucky, to meet someone else of her kind. Of course, a psychiatrist deprived of their vision would think them both slightly deluded, and nearly EVERY person to have written a review on this site, too, is comfortably convinced of the same, even if it doesn't feel important. ""Fantasy,"" ""sweet,"" ""fairy-tale"" - those are keywords betraying just how remote most of the commentators are from understanding this movie (even if some of them words zero in on the truth in an uncanny way). The reason is, to understand something so personally-colored, it is necessary to either have had similar experiences or at least seriously CONSIDER the movie's message. ""Amelie"" is a rare example of ""Air from other planets,"" of true art in popular entertainment, but if you refuse to put away your customary ides about what is real and so forth, all you will see on this DVD is a pretty, funny romantic flick.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2EBKTWA8T3WFR	T. Audibert	"From director Jean-Pierre Jeunet comes the charming romantic comedy ""Amelie"", a film that greatly transcends it's genre. Romantic Comedies are a dime a dozen here in the States, but Jeunet has crafted a very quirky, fun and visually pleasing film that delivers comedy and romance both in spades without ever feeling cheesy or familiar.Ameile Poulain is a shy and reserved 23 year old girl who had a rather odd childhood. Her mother was killed when a suicide jumper landed on her and father, though a good provider and kind person, never showed Amelie much affection, erroneously diagnosing her with a heart condition and having her homeshooled. Truth be told, Amelie's heart would race when her father would medically examine her, leading him to believe she had a heart condition. In reality, affection was what cause her excitement.Fast forward to 1997. Amelie has a flat all to herself, and desires a relationship but due to bad luck in the past has all but given up on them. She works in a small cafe in town with a group of eccentric co-workers, but she goes home alone to her cat each night. Amelie is lonely, but too shy to go out and meet people. She feels it's time for a change in her life, but she feels things will happen on their own.One morning, Amelie hears of the death of Princess Diana on television and, in shock, she drops in the cap of a perfume bottle. The cap rolls toward a tile on the lower wall and knocks it down, revealing a space inside, where a rusty box of momentos lies. She feels the need to return it to it's owner, now a middle aged man, and when he recieves it he feels so much joy that Amelie, satisfied by her good deed, goes on a mission. Do good deeds for others to bring a little happiness to their lives. However, karma does come her way when she finds an interesting scrapbook that a man leaves behind at a photo booth. Through this book, she develops an infatuation with this man. Is he the one she needs to fill the empty romantic void in her own life?Amelie has a stylish and colorful fairytale romp, well-crafted and smart without coming across as pretentious. The colors and settings are bright and vivid, and make you long to be in the city of Paris. The film goes inside Amelie's always-daydreaming mind. The viewer enters a world where televisions, and other inanimate objects, talk to you. The pixie-like nature of Amelie, played by the beautiful Audrey Tatou, is a perfect fit for this eccentric character. The cinematography is breathtaking, bringing to mind the vivid colors and atmosphere of 'Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas"", but with less acid of course. It all feels like a dream, a setting so perfect and surreal it dosen't feel realistic, but that's what cinema is about. ""Amelie"" is a 2 hour escape into a the title characters world with everything is serene and perfect, and it's a mighty enjoyable ride.There's a timeless feel to ""Amelie"", it's a feel-good film that makes the viewer feel hopeful. The musical score by Yann Tierson fits the images like a glove and is very memorable and unique. This is one of those rare films where everything just falls into place. I highly recommend it to any fan of cinema, regardless of taste. When you invite Amelie into your world, she won't be forgotten. Like she did for the characters in the film, she might just change your life. After all, theres a little Amelie Poulain in all of us."	5.0	A woman without love wilts like a flower without sun.	2009-08-17	3	3	0

But after the first few minutes of the film, I was already in love; this film is so vastly different from other movies from the same category -it's smart and witty.What makes it different is the point of view from the main character, Amelie. Being that she is a timid girl with an enormous imagination, the story tastefully draws off her charming creativity and how she uses it to meddle in the lives of those around her. And as any charming movie does, what goes around comes around.The acting is superb, the story is clever, and the filmwork is masterful. Even an illiterate person would have fun watching this film.

Some felt the female lead, Audrey Tautou, wasn't a strong character and she goes through life only to be interested in a non-leading type of a guy.  I think they missed the point because the female leads goes through a growing process and it is an adventure.I have since watched many Audrey Tautou pictures and I found her acting wonderful and she carries a good acting range of ability in portraying different characters, and that this movie was just one role in which she was certainly very entertaining.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AT7W1EXT0PF2Y	The Patriarch	Never-the-less this is a fun romantic comedy and if you watch it with a woman she may sleep with you.Amelie, like all women, is bat-shxxt crazy. She is raised by her father because her mother died in a horrible sky-diving accident. Her father is completely out of his gourd and spends his time playing with garden gnomes.Amelie spends most of her time by herself daydreaming. This changes, a little, when she has an epiphany and decides to devote her life to helping others. This usually involves her going completely out of her way to but her head into other people's lives to help them whether they want to or not. Not unlike a boyscout that drags an old lady across the street when she never asked him to and wasn't headed in that direction anyway. Speaking of that, in one scene she drags an old blind man through the streets shouting in his ear! Yes, Amelie is the liberal poster-girl, as long as she thinks she's helping others and feels good about it than she is a good person.Along her travels as an uber-goodnick she falls in love with a man that digs torn up pictures form underneath photo-booths and works in a s e x shop for a living. The rest of the movie involves her passive-aggressive tactics of flirting with him. Instead of dropping her handkerchief around him, she sends him on a wild goose chase and puts confusing posters of herself up around the city, only to chicken out when he finally goes to meet her.Regardless of its confusing message, Amelie is a cute romantic movie that in a world of hack written pulp, adds an artistic flair to the genre. The accordion music soundtrack is great and fits the movie well. There's also a strange greenish tint throughout the movie which is a cool touch.	5.0	Amelie is no good lousy do-gooder!	2007-10-09	4	2	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1RZFX5PRKEXVE	Thomas M. Seay	After having read the blistering attacks on this movie in the French daily &quot;Liberation&quot;,  I expected to either really like this movie or really hate it.  As it turns out, I just found it to be rather mediocre.Bored, mostly working class, lives follow their course without hope of positive resolution.  The protagonist, Amelie, decides to add some magic to these lives by arranging a series of coincidences.  In other words, Amelie is sort of like God in a Kieslowski movie.  The only problem is that you get a buzz like the one you get from a McDonald's Happy Meal...empty calories, high on sugar.  Amelie has that glossy look just like the pretty people in those fragranced women's magazines.So I can see why the French Left would have such a low opinion of this movie.  In a time of deindustrialization and rise of the Right, when most people hope to escape their &quot;fate&quot; by winning the lottery, arrives a film like Amelie which bolsters our hope that there are fairy-godmothers who will swoop down at the last moment and rescue us.Well, you say, that is reading too much into it.  Perhaps. But even as pure fantasy, I found that it fell flat. There are some funny scenes, like the Gnome in New York!  It's a film that appeals to the French love of nuance and making mysteries unravelslowly and enticingly....des trucs interessants.  For these reasons, I have given it two stars.-Thomas	2.0	Truc Interessant...Mais Pas Trop	2002-08-18	23	7	16

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"""Amelie"", a French film from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Delicatessen"", ""City of Lost Children"") is a fairy tale confection that is sure to please most everyone who has the opportunity to watch it.Amelie (Audrey Tautou), a young waitress living in Montmarte, happens to find a small box of toys behind a loose tile in her bathroom. She decides to anonymously reunite the toys with their owner, now a man in his late 40s. After she tracks him down, she leaves the box in a phone booth that he passes every day. As he passes, she calls the booth causing him to stop and find the box. Amelie stops at a local bar and the man also stops there, talking about the curious events of the day. He proclaims that he will call his daughter and grandson, because he hasn't talked to his daughter in many years. Gratified, Amelie begins to do small anonymous favors for the people in her life. Her path crosses with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a strange young man who collects discarded photo booth pictures. She is attracted to him, but completely unable to introduce herself.I think it would be difficult for anyone to dislike ""Amelie"". The story is so uplifting, the lead actress is so enormously appealing and likable, the supporting cast is so excellent, the production qualities are completely top notch.Jeunet has crafted a vision of Montmarte and Paris that is idyllic, picture book perfect, causing many intellectuals in France to denounce the film. In my opinion, these people are trying to find fault with the film because it is so good. They are jealous. This is a lovable confection for all ages. I'll address the all ages thing later.The film is washed in a sepia tint giving each frame the appearance of an old photograph. Set in 1997, the settings look like they were pulled from the 40s. With the exception of a modern video camera, pretty much the entire film is devoid of modern technology. None of the characters drive cars and only one of them uses a small motor bike to get around. This lack of technology only serves to make the film appear even more like a fairy tale.Amelie and her friends inhabit a Paris that is also extremely clean. No graffiti and little dirt appear in any frame as she travels to and fro. This helps attain and retain the idealized vision of life that in turn helps the viewer live inside this fairy tale.Amelie, as played by Audrey Tautou, is so kind, friendly and infectious that it is difficult not to like her. Tautou could pass as Audrey Hepburn's love child, the resemblance is so striking. She is a young woman that realizes she has a gift for helping people anonymously. With this realization, it becomes her reason for life. Amelie is a strange girl, quiet but pretty, unconfident with strangers but also looking for a relationship. She grew up in a strange family environment, which helps explain some of her behavior. This family history is amusingly, and quickly, presented by Jeunet at the beginning of the film. Audrey Tautou is very charming in this role and this film. I inadvertently watched a DVD of ""French Beauty Institute"" the same night. Tautou has a supporting role in the film, but barely makes an impact. Hopefully, she will be able to find the type of roles that will ensure a long and healthy career.The overall message of ""Amelie"" is so uplifting that it raised my spirits all day. Much like the disastrous American film ""Pay It Forward"", the film has a message that if we help strangers, our world will be a better place. The difference in the story between the two films is that ""Amelie"" does not rely on preachy storytelling or character martyrdom to get the message across. Amelie does her thing and the consequences happen, causing us to laugh and learn from her example.Another wonderful thing about the film is that not all of the consequences of her good deeds last for very long. Despite the fairy tale aspect of the film, this helps it seem more real and gives the message more resonance.I would think that ""Amelie"" would be a perfect film to take the entire family to, but there are a few things to be aware of. The film is subtitled, which will prevent the youngest kids from understanding it. Also, there are a few very brief images of nudity in a sexual situation. Two scenes are set in a sex shop and the characters price sex toys before displaying them, but they don't discuss them at all or put them into the context of what they are supposed to do. These few things will probably keep parents from taking children, but, in my view, that is a mistake. If they can read subtitles, they should see ""Amelie"". The film is great for everyone and should eventually be experienced by everyone. Wouldn't it be better for your child to see a film about a girl who does good deeds than some violent action film at every mutliplex?""Amelie"" apparently caused quite a sensation in France. It is now the top grossing film in that country and has inspired people to do little good deeds for strangers. I have even heard that a tour company is offering a tour of the sights used in the film.Hopefully, ""Amelie"" will catch on here in the U.S. as well."	5.0	Brilliant Romance	2005-04-12	4	2	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3HGDIL4M1KAAD	"Tina Morris ""schultheiss"""	"Amelie is another bizarre cruise of a story, and it will suck you in and not let you go until the very last moment. Like Jeunet's great early effort ""Delicatessen"", this movie is filled with some pretty weird characters, and the story evolves from a mosaic of moments that are little story gems in themselves. The main character of the movie, Amelie, is a waitress in a typical Paris bistro, but her solitary life is far from ordinary, as is her upbringing. Bent on the mission of helping people (in her own twisted way), she sets out on several adventures. The discovery of a small metal box hidden behind one of her bathroom tiles by a child some forty years ago sends her on a chase to find this person and reunite him with the lost treasure. At the same time she chases her own luck and love by engaging the guy of her fancy in a chase across Paris. All of the above does a limited if not poor job in describing what goes on in this  bizarre, yet fun and highly entertaining movie that will involve you completely if you allow it to. The cinematography is wonderful alone. Let Amelie into your life and imagination, you won't regret it."	5.0	another bizarre Jeunet gem	2002-12-06	1	1	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A176IA89VGH46M	Todd Bovair	Amelie is one of those rare films that manages to be funny without being juvenile, sentimental without being sappy, and moving without being pretentious. To call it a 'feel-good' movie would be simplifying to a ridiculous degree, although that is essentially what Amelie is. Extremely whimisical (both in the storyline and the slightly garrish way it is shot), the film manages to capture your interest and hold it throughout (although the film is about 15 minutes too long- the only reason I don't rate it a full 5 stars).I won't reveal any plot points (as discovering what the movie is truly about is one of the great pleasures of watching it), but suffice it to say you will be VERY pleasantly surprised if you you are looking for a lighthearted film with a much deeper message attached.Audrey Tautou is unbelievable cute in this film, and does a fantastic job as the main character Amelie. The supporting cast are all excellent in their roles, and really add to the quirky nature of the story. Amelie is a French film, and is best viewed in French with English subtitles (to capture the nuances of the actor's performances).Amelie a fantastic movie that does NOT follow any tired Hollywood fomulas. It is vastly original, and will leave you with a smile and a happy feeling. No kidding!If you are looking to sample some good foreign cinema (since Hollywood churns out almost exclusively CRAP these days), Amelie would be an excellent starting point.Amelie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!	4.0	A whimsical, EXCELLENT film!

She reconnects a man with his childhood. She sparks passion between two lonely people. She brings closure to a mourning woman through a voice from the past. She subtly and deliciously avenges the abuses a mean-spirited employer heaps on a mentally slow but well-meaning assistant. And she sends her own father around the world through the eyes of a simple garden gnome.Amelie is shy. She's empathetic. She's inventive. And, wherever she goes, she dips her hands in sacks of grain and collects flat stones for skipping.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A3N0E03AQD128O	Tony Thomas	"I would have loved this movie without Amelie. I would love a love story or a drama about the real often middle aged or older people in this movie confronting their lives and their loves and their pain, and finding something to sustain themselves in the real grind of life, not in the actions of an ignorant girl with no respect for other people.This is a very artificial movie. It dresses itself up in supposed quirkiness, it claims to be romantic but it is not about what real love or even friendship is about, real people knowing each other, liking each other, sharing their humanity, real people living in life.Essentially, the character Amelie is a person with no social skills, no real friends, and no experience in life or love, and little desire. Yet, she sets herself up with no experience to disturb the happiness and pattern of other people by lying, trying to fix people up with others who are not really interested in each other, and theft.  She steals precious letters from her father to fabricate lies for her concierge--is it an emotional problem you cant be more faithful to your father than to a stranger.The character Amelie really has not respect or faith in the humanity of other people. She only sees them as good or bad, and from a position of ignorance of life breaks into people's homes and steals things, doctor's people's food and medical supplies to cause them wrong, etc. etc.  All of this without trying to find out why people feel the way she does, even though her own life from conception is treated with understanding and explanation for her supposed pain.Amelie ultimately falls in love with a man whose work she steals for a period of time and does not seriously, promptly or courteously attempt to return to him.  Instead, she ferrets out the secrets of his work, and then forces him to go through all kinds of twists and turns and running and climbing up and down hills that would cause a normal person a heart attack.For what?  She doesn't know him.  Nothing meaningful is revealed in his work but obsession.  What does she love, a person?  Or is it that this movie is supposed to be a love story but the author and directors don't know how to talk about real love and real life, so they artificially produce it give this film a plot, when it really has not much of one.At the close of the movie, he comes to her house, she prevents him from speaking to her--having seen him once or twice without saying anything--and they make love.  Then they are seem going through Paris on her motorbike, her father, despite the purloined letters of his love being stolen, decides to travel the world which never has done before, etc.This movie is nothing but the fantasy of the author and director that isolates love and happiness from real life.  A character is created who in essence has no life--curiously before she does all this she is shown not to be interested in boy friends and romance--and no real aspirations.  We learn, a bit surprised, that she just wants love in the abstract or so we are told after being told that she doesn't. Nothing really convinces her that she should. The film simply relies on the fact that we are inserted in a discourse of realizing that movies with attractive young women are love stories.  The assumption is that completion in life for women is only love with a hunking handsome moveie actor type of man. We note all other men except the lover she choses without hearing or speaking a word to him are middle aged or disfigured or ancient.  Her treatment of other people really ranges from the greatest rudeness and manipulation to crime.  I have always thought love involved accepting the humanity of others and realizing that your own humanity can be share with them.Real people struggling to make a real living, real people with quirks and imperfections, real people who do not look as classically beautiful--but dressed unfashionably and ""quirky"" as the costume designer for the film wishes--who are really beset with making a real living-are belittled, persecuted, or given the drastic surgery by crime or abuse that Amelie seems to carry out.  No one who has known the Paris neighborhood Amelie lives in can figure out how she can live in such an apartment, in such a building, on a waitress's tips.The film seems romantic, but it really exports romance outside of real life. The character seems sympathetic, only because she has no real life; none of the real desires needs, ambitions and wants that real people have.  Her actions as some beneficent match maker and changer of trouble people's life in the real world would be better replaced with an ability to learn about the pain that people who have had more life and reality have.She finds her father's letters of passion for his mother while he was away in the army.  Instead of cutting them up and using them to falsify that a philanderer didn't desert her concierge, she should have revisited her view of her mother and late father whom she has remembered as cold and cruel as once being a woman of passion and a man filled with poetry and fire of love. Shouldn't she want to talk to her father about this, treat him differently, respect him as she has not to this point. Indeed who in the world does Amelie respect?See this movie as a low level fantasy for childish thoughts, rather than the deep arty romantic movie it attempts to be.  Instead, it is someone's fantasy that sees love as alienated for real life.  That is sadness."	2.0	an author and director's artificial fantasy so far from real love in the real world	2005-08-14	48	16	32

And there is no feeling of the self-important &quot;look at me&quot; indulgence that so many DVD's have nowadays.If you want a little treat, like a piece of chocolate or a bunch of flowers, treat yourself to this movie instead.P.S.

What I found was one of the most original films I have ever seen.  Describing the plot is simple: Amelie is a young woman looking for love in Paris and dabbles in fixing the lives of her friends.  But that statement does not do the film justice.  I did not know what was going to happen next, and the film continued to surprise me until the end.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2XLI1QOMTHXRT	Trelloskilos	Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a wonderful child-like view of the world and it's eccentricities. I have seen and loved his previous movies, 'Delicatessen' and 'The City of Lost Children', and always come away with a smile on my face and a twinkle in my eye, like I've shared a playground secret or seen a magician perform a magnificent trick just for my own pleasure. Amelie, like the other two films, faultlessly shows off Jeunet's talent as a director.Amelie is a young woman, who as a child, was brought up in 'unconventional' settings. One evening, she makes a discovery (a child's 'treasure-chest' filled with trinkets, marbles and string) and embarks on a mission to see if human kindness will actually touch a heart. Along the way, she meets several of Paris' most eccentric residents and touches all of them in one way or another with her actions.Amelie provides a hope and optimism that seems to be forgotten in the disposable and nihilistic culture that we perceive - an example of how a small act of genorosity and kindness can change someone's outlook on life, and reaps its rewards.While some of the scenes are almost too sweet, and some of the visions too childlike, Amelie also contains some surprisingly clever and enchanting 'mini-stories' that contribute much to the overall storyline, and overall remind you that no matter how old and matured you get, there is still an innocent quality inside you that can still have fun with a sack of beans or bubble-wrap.	5.0	Jeunet does it again!!	2003-01-09	1	1	0

It's original, funny, cute, witty, and gorgeous.  I don't know how anyone could not like it.The picture was tinted green digitally, so don't think that's a Paris thing.  It is beautiful and colorful throughout with great sets and Paris locations.  It has a great French-sounding instrumental soundtrack.  Interesting camera movement and angles and quick editing add to the effectiveness of the great story.  There is a quirkiness to it in style and characters that is similar to Jean-Pierre Jeunet's other films like Delicatessan and City of Lost Children.  I saw Delicatessan on cable many years ago, so I can't really compare the two.  I recently rented City of Lost Children.  Liked it, but I love Amelie.  France has yet another beautiful actress on their hands.  Hope to see much more of Miss Tautou in the years to come.  She's a good reason to start liking subtitles.Probably my favorite film of the last year and certainly on my all-time favorites list.  I couldn't believe it lost to No Man's Land for the Best Foreign Film Oscar.  Probably because it doesn't make any political statements.  I saw both.  No contest.  My only ""complaint"" is that is seemed a bit long.Buy it.  Rent it.  Whatever.  Just see it because it's a charmer."	5.0	Oui, this is definitely a must-see!	2002-08-20	1	1	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	Amelie is 23. She left home and became a waitress at 2 Moulins in Paris. Her mother died in an unusual death and her father was mourning for his wife for life. She has not thought about what she wants to do until the death of Lady Di, also in Paris. Now she is trying to change the life of others, but the fact is that who would be helping her to change her life? Amelie is a very hilarious movie on dealing with all the minute and seemingly trivial problems of life, but in fact all these affect our choice for our life in many occasions. The director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The city of lost children) managed to put all the troubles of life in a minor and light-hearted manner. How we could push ourselves across the seemingly barrier of life depends on what kind of attitude we have. We may have the guts to do so, but just think that we can?t do it and give up. The filming method is very creative and the way Jeunet portray psychological changes through the use of special effects is very outstanding. You would wonder how the director could capture the essence in just a perfect touch of cinematography. Amelie would certainly float you in the air, and it is a definite choice away from mainly stream heavy loading Hollywood stuff.	5.0	Amazingly hiliarious and enjoyable	2001-12-11	1	0	1

It is that eccentricity that brings about the funny bits and the angles she has chosen to help others, and in some cases, her feelings of hopelessness that most would have chosen to ignore.It is difficult to not smile towards the end.	5.0	Sweet, alluring and eccentric - A cute love story	2013-08-14	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	Certainly this years' best, &quot;Amelie&quot; delivers what you expect from the word &quot;cinema.&quot;  Anyone who thinks life is worth living would agree with me.The greatest achievement &quot;Amelie&quot; displays during its non-stop 2 hours joyful ride through Paris is, ultimately, celebration of life.  What is more important is, it tells also dark side of life.  &quot;Amelie&quot; is sweet, indeed, but it is the film's subtle way of implying that life is not actually all made of sugar; (look how Amelie comes to be detached from her own father).  Not forgetting that fact, the film firmly convinces us that life is sweet.  In that respect, &quot;Amelie&quot; shares its viewpoint with &quot;Life Is Beautiful.&quot;Unlike the latter film, which is also a great masterpiece, &quot;Amelie&quot; reaches something very unique.  The narrative skills are full of amazing items; you can see &quot;a suicidal goldfish,&quot; &quot;a falling tourist,&quot; and &quot;a travelling gnome&quot; that really goes to NYC and Moscow!  Or picture yourself with Amelie how many couples are experiencing orgasm right now ... the film literally &quot;picture&quot; the answer (15) !!Besides these amusing scenes, you will be fascinated with colorful characters (one of them is Dominique Pinon as a very nervous guy with a handy recorder, who previously appeared in Jeunet's third sequel of &quot;Alien&quot; series in a wheelchair).  However, it is cute Audrey Tautau who steals every scene in the film.  It is now an incredible fact, but the director was first thinking of Emily Watson as a leading lady (hence Amelie, got it?) but, though I love Emily Watson, the result turned out probably better with Tautou.Finally, &quot;Amelie&quot; proves what a good cinema can do.  It is funny, it is lovely, but most of all, it celebrates life.  And that makes the film a must for everyone living at this age full of troubles.And, really, finally.  Hollywood, don't you ever try to remake it.	5.0	After All, Life Is Beautiful, Amelie Says	2001-12-27	4	3	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2ZRC8P3MBIQL3	"TUCO H. ""H. TUCO"""	"Frank Zappa had it just about right with that quote, and if you're not laughing you've obviously never been to the REAL France (and stepped in some of the ever-present dog-doo on the sidewalks over there or dealt with some of the bizarrely rude attitudes some of the people there happen to be legendary for), or had blinders on when you did go there, inspired by the FANTASY Paris of charming little virtuoso films like ""Amelie."" As for the other side of the coin, if you want France described through rose-colored glasses but from a street poet who knew what he was talking about read Henry Miller's fantastic nauseated-by-Americans classic ""The Air-Conditioned Nightmare.""But away from Zappa & Miller, and back to fantasy land in ""Amelie."" Now, in all fairness to the film, it does contain some very intense and hilarious satire in its first half & is obviously the work of a CINEMATIC virtuoso (which does not imply Jeunet is an ARTISTIC virtuoso also, it only means the guy is a complete master of the TECHNICAL possibilities of the medium), but the splitting of the film between satire & irreverence on the one hand & the most cliched of sappy, schmaltzified romances on the other, seriously hurts the film's effectiveness as a possibly DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT piece of ART-ifact. It starts off majestically & ends up as CHARMING-SATIRE-MINUS-A-LOT-OF-FLUFF, unlike ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"" by the Coen Brothers, which starts off majestically dark & ends an awe-inspiring confirmation of the maxim behind every great 'realist' film: Pascal's famous ""Man's greatness is so obvious it can even be deduced from his wretchedness."" Now, I mention the Coens' film because it is the only film I've seen this year with CINEMATOGRAPHY (courtesy of Mr. Roger Deakins) matching or maybe even surpassing the INSANELY MAGNIFICENT level of the one in display in shot after shot in ""Amelie"" by BRUNO DELBONNEL. I was truly knocked out of my seat by the unerring beauty of the angles used & the antique-look-contrasting-with-modern colors within the shots. I also mention the Coens, because Jeunet is making films now that are sort of ""Raising-Arizonaish"" in their comic-book-imposed-on-reality extravagant, comic style, but will hopefully achieve the maturity of the Coens, in his deeper outlook to turn out something like ""The Man Who Wasn't There.""Getting down to more specifics, ""Amelie"" reminded me of Louis Malle's classic 1960 film ""Zazie Dans Le Metro,"" which also is split down the middle, magnificent for the first half, BORING & cliched in the second. However, Catherine Demongeot (who, bizarrely enough, Nabokov once said would've been the PERFECT LOLITA had he been allowed to pick one young enough to add the proper amount of repulsion to Kubrick's film) in ""Zazie"" is a 10 year old girl, & much less interesting a character to red-blooded heterosexual hairy-chested men (such as yours truly) than the SUPER-cute, 'BIG SHOED' (above & below), starlet of Jeunet's film: Audrey Tautou. On one level, the film is a love affair between Jeunet's camera & Tautou, in the time honored tradtion of Sternberg/Dietrich, Powell/Kerr, Hitchcock/Hedren, Godard/Karina, De Palma/Nancy Allen, etc., the angles he uses, the way he frames her, the endless close-ups, all of these things are the work of an artist in love with his subject (whether there's a 'love relatonship' in 'real life' is beside the point), and all the audience is thankful for it.On another level (again reminding me of ""Zazie""), the film takes you on quite a TURBOCHARGED, non-cliched 'tour' of picturesque areas of Paris, & is maybe the best advertising the old 'city of Romance' has had for years. It takes the eyes & sensibilities of masters like Jeunet & Delbonnel to get these shots with just the proper amount of irreverence incoroporated (by what they choose to show and omit), & then ruin them by overplaying sappy annoying accordion music for way too long towards the latter, weaker third of the flick.DEFIITELY RECOMMENDED, but like another technically dazzling, relatively popular (though not a 'smash hit' like this one) French film before it Leconte's ""The Girl on the Bridge,"" a little too short on substance and TRUE ROMANCE (as opposed to the cliched, NON-EXISTENT kind displayed in the film; check out Renoir's ""Picnic on the Grass"" or Jacques Becker's ""Antoine et Antoinette"" if you want to see a similarly whimsical, semi-fantasy film nevertheless displaying the EXISTENT KIND OF 'ROMANCE' IN INNER SENSIBILITY if not in actual, same-story realistic possibility) to give the 'HELL OF FRANCE' its proper artistic due, and in consequence become as great (in the all-important artistic realm) as let's say Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player."" And one more thing before I leave you with your questionable tastes in without a doubt loving fake, 'non-depressing' fantasty films too much: next time you see the film, you should be aware that a sizeable portion of the film is, among other things, a dead-on satire of Hitchcock's overrated classic ""Rear Window."""	3.0	"""There's no hell, there's only France"""	2001-12-15	6	3	3

I am quite glad that I saw this in French first, because I feel like I really connected with the storyline, I had to pay attention to every miniscule detail to fully comprehend the plot. Amelie is a normal girl, but she views the world much differently than most of us do. She is a girl that likes to help other people and sometimes causes more harm than anything else, but it makes her that much more endearing because she tried to make something better.This movie is beautifully written, acted, and directed. You will watch a scene, and remember the dialogue for days. Amelie is funny most of the time, but I noticed a strong overtone of sadness throughout most of the scenes. Amelie, while funny and charming, has been through much more in her young life, then most of us have in our ripe age. Sometimes she appears to be bitter, impatient, and angry, but mostly she looks sad; like a little girl who has lost her puppy...and that is what makes the movie. She doesn't dwell on being sad, she tries to be happy. This movie is beautiful and is highest on my list of favorites.	5.0	Wow	2006-04-20	3	1	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1XBYZX09V1OB4	Valerie J. Saturen	"Amelie is, without a doubt, one of the most heartwarming films ever made. A painfully shy waitress, Amelie Poulain happens upon a chance discovery that changes her life. She vows to become a ""regular do-gooder,"" touching the lives of those around her and, in one hilarious scene, giving the mean-spirited grocer Colignon his just desserts for picking on his slow-witted assistant Lucien. Nonetheless, Amelie remains within the inner world of her rich imagination and seldom ventures out to forge real relationships with others. When she encounters Nino, an unusual young man with whom she feels a natural affinity, she longs for a relationship but can't bring herself to approach him, instead concocting elaborate ""stratagems"" to bring them together.Audrey Tautou is absolutely adorable as Amelie, and the artful cinematography, quirky characters, and whimsical story come together in a wonderful film that celebrates the magic of everyday life. Amelie sees the world with a childlike sense of wonder that is thoroughly contagious.The film is full of quirky, idiosyncratic characters, from the neurotic father who spends his days tending to a garden gnome to the Glass Man, a gifted painter who hasn't left his apartment in 20 years. Nino, like Amelie herself, is a dreamer, preoccupying himself with a scrapbook of pictures he sweeps out from under a photo booth. Before that, a co-worker informs Amelie, his pastime was tape recording funny laughs.Amelie is the kind of movie that can be watched dozens of times without losing its magic. It's an infallible antidote to the blues that will warm your heart and bring a smile to your face every time."	5.0	Will Melt Your Heart	2008-02-17	1	1	0

Amelie goes beyond the whimsical into the absolutely fantastic.  With humor and poignancy, the story unfolds.  Amelie is the lonely child of a distant father and neurotic mother.  As she stands childlike in the midst of a young adulthood, she observes human tragedy from the window of her apartment.  Upon finding a box of children's treasures in the dark space behind the wall of her bathroom, she begins to try to find the person who would have put it there.  This is the beginning of her emergence as a would-be fairy godmother, and her deeds become the portal by which she may be able to join with the rest of the human race as one of them.The film is magnificently beautiful, and the casting perfect.  Tautou combines the self-knowledge of an introspective young woman with the disingenuousness of an imaginative loner to create an unforgettably charming character.The DVD is rich with extra features.  What I found particularly compelling was Tautou's audition clip, as the actress seemed so much more contemporary and earthy than the character, but then was able to slip on a coat of whimsy even at that early stage.  Also noteworthy is the interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who says that he aims to make stories about the extraordinary rather than the ordinary (think City of Lost Children).

The cinematography was mindblowing. The direction was superb and left me wondering at his imagination. Every little scene, every little nuance was so meaningful and so well thought out. The humor depicted in the film was very refreshingly different from the normal below-the-belt stuff of Hollywood and there was a wide smile on my face when I wasn't in splits. Such a movie hits you only once in a lifetime. So those of you who haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?	5.0	A triumph!!	2002-01-28	4	3	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1NSHD4YCL5DV3	"Vish Iyer ""wish_1979"""	This is a modern-day fairy-tale of a simple city-girl, in a seemingly idyllic backdrop, which actually is ruffled is a lot of ways, due to its rather `disturbed' characters, whose lives, while this beady-eyed waitress tries to solve, finds herself in a similar situation, where she herself ends up needing some help.AMELIE can be considered a story of stories, tied together by just a single link, in the form of a girl called Amilie. Living in her own shell, this girl discovers the Samaritan in her, when she successfully tracks down and gives the previous occupant of her apartment, a box containing objects of his childhood playthings that she accidentally finds in her house, and brings out the tears of joy in his eyes, as he reminisces his days of childhood, watching and feeling the contents of the box. This experience overwhelms her, and she decides that she would now on, do whatever she could, to straighten other people's lives, and herein lies the stories, which make the story of the movie.The movie is made up of bits and pieces, showing the rather weird nature of the various people, that Amilie tries to help. The magic of the movie lies in this aspect of how beautifully each character is depicted, with some handicap or the other disturbing their lives, which this lonely but good-willed girl tries to fix. Be it the `obsessed' neighbor, who is more than happy to read out letters from her deal husband, or the painter, who is so touchy about how names are pronounced, or the bullying vegetable-vendor, always belittling his hapless assistant, or the loveless boyfriend and the loveless hotel-waitresses, or the young man, who sifts for torn photographs of people, and reassembles and sticks them in the album that he maintains of reassembled photos of people he doesn't even know, or even Amilie's own father, who is obsessed with his ceramic gnome, each one of them is so carefully and delicately defined, that it overshadows the ambiguity in the story, which is what it intends to do, in the first place.Though the story has a nave fairy-tale-like feel to it, it actually turns out otherwise, by its messed up characters. Hence, the movie, far from being a sappy and drab tale of feel-good, is actually quite an interesting take on the most unusual and uncanny facets of the human nature. Moreover, the slick cinematography and the music-video like feel of the movie, coupled with the swanky voice-over comments make it not only a visually splendid movie, but also an exciting joyride, with a lot of areas worth pondering on.AMILIE has a mischievous undertone, with a visually pleasing and amiable exterior. When one sees beyond the pleasing epidermis of the movie, it provides for interesting food for thought, when it comes to analyzing the bizarre characters in it. For its glossy appearance, or for its underlying unapparent starkness, or for its feel-good aura, or just for its wacky imagination, AMILIE is an entertainer with brains and brawns.	5.0	SMART ENTERTAINER	2004-04-07	7	5	2

B0000640VO	Amelie	A195PGKC8HUD1T	watersplash	I saw this film at the theater with my father and my brother. I didn't really understand what the movie was about at first, but I had my eyes glued to the screen because of its captivating cinematography. The film was rich in colours--it was never dull.It was only a year later did I understand this film. My brother bought a DVD, so I decided to watch it again. Along with its cinematography, I found out that the story too, was never dull. It's truly original and enchanting, and it's not always that I see films like this one. One thing that makes this film original is the fact that the circumstances in the story are weird (sometimes even impossible), touching, and funny at the same time. The cast of characters make this film even more charming. Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz have perfect chemistry that I got attached to Amelie Poulain and Nino Quincampoix for a very long time.Great cast, great story, great colours, great director... it all sums up to a great film!	5.0	Amelie Poulain is weird yet charming	2006-04-30	4	2	2

It really took me off guard how much I liked this movie, heartwarming/charming would definately describe the plot. What really got me was the FANTASTIC directing from the director who also made ""City of Lost Children""(Can't remember his name right now...French...that's all I know), I mean it was just incredibly well done. Also a couple parts made me laugh out loud, which is always a nice suprise from a movie where you weren't expecting it.

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1O60Q7LBN4MQ	Wendy Schroeder	I though it was a charming film. A young woman who is an daydreaming introvert (perhaps in part due to being raised by self-absorbed parents and having no friends since she was home-schooled). She moves away from home as soon as she is old enough. She finds a box in her apartment that belonged to a boy who lived there in the 50's. Am&eacute;lie goes on a crusading mission as a do-gooder when she finds the now middle age man. Why? Because she enjoyed seeing his reaction of being reunited with his lost childhood treasure. During this time of her life, she develops a crush on a man similar to her and tries to hook up with him.	5.0	Such a simple story but such a delight to watch. Funny and touching.	2006-08-13	4	3	1

I feel very much like the character in the movie who keeps to herself and is hesitant about intimate human interaction. Beyond that, though, the cinematography was breathtaking, from the vivid colors to the lively music. The love story was quite an unconventional one and there was also a sub-plot of mystery running just underneath the surface. Audrey Tautou definitely steals the show here.	5.0	Audrey Tautou will charm the pants off you!	2011-02-19	0	0	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	AJGR9XRTYIQ20	Wet Mars	"It's all about what Jean-Pierre Jeunet likes and dislikes. He's turned himself into a mediocre-looking girl with big impressive eyes and quite sexy lips, who looks better with that particular hairdo, to express some of his phantasies. Imagine same movie with Amelie replaced by Amello. Amelie is kind of a petit voleur, a con artist of little things mistakenly called love? This could easily be mistaken for a TV serial, or a music video, void of music. The movie is so confusing, yet Amelie's heart pumps so hard and it shows, even to the least aware, as if the rest of the movie does not matter, suddenly it becomes obvious - she's in love. Sketches of an artist scattered on the floor across a 7 bedroom apartment, including the bathroom and the basement storage cell. Why not shatter the movie into a thousand and one pieces (just like those torn-apart photos) and try selling as individual posters perhaps? Would probably make a great photography album called: ""Delicious. Lost. Amelie"". ""Delicatessen"" was great; ""The City of Lost Children"" was not so great to creepy, even slightly pedophilic; ""Amelie"" is a waste of time for a great deal of the not necessarily unintelligent people. For those who will be searching for a matching music for this music video, I can suggest, try ""Enigma"" or something like that; perhaps you can create a youtube masterpiece by adding music to this movi(e)deo sans musique. It does feel like a short music video after all the patiently watching thing is over. Yet those, who are under influence of some substance, could as well enjoy it even without music... Reading one-star reviews before purchasing a movie sure helps a lot in most cases. I think I'm gonna (try to) sell it (back) on Amazon.com.

The opening can almost be seen as a little Wes Anderson-ish, only GOOD. It takes on a life of its own, and it can only be viewed in french. As with most subtittle films, you eventually don't even notice, but the beauty of the language just adds subconscienciously to the wonder and charm of this. I cant say enough about it. It has its own world, yet is terribly familiar, and is the CLOSEST any film I have seen has ever come to showing how people think, what they like and why, and the tricks our minds can play. You leave thinking you were sitting in that cafe just watching a true, heartwarming tale that is just too good to be false. The music, cinematography, story, everything just makes you love life and fall in love. All together, there is about 20 seconds of actual sexually explicit material, but the overall good of the film gets it by and is more than forgivable to the faint of heart.

But she is shy about meeting her own true love. She hatches a scheme, a complicated mystery tour to catch the man of her dreams.This is why I love the movies. Amelie is not your everyday dark film of murder, mayhem and ugly behavior; this is a dream world and the beautiful place I want to be taken too when I suspend reality at the door.I watch in wonder at how the filmmaker embellishes such a simple story to create a delightfully rich tapestry, ripe with incredible images and subtleties of life. This is an excellent example of how all the cinema arts can be directed to create total magic.Amelie is so full of originality, whimsy and nuance in this modern world of fast people and obvious everything. It is such a pleasure to be captivated by something that I would call a modern work of art.This is a soft, lovable, puppy dog of a film.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AL7DU1ZFQH0CV	Wim Chalmet	I had the luck having seen previous movie of Carot such as &quot;Delicatessen&quot; and &quot;City of lost children&quot;, so I knew more or less which visual style of movie I was about to witness. I had no idea about the plot though, so I was very willing to let myself be surprised. And surprised, I was.The movie opens with a 4 minute mixture of complete factual but not to the matter enumeration of events such as somebody removing one name from his address book and a fly (which flaps his wings at 14.670 beats per minute) being squatted by a car. And all of a sudden, with a pace that you have rarely seen in any movie, you are thrown right into the life of Amelie.You will go through the life of Amelie from baby to adult. The very many details of this life do not stop to surprise you (her father thinking she has a hart problem, and the discovery of a box filled with children toys on the day that Lady Di dies).What is very special about this movie , besides the excellent plot, is the visually overwhelming scenes. Carot really makes every scene work for themselves like he has done in his previous movies.The biggest problem is that it is very hard to describe what this movie really is about. Is it about a girl who is unlucky and tries to help other people find their luck? Or is the movie just telling us the story of the life of a girl and what happens during her life?It is up to you - the viewer - to decide on such questions. The movie just gives hints at what life could be. It is definitely a must see if you want to get away from the typical Hollywood blockbuster for a while.	5.0	A visual feast that is hard to describe but easy to watch.	2001-12-31	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2QG71ZQIL9K54	W. Murray	I loved the artistry of this movie - that people can acurately represent their vision of beauty always impresses me. So much cheerful color saturation that made each scene like a painting, every inch of what you see is lovely - little inanimate objects come to life, creative concepts abound.I enjoyed the plot emmensly. It is possible? -to unclench one's grip on reality for just a moment and watch how an imaginative recluse might see the world on a good day, or what it is like to fall in love - or might such sencerity make people cringe? I do not find this concept a stretch, for my part there was much in the movie I identified with. Sure I have my bad days too, but this movie was not the time nor place to explore these thought and visions.Are we allowed to be this cheerful? People seem to equate carefree and sunny with vapid and immature. Do we only have sunny weeks like these in childhood? Is a woman's sexuality childlike if she expresses shyness, imagination and sensitivity? I certainly hope not. Some my be sceptical of all these elements - Sure there have been many examples of sapp laden movies that have attempted to &quot;warm our hearts,&quot; in the past, but I would not put Amelie in that catagory. It's a matter of personal taste I suppose - you can't please all of the people all of the time. But as I understand it, many people got the sugar rush from this movie I did (note sugar, not sacrine).If it isn't already obvious, this movie is non-representational. It seems to bother a few people that the &quot;real&quot; Paris was not shown, but I think most people are aware that Paris is not saturated in sepia tone and accompanied with constant accordian music.

B0000640VO	Amelie	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	I delight in films about vulnerable people finding redemption, and this is one such film. Amelie is a fragile creature, a young woman afraid of the world, too wounded by life to love and be loved, who one day serendipitously stumbles upon a child's box of toys and trinkets that will set in motion the events that promise her salvation. She begins finding ways to help people, but only ever from a distance. When she is granted the opportunity to open herself to life and love, however, will she run away, or will she take the plunge?Here we have a fascinating tale that celebrates the giftedness, uniqueness and specialness of every person and every moment. In an extraordinarily magical way, director Jeunet causes us to weep and laugh at the ironies of life and the blessedness of truly living it. Cinematically, this is inventive and visually entrancing. Audrey Tatou is charming as the character at the centre of Jeunet's surreal yet totally believable world.	5.0	Masterpiece of recent French cinema	2004-02-07	2	1	1

A man by the name of Lucien works as an assistant for the grocer, Collignon. Lucien is degraded and humiliated by his boss everyday. Am&eacute;lie decides to take action. As she walks down the stairs of her apartment building one day, she sees a set of keys hanging on a door. The keys belonged to Collignon. Am&eacute;lie decides to return the keys to Collignon but witnesses a scene where Collignon humiliates Lucien in front of a bunch of customers. Am&eacute;lie, disgusted, goes to a locksmith to make a copy of the key to Collignon's front door. She returns to the apartment building and puts the keys back into the key hole. As she leaves, you can see the copy she made in her pocket. Now, it's time for revenge. While Collignon works at the grocery store, Am&eacute;lie sneaks into his apartment with the copy key she made. Switching things around the house, Am&eacute;lie delivers a hilarious comeuppance. From replacing door handles to switching out shoes to switching out light bulbs, she practically drives Collignon insane. Now guess who's in charge. That's right. Lucien gives the orders now. Am&eacute;lie also meets a woman by the name of Madeleine Wallace, the concierge. Her husband had left her to run off with another woman taking with him almost all her money. Mrs. Wallace is hurt till this very day, remembering her husband's betrayal as his portrait is on her wall. Am&eacute;lie tries to think up a way to help her, but can't. Until...she sees a letter from Mrs. Wallace's husband. She opens the letter and reads exactly what she doesn't want Mrs. Wallace to see. With a great idea in mind, Am&eacute;lie cuts out all the words of the letter. She pastes the words on top of a piece of paper, photocopies it, dips it in tea, and puts it up to dry. And when she was done, the letter looked as if it was written a long time ago. When Mrs. Wallace received the letter, she was thrilled and very happy. She had read the letter that said that her husband regretted the fact that he had left her and he still loved her. Am&eacute;lie had made another person happy. What about her own happiness?Am&eacute;lie meets Nino Quicampoix, an intriguing young man who collects the photos of anonymous individuals. One day, his album of photos ends up in her hands. She decides to return it and sets up a scenario for him to find the album. Nino, interested in this mystery woman, decides to find out who she is. As she watches Nino from afar, she gradually falls in love with him. During this time, they showed many surrealistic images that fascinated me. One scene I enjoyed watching that was when Nino was sleeping in his room. Nino woke up to hearing the voices of the passport photos clipped to his lamp. The man in the photos were talking to him and giving him conflicting advice as to how he should approach Am&eacute;lie. That could not really happen in real life, but I found it amusing to have photos talk to you and give you advice. Another scene that intrigued me was the scene where Am&eacute;lie's suicidal goldfish was freaking out her mother. It's true that fish sometimes try to suicide, but not like how Am&eacute;lie's goldfish attempted at suicide. The goldfish was Am&eacute;lie's only friend, but her mother couldn't take it anymore. And so, the goldfish was thrown into the river. I felt that this scene was symbolic in a way that Am&eacute;lie was left with no friends and no one who could understand her.Am&eacute;lie is a movie that defies all boundaries of imagination and lets the viewer experience things that could never happen in the real world. Am&eacute;lie awakens the child-like part of us as we realize what we can do with our lives to make it more fun and enjoyable. This film also makes us think about how we can help others like how such a selfless, lonely girl like Am&eacute;lie can. I feel that this movie has taught me how to become a better person and to not be so selfless as to neglect myself either. Am&eacute;lie is a wonderful movie that lets its viewers see the little things that we normally miss or take granted for.	4.0	One of a Kind	2006-10-12	3	3	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A2VBP9TO6W09TR	Yann	"In my humble opinion, what made this picture so great for me was the fact to be so surprised on the first time i watched it : do you know whats going on ? Do you know how many scenes ? Do you know if this is a love story, a comedy, or something else ? No matter ! When you answer ""NO"", you can be sure to appreciate Amelie. This movie is a tale, it could be a cartoon : the big success in France suggests that most of the French understood that and didn't care about grey realism. Anyway it doesn't seem necessary to get a childish soul to appreciate Amelie; you can appreciate also the mood, the visuals, the score and why not respect the hard poetic work delivered by the scenarist and underlined by all these different scenes crossing each other to display a wonderful movie. Thanks a lot, Mister Jeunet ! Amelie took care of her neighborhood, and many moviegoers took care of this masterpiece."	5.0	excellent surprise	2002-09-26	1	1	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A29SHFBU5O9BWO	Yan Timanovsky	No doubt we'd be more suspicious of a good-natured film like this were it not made outside the US by people who can make us believe.  Audrey Tatou is the prettiest and most expressive female face to make an entrance on the international scene in a long time.  This is a beautiful, whimsical, and yes, quirky (yet not irksome) movie about loneliness, imagination, love, and courage.The lush, glowing red, green, and blue of Montmarte creates the kind of Parisian fantasy and fantastic Paris everyone conjures in their dreams.  Only talented (relative)unknowns can get away with performances like this one, and they make waiting for them worthwile.  The art direction, editing, and effects are also first-rate.The DVD has the usual set of goodies like director's commentary, interviews, and other junk.  Widescreen version was crisp and vibrant.  So see this movie and allow yourself to be seduced by its charm.	5.0	Magical Movie	2002-08-22	4	3	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3BFHV8TSZJAQU	Yarica	I never thought that I would like this movie. I was wrong: it grows on you. The narrator is so unique, the seemingly mundane things that are reported tend to bear relevance to the development of the plot. I laughed so much during the narration of Amelie's early life. This film is all about caring about other people's well-being, being true to yourself and taking risks in reaching out to others and forming relationships. Amelie's introverted character made me exasperated at times, but the film finishes with a classic alls-well-that-ends-well. It's a quirky interesting gem of a foreign film. :)	5.0	Such a delighful French film!	2013-07-15	0	0	0

B0000640VO	Amelie	A1XHXF10BRB21A	"""yhui"""	Amelie is the first foreign movie among those I have watched which I think is great. A funny, dramatic and romantic plot. The storyline is not complicated but still very gripping. Excellent photography and film shots. The colors used throughout the whole movie are incredible, making it just like an art film. It is the kind of movie that you want to sit down, relax and watch with your lover. If you haven't watched this movie in the theater, be sure you don't miss it on video.	5.0	One of my most favorite movies	2002-07-06	3	1	2
B0000640VO	Amelie	A1J703AP9TJX0Q	Yi Chieh	"Seen this just once and it's definately one of the best foregin movies ever made.A introvert adult (played superbly by Audrey Tautou)caused by her early childhood days caused her to close herself in a world of her own dreams and wishes. A destiny chance of finding a ""Old Childhood Box"" in her flat with old toys triggered a search for it's original owner. Leading to tears and joys when the owner receives the box but without knowing the Angel that delivered it.Thereafter helping to unit 2 lonely souls in the cafe she works sparks off a hilarious outcome. Then doing the ""Mission Impossible"" of sneaking into the Grocery Store Man's house to play a few tricks on him for being so harsh to his ""slightly handicapped worker"". Lastly, create an ""old vintage love letter"" to bring a lonely woman's heart back to life.Despite all that effort, realising she had help fix other people's lives all but her own. Unable to express her feelings for ""the one"" she saw at the train station (played by Mathieu Kassovitz). She decides that life was destined to be forever her and her own dream world until ""the one's shoe"" (i.e. a collection of old passport photo book) was left behind and picked up by her""As the ""Sleeping Beauty"" decides to return it to ""Prince Charming"" through a very funny and mysterious way. The finale takes place when the ""Prince"" comes up the tower and finally rescues the ""Princess"". Definately for almost all to enjoy (18+) and especially to those introvet ones, may this finale happen to you in time to come! Be patient..."	5.0	She WILL change your life....	2002-03-20	4	3	1

B0000640VO	Amelie	A2C14E77WUOG0B	"""zelda64gal"""	When I decided to see this movie, I was at a personal low.  I almost didn't see it for that reason, but went anyway.  It was the best thing I could have done for myself because I walked out of the theater with a big smile.  This is the most beautiful film I have seen in the year 2001.  It deserves to win best picture and should definitely get atleast a nomination.  It was witty, original, funny, and romantic.  The Storyline was good even if it was simple and the acting superb.  It is a must-see movie and definitely one of those movies you just can't miss.  It gets a perfect rating from me!	5.0	Best film of 2001	2002-02-02	4	3	1
B0000640VO	Amelie	ACDZDAW1ZJ304	"""zimri-lim"""	"French films, while often excellent, are something of an acquired taste and some of the essence can get lost in the translation (both cultural and linguistic).  This film, however, transcends such difficulties and is immensely enjoyable and heart-warming.While like many other French films this is very whimsical, it is so well performed and directed that only the very hardest hearted would not find the charm of this film irresistable. Part of the reason for this is down to the remarkable central performance of Audrey Tautou as ""Amelie"". Her entire performance seems to be more mimed than acted and seems to do without dialogue to a great degree.  This works well due to her excellent acting abilities as well as some outstanding direction.The plot is based around an unashamedly romantic story concerning our heroine; the acting skill and direction give this film a quirkyness and zest which really set it apart.I enjoyed this film immensely and felt enriched from having watched it.  Definitely one of the filmic highlights of the past year and very highly recommended."	5.0	Original Film Making at its Best.  *****	2002-11-07	4	4	0
B0000640VO	Amelie	A3TXM29WDNM9U0	"""zooey2000"""	"Many people have referred to this moving as a gem.  It is, I must say, uplifting and cinematically gorgeous.  The opening sequence alone is beautiful.  The plot itself, while traditional -- lonely person falls in love -- while not full of the typical ""twists and turns,"" is sparkling with creativity.  All of the characters are well-developed and enticing.  Some of the delights include: the garden gnome Amelie steals from her father's house and sends on trips to other countries to convince the widower that he needs to see the world; Mathieu Kassovitz's character, who collects ruined pictures from the photo booths around Paris (the fact that he works both at a porn shop and the Foire du Trone, a fair that does have the run-down, slightly dangerous feeling of Coney Island is also funny); the pair that work at the local fruit stand -- the evil boss whom Amelie winds up playing a number of pranks on in a delightfully amusing scene; and his employee, the sweet-but-stupid boy who loves the fruit.  Probably the most interesting and most crucial relationship in the movie is the one that develops between Amelie, a girl who is charming but shy and ultimately slightly frightened to really be in the world, and the ""glass man,"" the old painter who lives in her building.  It is ultimately through the old man that Amelie comes to realize that she must seize life; simulaneously, she tries to do the same for him.  I have mentioned a couple of brilliant parts of the plot, but there are many more.  (The circumstances surrounding Amelie's mother's death are hilarious, as is the reason that Amelie was not allowed to go to school as a child.  The people at the cafe are all full of life as well.  In fact, the character development is probably one of the most compelling things about the film.)  Being from France, I suppose I am obliged to say that I am glad that a non-Hollywood movie has captured America's attention -- in Seattle, where I was living last year, the movie played for 6 months at the same movie theater.  It is ultimately a romantic dramedy -- not wholly comedic, because it is also profoundly touching (the type of movie people say changed their life, even when it probably didn't).  Audrey Tautou is a soon-to-be-legend in France, but let's not forget Mathieu Kassovitz, who's character is also fabulous.  Tautou is wide-eyed, mysterious, and coquette.  Kassovitz plays his role in a subdued manner that makes the romance between the two all the more wonderfully serendipitous."	5.0	Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain	2001-11-09	2	0	2
