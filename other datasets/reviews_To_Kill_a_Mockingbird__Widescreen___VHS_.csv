0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1LBAC84TLIGAX	"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF"""	Much like the book, I didn't like this movie because it was just so boring and unexciting. The characters are as uncompelling as they were in the book and I really felt no compassion for the social injustice tragedies that were in the story because of how boring this movie and the book are. There is almost no excitement to be derived from this shamefully bad movie, the storyline is just groan-worthy, the characters are groan-worthy, the premise is boring, the fight scene at the end was lame, and just about everything else was lame, just like the terrible book. This isn't one of the worst of the worst films I've ever seen (That distinction is for Happy Feet and Like Mike). If you think I'm some kind of racist because I hate the book and movie (Much how people think I'm atheist because of my review for The Bible Game) you're wrong, because I'm not. This movie just sucks along with the book because they're just so freaking boring! Avoid this movie please, if you truly like movies.	2.0	BORING, JUST LIKE THE FREAKING BOOK! 4.5 OUT OF 10	2007-12-22	49	2	47

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A31UE0LJBKCHUA	A Customer	When we read To Kill A Mockingbird in English I last year, I found it to be terrible.  However, maybe it was because I was being forced to read it and I hate being told what to do.  Maybe it was just Harper Lee's style of writing.  Maybe if I read it again after seeing the movie I would appreciate it.  Or maybe I really do just hate it.  But the movie is incredible.  Gregory Peck's Atticus is completely admirable, and Scout &amp; Boo Radley are two of the most innocent and adorable characters.  They're a trip, especially Scout!  The trial scene is absolutely moving and makes you want to stand up against the injustices of the world, and the scenes with hate crimes can be downright scary.  If you're like me and hated reading the book, RENT THE MOVIE.  It won't dissapoint.	4.0	Dare I say, better than the book?	2001-04-17	5	1	4
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	"{The only reason I gave it a mere four stars is that the book got five.}My earlier review of the book amounted to little more than ""rah rah rah, go read this!"" Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. ""Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era."" That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the ""deep dark Southern secrets"" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.Oh, and this is purely coincidental. Later in this newsletter you'll see ""The One-Plot Wonder,"" which I wrote over a year ago but chose to rerun. I made this decision long before watching TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But this book, and this movie, are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about. It has many plots. It's what we should aspire to every time we write."	4.0	To Kill a Mockingbird	2006-08-28	6	3	3
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The film begins with a child opening a box with toys that dates this story to the 1930s. The lawyer takes his payment in goods, cash is scarce. This little girl seems to be a tomboy. The kids are warned about the local maniac chained in his house. There is an old lady who is cranky. We hear the family history. People don't dress for the hot weather. The Judge asks Atticus Finch to represent a defendant. These kids just wander around (to present a view of life). Does anyone watch them? That lady does not wear a hat and gloves. ""Scout"" seems to have a behavior problem. Atticus tells about his first gun. He tells ""Scout"" about the need for proper deportment in school.Then a mad dog appears in the street. Atticus returns to shoot it, he is known as a good shot. Later he meets the wife of the defendant. A man shows up for a scary scene. Jem finds a trinket. ""Scout"" has more behavior problems. Atticus explains his legal work. A man patches a hole in a tree. Jem found things in that hole. At night some cars arrive at the jail. Atticus bars the door, he defends it with moral strength. His daughter's presence turns the men back. [Believable?] The courtroom is packed solid, but there is room on the second floor. The trial begins with testimony from Sheriff Tait. Mr. Ewell tells what he saw. Lawyer Finch shows Ewell is left-handed. May Ellen testifies about what happened. Finch questions her.Defendant Robinson tells how his left arm was lamed due to an accident on the job when he was twelve years old. [No child labor laws?] May Ellen repeats her claim. [You can judge her credibility.] Mr Robinson takes the stand and tells what happened. Will he be believed? He felt sorry for her? Lawyer Finch said there was no physical evidence for the crime. The defendant has a lame left arm. Was this crime due to the violation of society's rules. Can the word of a Negro be taken against two white people? Finch asks for justice for his client. The jury takes two hours to decide on guilty. Later Finch learns that Robinson was shot while trying to escape.Jem and Tina May walk home in the dark for a final dramatic scene. They are attacked by a strange man. Jem is hurt. Mr. Ewell is found dead. Who rescued Jem? [Is the ending believable?] Sheriff Tait decides that Ewell fell on his knife. This case is closed. An example of poetic justice? [Would Atticus want his child to be friends with a grown man who has emotional problems?

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AQ8DU6XVA3USJ	"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator"""	This would be a wonderful film for parents to watch with children old enough to understand the depth of its message. Good and evil are clearly drawn, and the values of justice and humanity portrayed with rare and memorable strength.Reading Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel had a huge impact on me as a teenager...I never forgot, as Atticus says to Scout, that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.Horton Foote won an Oscar for his screenplay, which is so faithful to the book. Set in depression era Alabama, it's seen through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, beautifully played by Mary Badham, and the sensitivity of director Mulligan's vision is remarkable.Prejudice is the theme that runs through the story, from the harrowing court case of Tom (an amazing performance by Brock Peters), falsely accused of rape, to the demonization of Boo  (played by Robert Duvall, in his screen debut...he's intensely moving as this innocent and silent man).Russell Harlan's superb cinematography should be seen in the widescreen version to be fully appreciated, and Elmer Bernstein's Americana style score adds so much to the film.Gregory Peck's Oscar winning performance is magnificent. His Atticus is a hero of immense proportions, with compassion, integrity, and humility...and it's one of the many reasons I think this powerful classic deserves to be in every video library.	5.0	a great classic film	2002-05-27	20	19	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AGEIT17HENDIS	Alfred Johnson	"This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar. That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.The name Atticus Finch (Peck's role) as the liberal (for that southern locale) lawyer committed to the rule of law had a certain currency in the 1960's as a symbol for those southern whites who saw that Jim Crow had to go. Here Finch is the appointed lawyer for a black man accused of raping a white women of low origin- the classic `white trash' depicted in many a film and novel. Finch earnestly, no, passionately in his understated manner, attempts to defend this man, a brave act in itself under the circumstances.Needless to say an all white jury of that black man's `peers' nevertheless convicts him out of hand. In the end the black man tries to escape and is killed in the process. In an earlier scenario Finch is pressed into guard duty at the jailhouse in order to head off a posse of `white trash' elements who are bend on doing `justice' their way- hanging him from a lynching tree. On a mere false accusation of a white woman this black man is doomed whichever way he turns. Sound familiar?The other part of the story concerns the reactions by Finch's motherless son and tomboyish daughter to the realities of social life, Southern style. That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the ""Negro"" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film. What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids. The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here. But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together. Bravo Peck. Kudos to Harper Lee."	5.0	Alabama, God Damn	2008-05-27	0	0	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3NQU1649SH0Q4	"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,"""	Summer in Macon.  &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; opens with narration, straight from the source novel, because only the novel would do, and at once we're catapulted into the small-town South at the trough of the  Depression.  Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) has to defend a black man  unjustly accused of raping a white girl, and along the way he has to fend  off a lynching party; such were those times.  Mostly the movie is told from  the point of view of Atticus' two children, Scout and Jem, and their  gradual moral awakening that life in their little town is not always a  matter of please-and-thank-you.This is a deliberate movie, almost  courtly in the way it unfolds, and I only hope that it holds the attention  spans of today's MTV generation.  To me, the languid pace seems perfectly  at home with small towns, summer heat, southern courtliness, and Gregory  Peck's quiet integrity as an actor and his tendency to slightly underplay a  scene.  Look for a very young Robert Duvall as &quot;Boo&quot; Radley.  Elmer Bernstein's musical score is a treat of Americana.	5.0	Quiet Integrity	2000-05-14	5	5	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A103NWTLDIFTQX	"Amazon Customer ""alus80"""	To Kill A Mockingbird was released in 1962 by Universal Studios. It is a drama in black and white with a running time of 2hrs./10mins. Directed by Robert Mulligan.  This movie also won an Academy Award.To Kill A Mockingbird takes place in an old southern town during the depression.  Atticus, portrayed by Gregory Peck, is a lawyer. Atticus is a widower raising a son, Jem, portrayed by Phillip Alford and a daughter, Scout, portrayed by Mary Bedham. Atticus takes on the case of a black man accused of assaulting and raping a white woman.The remarkableness of this film is how the children are exposed to prejudice, but keep their innocence and never become judgemental. The children's impression and admiration for their father grows throughtout the movie.  Atticus shares insightful things with them such as, &quot;you never really understand a man until you put yourself in his shoes and walk around in them,  also, &quot;it is a sin to kill a mockingbird for they only mean to please.&quot;  &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is enjoyable and educational and it explores stereotypical prejudices of the deep south with many emotional experiences.I highly recommend this movie for everyone.A bit of trivia--This is Robert Duvalls first movie.

The young actress who played Scout was also from Alabama, Birmingham, in fact, near where I am from.  Mary Badham was fantastic.  She reminded me of my older sister, overalls, short hair cut and all.  I remember going to Birmingham when I was a little girl to see this movie when it first came out.  Going out to a movie was a big deal for a nine-year old and seeing a little girl about my age from my area appear in a Hollywood movie put me over the moon.  As I saw this movie again I relived all of these feelings.  This is a wonderful movie no matter where you are from.  There are no car chases and while guns figure in to the plot there are no shoot-em ups. There is a bit of a mystery and big scare for Scout and her brother.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ASRJEN2WHW64Y	Amazon Customer	Most of us are familiar with Harper Lee's classical novel by this name about depression-era racism in the south seen through a child's eyes, so the first question that comes to mind about this movie is 'does it do justice to the book?', and the answer is a resounding 'yes!'.Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations. His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally. Brock Peters is right-on as the accused negro, with James Anderson doing a phenomenal job as the villian, Bob Ewell.Although this a story which is probably better fitted for a book than a movie, it does not lose any of its heart on-screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote. Although filmed on a holywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly.The Bonus Features on the DVD include the academy award best-actor acceptance speech by Gregory Peck, as well as an interesting recent interview with Mary Badham.In the Two-Disc Special Edition the bonus features include an extensive interview with Gregory Peck, as well as a long documentary about the movie and its production.

The Atticus character is the ideal father figure, the kids are fun and innocent, and the world is damaged.  The acting is top notch for this time period (especially the adults).  The cinematography was also very beautiful, with a couple complaints... A few of the court room scenes look like they are heavily cropped images, or maybe they were filmed on bad cameras with small film.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1W9JOFE6F89FB	Amber MacDonald	This is a classic story, the film is very moving. It portrays imagination, struggle, friendship, and many aspects of life that seem fresh, though the movie is very old. The story is told from the unique prospective of a well to do family during the great depression, that alone sets it apart from most films. There are several plot elements that come full-circle by the end of the movie, and show that people can be, and are capable of doing both beautiful and ugly things. I think that far fewer people have seen this movie than I had originally thought. Everyone needs to though. It is an excellent film about taking a stand, friendship, trust, learning, and growing, among many other things. It is exciting to me to see this movie given the attention that it deserves.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I've been intrigued by the idea of `To Kill a Mockingbird' for some time now.  Knowing that it is rendered one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time had perked my interest early on but it became the movie I wanted to see but never got around to.  It's hard to find this little treasure in any rental place, but recently our library received a copy and so I snatched it up the second it was available.  Now I must say that I have not read the novel yet.  It's on my VERY LONG LIST of `must reads' but I just have yet to reach it.  After watching this film though I may have to reach that book a little quicker than anticipated.I guess the first thing I should say is that everything you've heard about this film is true, all the praise it received was well deserved and every second of it's running time is well worth it.  I was absorbed in this film from start to finish.`To Kill a Mockingbird' broaches the subject of racism in the South during the depression but it's overlaying message of equality and acceptance are what we should all be taking away from this masterpiece.  The film revolves around a count case involving a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the man selected to represent him.  The story is told through the eyes of Atticus' children, mostly his daughter Scout.  As Scout and her brother Jem battle their own quote-unquote prejudices with a neighborhood boy named Boo Radley they watch their father work to free a man he knows is innocent.  Atticus, a widower, works equally hard to instill good morals in his two children and raise them right and this is reflected in their ability to reason on situations, some even too big for them to fully understand.`To Kill a Mockingbird' has been labeled a classic, and you don't call them classics for nothing.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' truly is a downright perfect film.  The acting is superb, which is something I never truly expected.  I have watched a fair share of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.  Gregory Peck (who won the Oscar for this performance) comes across so natural, so organic here.  He reacts as a father would, with subtleties when necessary as well as force.  His performance is understandably tempered and it helps aid the message of the film along.The two young children as well, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are excellent here.  For young actors they grasped their characters exceptionally well.  Brock Peters is convincing as Tom Robinson, the black man on trial, and James Anderson is deliciously evil as Robert Ewell, the man accusing him of the crime (against his daughter).It was also interesting to see a young Robert Duvall here in a very small yet very powerful role.  He was truly commanding and played a key part in making this film's message a universal one.In the end I don't think there are enough good things to be said about `To Kill a Mockingbird'.  It's brilliantly scripted, acted and directed and stands the test of time, for while it was released in 1962 it still means something today, 45 years later.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' is a film that everyone should see in order to appreciate and one that I highly recommend to anyone with the slightest interest.  Don't wait any longer for `To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those rare films that is actually WORTH the wait!	5.0	A classic in every sense of the word; a film that still rings true today...	2007-11-06	0	0	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2J98KFY1SK21Y	Anthony	1962's To Kill A Mockingbird spreads its wings to great lengths with seamless effort in underlining the trials and tribulations of a society suffering from social prejudices. Its narrator, the overall-wearing, lovable tomboy Scout Finch (Mary Badham), describes the challenges she and her family face when her father decides to defend a black man charged with a serious crime.  Through her eyes, you see the clear divide that begins to grow in Maycomb County.Originally adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, director Robert Mulligan reveals his vision of the classic when the picture opens with a monologue from a seemingly grown-up Scout.  The introduction presents us with information on the somewhat artificial and judgmental Maycomb.  The frame is focused on an all-American, southern neighborhood where citizens open their homes to all, except for the Radleys.  Mystery constantly surrounds their dilapidated home as gossip and tall tales run high in the town; it does not help that the youngest of the family, Boo (Robert Duvall), constantly hides from the outside world in the security of his rundown haven.In the movie's beginnings, we are introduced to Scout, Jem, and Atticus Finch, a prominent family in the southern town.  Played by Gregory Peck, Atticus serves as the county's best defense lawyer.  Peck brilliantly portrays the classy, respectable single parent described in the Harper Lee original.  Atticus is a character that demands respect both on paper and on screen, and the multi-talented Peck delivers this attitude.  His calm demeanor and noble ways add to the character development in the film.Controversy surrounds the family when Atticus chooses to take the case of and defend Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), who Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox Paxton) claims assaulted her.  The tension between the word of a black person versus the word of a white person is depicted perfectly by Mulligan when the controversial case goes to court.  The small courthouse not equipped for many people is suddenly packed with eager onlookers.  When the case begins, Atticus asks Tom Robinson subtle, honest questions and receives truthful answers in return.  When Mayella takes the stand, however, her over dramatic shrieks and tearful sobs take away from the validity of her testimony as well as that of her emotions.  Nonetheless, it is well known throughout the movie that the jury still favors Mayella because of the color of her skin.  The verdict of the case has nothing to do with the facts being brought up by the prosecution and defense; the verdict is solely based on social injustices.Furthermore, under the black and white color pictures lie common events within a family that make the movie relatable to all; Atticus tries avidly to do the right thing, Jem strives to make his father proud, and most evidently, Scout endures the difficult process of becoming and understanding what it means to be a lady.  Not everything is as perfect and plain as it seems though.  The movie packs its share of tragedies; however, it remains inspirationally uplifting in the simplicity of its message.  Atticus's plans for the trial come to an unexpected halt, but his positive, sensible mind helps him come to terms with the outcomes of the whole debacle.All of the characters come to a climactic clash at the end of the film when Boo Radley makes an unanticipated appearance, Mayella's father Bob goes after the Finch children, and Jem breaks his arm.  The sensation from the film's conclusion fills audiences everywhere with content and motivates them to be as noble as Atticus Finch in their daily lives.  In this intense yet satisfying ending, we see the invariable nature of humans to disagree, but the positive consequences for those who rise above.	4.0	Mockingbird	2010-02-04	4	3	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	It's easy to think &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is older than it is. Released in 1962, the same year James Bond was immortalised in &quot;Dr. No,&quot; director Robert Mulligan chose to film in black &amp; white, despite Hollywood's rush to adopt the new Kodachrome II color film. Since the story is set in the 1930's, the classic look of the film adds weight to its historic reality.Adapted from Harper Lee's only book, which won a Pulitzer prize, the script itself won an academy award. Added to this is a stellar cast who manage to hold their own against the amazing performance given by, Gregory Peck, an actor at the peak of his abilities. For those who also enjoy Robert Duvall's huge body of work, it may be interesting to note this film as his first, in a non-speaking but pivotal role as Boo Radley.It would be easy to dismiss an old film that deals with the race issue in Alabama. Some might think this topic has been done to death and, to an extent, they are right. But To Kill a Mockingbird is not solely about racism. It deals with honesty, justice, fear, childhood, quick judgements and parenthood. Even the race card is dealt with fairly, without blowing things out to sensational proportions. It shows that minor, selfish decisions, which rely on the racism in others, can breed larger evils.An adult Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch narrates much of the story but it is her father, Atticus, around which the narrative hinges. Played with subtle dignity by Peck, Atticus is a small town Lawyer who agrees to defend Tom Robinson against charges of Rape. He agrees, in the full knowledge that many of his neighbours will hate him for defending a black man and still others will expect him to put up only a token effort. Instead, Atticus does what we know he will... his best.There is an interesting contrast between what we see of Atticus and how his two children describe him. Apparently he's too old to do anything, like play ball, and they are a bit embarrassed by his quite ways. The trial and its associated moral battles put their father squarely in the spotlight and not in a good way. He and they are attacked and ridiculed but in the end Scout and Jem see a different picture of their old Pop. A man who is strong enough to stand against hatred, and brave enough to highlight the weaknesses of flawed white girl against the strengths of an honest black man.The name of the film is taken from one of Attcus's rules relating to using a rifle. Jem relates his father's instruction &quot;to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird...Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncribs, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.&quot;There are several Mockingbirds in this movie; the misunderstood Boo Radley, Tom Robins and even Atticus. For me though, the film is defined when Reverend Sykes asks Scout to stand up in the court gallery, after a failed defence, saying &quot;Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passin.&quot;	5.0	A small town lesson for the whole world	2003-11-17	18	18	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	Harper Lee must have loved her Daddy and big brother.  Her warm fictional remembrance of them as Atticus and Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird is filled with respect and love.  She had a story to tell of race and hatred and tolerance and understanding, but underpinning all of it is her love of the two central males of her childhood, her kind and wise father, and her loving, protective brother.  This is the heart of her book, and it is the heart of this faithfully adapted film of that book.In an age that usually draws males and females in broad caricatures, depicting brutishness and carnality as the norm, and crassness and &quot;in-your-face&quot; as the only form of honesty, the characters in Mockingbird are not only refreshing, they are a revelation.The book and the film is largely about decency.  Simple human decency.  The characters in this story of childhood adventures, awakenings and surprises, with the trial of an innocent black man in the South of the 30's at its center, are by and large decent people.From Scout's father, Atticus, sincerely defending the man, to the Judge wanting a fair trial and result, to the defendant Tom and his family, to Cal the housekeeper, to the lady next door, to the Reverend, to the simple and plain but honest Sheriff, and even the farmer momentarily caught up in the lynch mob mentality....all are essentially decent people struggling within their society's preconceived assumptions and intolerances to do what's right. And, of course, there is Boo.Yes, the world has its share of ignorant, cowardly, and hate-filled Bob Ewells.  But, they do not define the world, so long as there are good men and women striving to do the right thing.This flawlessly cast movie is a masterpiece.  It captures the innocense and wonder of childhood, and the sometimes tragedy &amp; struggle of adulthood without preaching. The performances are first rate down to the smallest role.  Robert Mulligan manages to capture the world from a child's perspective without belaboring it.The world has spun around a few times since I saw this movie on it's release when I was little more than a child myself.  It captured and moved me then.  It moves me now.  It's simple truths and humanity are timeless.	5.0	Miss Jean Louise.....Mr. Arthur Radley...	2001-03-31	6	5	1

The lead character, Atticus, is brilliantly portrayed by Gregory Peck. It was interesting to see Robert Duvall as a young man who portrayed a lonely housebound person who really cared about the children who sometimes pestered him because he was different. The fact that children recognize injustice at an early age was evident. I think the themes of injustice,integrity, morality and taking the higher road are obvious in this movie. The cinematography was outstanding given the limitations at the time. This is a movie that is perfect for anyone, particularly families. The idea that Atticus was a hero in his children's eyes because he walked his talk was an important theme.	5.0	A true classic. I loved it.	2013-06-28	0	0	0

As soon as you say the title peoples eyes light up and they always say ""I LOVE THAT MOVIE!!"".  It's rare that a movie has such universal appeal that even my nephew who was seven at the time he saw it loved it and wanted to see it again.  I remember watching this when I was young.  It was so dark and there was such an air of seriousness (I was too young to realize everything happening in it) and the kids were literally so much like kids in my neighborhood accents and all.  The mystery of Boo Radley scared me silly but I couldn't help but watch it.  All I knew was that Gregory Peck was a dad that was too cool for words, who reluctantly shot a rabid dog in the street and who had a voice that would go right through you.  It left such an impression on me.  Especially Scout in the ham suit!Later when I actually knew what was happening in the movie.  I fell even deeper in love with this film. The relationship Scout and Jem had with their father was wondrous and moving.  There was such an air of admiration for Atticus from just about everyone.  Gregory Peck's performance as the widowed lawyer with 2 kids showed the strength, grace, dignity and vulnerability of Atticus Finch during the trial and aftermath of Tom Robinson the black man accused of rape.  Mary Badham's performance as the mischievous and willful tomboy named Scout who lovingly reminisces about her mother with her father is so pure and innocent.  She and her brother Jem's decision to make the town recluse come out of hiding is a fateful one that will forever change their lives.

I would read the book a couple more times to get even more out of it. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very very good. Gregory Peck is PERFECT as Atticus. As well as Scout and Jem being played by the perfect people. The film is extremely moving, and provides even more want to read the book and get into the whole story. Some of my favorite scenes include the trial, Scout's talks with Atticus, and of course Radley's appearance. The setting of the Novel is perfectly portrayed, and lets us understand the book even better. Even if you didn't like the book, I encourage that you watch the movie becuase it was excellent!!	5.0	Excellent!	2001-05-26	2	1	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A40ZMW3GWOB2O	Away2BlueRidge	My husband and I watch &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221; at least once a year, so in the interest of full disclosure, I am not reviewing a movie I just saw for the first time (even though I am responding to Amazon&#8217;s request that I review my most recent watching of it via Amazon Prime last week). This movie is the &#8220;Benchmark&#8221; for the definition of &#8220;Five Stars&#8221; in my book.  As some pundit once said, it is the &#8220;which&#8221; than which there is nothing &#8220;whicher.&#8221;  I need fingers and also toes of more than just me to count the number of times I have seen this movie since the first time I watched it when I was in fourth grade in the late 1960s, and my whole family sat riveted, huddled under wool blankets, on our unheated, glassed-in porch that doubled as a TV room in those days.  Even as a fourth-grader, I knew this movie would change my life after I saw it.  Many decades later, I can tell you that it still changes me every time I watch it. The movie bestows wisdom on so many issues, and you will find yourself noticing events in your own life that mirror those unforgettable teachings.  The character development in this film was unprecedented at the time it was made. And the plot was unprecedented for its time too.  In an era when little girls were being sold &#8220;Easy Bake Ovens&#8221; and there was no such thing as an &#8220;alternative family,&#8221; this movie&#8217;s protagonist is a tomboy (Scout) in a family headed by a man (Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer), and the children&#8217;s best friend is a delicate visiting neighbor modeled on Truman Capote.  I regret that almost all of the publicity about this movie has focused on the race relations aspect, only because it misses so much of what makes this movie great.  Admittedly, like everything about this movie, that aspect is groundbreaking, but it would be shortsighted to assume this is a movie &#8220;about race relations.&#8221;  The preponderance of the plot goes far beyond. &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221; is equally a movie about how to learn from misguided assumptions, about recognizing love, and about creative survival. I will stake my life and reputation that this is one of the best films ever made and that will ever be made.  Most films made now have &#8220;one note&#8221; themes.  &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221; covers far more ground.  In this movie, Scout&#8217;s learning about the impact of the Great Depression on human dignity is profound: her tempestuous interactions with an impoverished schoolmate whose father pays for his legal obligations to Atticus with bags full of nuts are tangible, and you can almost taste the syrup that her classmate pours over his eggs when he joins them for breakfast one day.  The scene where the children learn that their seemingly dull father is actually an accomplished sharp-shooter&#8212;when he kills with one shot a rabid dog threatening the town&#8212;is unforgettable. Most people who learn about this movie learn about the race relations story of the trial, and&#8212;as important as that is&#8212;it missed two thirds of the point of the movie&#8212;so I will end this review with a comment about the &#8220;Boo Radley&#8221; story overlaying the movie.  So as not to spoil the end of the movie for anyone who has not already seen it, let me just say that when the door swings back and it is revealed who &#8220;saved&#8221; Scout from being attacked, one realizes who the &#8220;the mockingbird&#8221; really is. No one will watch this movie and not feel changed by it.  Years after you watch it, you might hear the movie theme music and feel moved to tears.  Yes, it&#8217;s that good.	5.0	"This Movie Defines ""Five Stars"""	2013-05-04	1	1	0

Gregory Peck, won an Academy Award, for playing a sole parent, and he's never been better. The script for this movie was based upon Harper Lee's sensitive and intelligent novel set in racially-torn Alabama. Gregory Peck, plays Atticus Finch, a wise lawyer bravely raising his two kids Jem(Phillip Alford) and Scout(Mary Badham) in the hot-headed Southern town. The crux of the plot is Finch's defence of a colored man accused of rape. The film was put together by two excellent film-makers, producer Alan J.

I was just a teenager still in high school, but immediately loved the movie, which I  have seen countless times since. Gregory Peck is probably the single  greatest reason for the movie's smashing success, although the entire cast  does a terrific job in bringing this momentous story to the screen.  In  today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to how explosive,  provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape was in the early  1960s when the movie hit the screens. Yet despite the sizzling if subdued  sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the movie, it quickly  became the movie of the year, winning Peck the Oscar for his incredible  portrayal of rural southern lawyer Atticus Finch.No doubt it is the  character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's  enduring popularity. Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so  favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American  novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat  befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young  children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the  Depression. As daughter Scout remembers, there was little that Atticus  couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And, as played by Gregory Peck,  this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern  American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold. Of course,  the other characters are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described,  and the way in which the importance and relevance of the mockingbird  parable is sown into the web of the story at a number of different levels  with a number of different characters is also one of the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book.Whether considering Tom Robinson,  Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better  understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are  intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric  of a particular time and place. Indeed, we watch with growing affection as  Atticus increasingly relies and depends on their black governess, and are  amazed by the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well. On  the other hand, we watch as Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat people of  color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment of human  beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any particular  place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the characters  of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in &quot;To Kill A  Mockingbird&quot;, that one can only hope it continues to be widely seen  and appreciated as a modern American classic.	5.0	One Of The Best Dramas Ever Filmed!	2000-07-28	12	12	0

Not only is the message right on, but the prose is also really great.  Though some of the reviews on here said that the movie was so untrue to the book, I would have to disagree.  I watched the movie with my mother (my ten year old sister was too young for it) and cried and laughed and suffered through every emotion with Scout and the rest.

I can only add that it does contain perhaps the greatest single male performance in movie history.  Gregory Peck's character is so dynamic, upstanding, courageous and human, that he stands above virtually all other masculine roles, and provides us with a hero for the ages.  The story is about fighting racism and injustice in the South, and Peck plays a small town lawyer who risks life and liberty to save a framed black man from the gallows.  Other heroes of like stature come to mind, seeing this movie, including Martin Luther King, Abe Lincoln, Jesus, Gandhi, and select few others.  I do wish they would make more of this type of movie.

Obviously the main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and whit to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor `Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor house as it holds some mysterious crazed person. Through the movie many odd things happen such as a tree that mysteriously offers a series of objects from marbles to a watch, among other things. What do we really know about our neighbors?

Unlike a lot of folks, I didn't read this book in high school, but later in life in a period when I was reading many of the ""classics"". The book was excellent and the movie is true to the book in both story and nuance. The story is so well told from Scout's eyes. Gregory Peck, in the role of Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is outstanding -- in fact, I can't think of anything I would change about this movie.  Even the minimal (essentially non-speaking) portrayal of Arthur ""Boo"" Radley by a young Robert Duvall is special. What brings me to to tears in this movie is the amazing love that Scout and Gem share ... if you've ever grown up with an older brother or sister you will feel the same.

The ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" is highly recommended to all who love and respect Gregory Peck.3. To Kill a Mockingbird in either book and film form provides us true examples of the best and the worst tendencies of mankind.Atticus Finch for instant is what every Father should be and is the lawyer we would want defending us if we were in trouble.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ACC1SLND21RI6	Breyel	"WOW! What more can be said aboutTo Kill A Mockingbirdthat has not been said before. It is such an awesome film, thanks to author Harper Lee's remarkably ingenious novel. It is no small wonder she won the Pulitzer Prize for it and Gregory Peck held her in such high esteem. It was undoubtedly the piece de resistance in his long and chequered career.The plot in the film is true to Harper Lee's novel. An adult Scout (played by Mary Badham) narrates and reflects on the events which took place over two summers when she was young girl, growing up in the Deep South, during the Depression-era 1930's. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is her father, an attorney who has been appointed to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. Atticus confronts the racist father Bob Ewell (James Anderson) who has -- though we are not made immediately aware it -- beaten his daughter for befriending Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), the black man falsely charged of beating and raping her. In a parallel development, Scout, brother Jem (Phillip Alford) and friend Dell (John Megna) must learn to deal with their own fear and prejudice towards Boo Radley (Robert Duvall), the shy, gentle and mentally-challenged man who lives a few doors down from them in a derelict house. As the trial unfolds, Atticus reasons Tom Robinson is guilty only of pity and friendship towards a white woman, Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox). The Ewell's, who collectively represent a bigoted society that cannot tolerate racial integration, have merely claimed trial to cover their own social guilt or shame for associating with a black man, thus the jury falsely condemns Tom Robinson. Shortly thereafter, he dies under suspicious circumstances while being  transferred to a 'safe haven' in a neighbouring town. To avenge his humiliation in court, Bob Ewell attacks the Finch children. An unlikely guardian, Boo Radley, comes to their aid, killing Bob Ewell.So, where's the dead mockingbird? Well, Harper Lee's more subtle than that. To kill a mockingbird is actually a metaphor. The children, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are mockingbirds. They live their lives as innocently as the mockingbird. They mean no harm to anyone or anything, just as the mockingbird merely warbles his birdsong, never disturbing corncribs and such things.  Ultimately though, each character  is either physically or symbolically killed: Tom Robinson is an innocent man falsely convicted and killed; the innocence of the children is lost to the ugliness of racial strife, which nearly leads to their death at the hands of Bob Ewell; and Boo Radley who kills Bob Ewell should be tried for murder, but will not be arrested and charged because of his innocent nature and selfless act of defending the children. After all, to use the words spoken by Atticus earlier in the film, it would be ""a sin to kill a mockingbird"".Director Robert Mulligan  does a splendid job of impressing this innocence upon the viewer. At the beginning of the film, he zooms into Jem's cigar box of memorabilia which he collects over the course of the story, then pans the camera while Scout thumbs through the crayons, marbles, broken pocket watch and figurines. As she hums away like a hummingbird, Mulligan immediately creates a mood of innocence through the eyes of a child.  He carries on with the day-to-day simplicity of childhood in a sleepy Southern town, until half way through the film; then we begin to see this innocence slowly whittled away, much in the way Harper Lee does in her book.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch gives a reserved and dignified performance of his character, certainly deserving of his Academy Award. The children were naturals. Brock Peters (who passed away a few months ago) as Tom Robinson offers a plaintive and stirring performance. A young Robert Duvall, in his film debut, as the mute, gentle Boo Radley delivers a tremendous performance just with his eyes, facial expressions and body movement, saying more than some actors say in words, in a whole movie.I've also got to praise Universal Studios for getting this boxed DVD set right ""To Kill a Mockingbird (Legacy Series Edition)"". The 2005 release is a vast improvement over the 1998 version. On DVD 1, the film can be viewed with or without the director's comments. On DVD 1 and 2, there is a documentary on Gregory Peck, his family and friends, as well as archived clips dealing with ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". All are appropriately interspersed, adding genuine warmth and depth to the man who portrayed Atticus. Quite surprisingly, we discover the actor and character were in many ways one and the same person. Wait, this boxed set also comes with several postcards depicting various versions of the film's theatrical posters, which illustrate if anything how immensely popular the film was and remains to audiences around the world.In closing, I must say ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is at once an amazingly simple, yet profoundly universal story. Strip away its period setting of the 1930's; its occurrence in America's Deep South; and we realise the events could just as easily happen today, anywhere in the world, to anyone. Above all, it is a story that teaches the importance of fairness, justice, respect and love, for it is in these noble acts man learns to transcend his horrible propensity for prejudice, intolerance, ignorance and hatred."	5.0	"It would be a sin to miss ""To Kill A Mockingbird"""	2005-09-26	6	5	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1NPNGWBVD9AK3	"Bruce Kendall ""BEK"""	Everyone who has ever taken high school English classes will no doubt be familiar with Harper Lee's time honored story. As is mentioned in the accompanying DVD, Fearfull Symmetry, it is second only to the Bible in the hearts and minds of U.S. readers. This is probably also the most often-shown film in said classrooms. No need to reshash the story-line, then.This DVD set offers an excellent transfer of the famed black and white cinematography of the prolific Russel Harlan. It's a real treat to hear from so many of the people who were involved in the production, from the producer, Alan J. Pakula, to the now grown actors who played Scout and Jim. The audience gains great insights into what made this film so special, not only to the legions of its admiring fans, but to everyone involved in creating it. We learn the scenes that Horton Foote, the screenwriter added from the book to advance character development (the scene showing Atticus putting Scout to bed and her questioning Jim about their mother as Atticus overhears them from the porch, was not in the book, for instance). We get to hear from Elmer Bernstein talk about the genesis of his unforgettable soundtrack. Due credit is also given to Stephen Frankfurt, for his highly creative and original title design, which sets the tone so beatifully for the rest of the film.There is no question that this is director Robert Mulligan's greatest film, nor that in his portrayal of Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck found the role most perfectly suited to his character and rock-solid persona. This is a film about integrity, essentially, and there is not a false moment in the film. This compilation should be included in any film collector's library. I hope it continues to be shown in English classes until time immemorial. It's message and its relevance to the human condition will never go out of style, one hopes.  Major Praise to Universal Studios and to all those involved in assembling this perfect DVD special edition.BEK	5.0	Loving Treatment of A True American Classic	2003-03-11	259	239	20

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1U62ZQPJVCNUI	"burghtenor ""Rev. Richard R. Andre, C. S. P."""	The source of the movie is the Pulitzer Prize novel of the same name by Harper Lee, one of the most beloved works of literature.What is the film about?  Its themes cover a wide range -- race, parenting, morality, and justice.  However, all these issues can be summed up in one concept repeated over and over again:  seeing a situation from the perspective of another person.  Atticus says to his children that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, because all it does is sing.  Through Atticus, the children come to see the mockingbird in an unjustly persecuted black man as well as in the ghostly-white neighborhood bogeyman.  But in small ways, we see the mockingbird in a poor farm boy, a querulous spinster, even in a man involved in a lynching attempt and in a woman committing perjury.  (One criticism:  the movie does not have time to explore the surprisingly noble qualities of two of the least appealing characters in the novel, Mrs. Dubose and Mr. Raymond.)  Imagine how different our world would be if we treated everyone with the dignity afforded them by Atticus Finch.Alan Pakula gives every detail of his production exquisite attention.  The screenplay by Horton Foote deftly trims details and enhances other aspects of the novel without changing its spirit.  The score by Elmer Bernstein moves the heart, especially in the opening sequence that perfectly captures the playful wonder of a child.  The direction by Robert Mulligan brings out the very best in his actors.Cinema has rarely assembled such a talented cast.  After MOCKINGBIRD, Gregory Peck was defined by his portrayal of Atticus Finch, the widowed lawyer explaining the complicated issues of life to his two children, leading by impeccable example to do right no matter how difficult the circumstances.  Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are two of the best child actors ever.  Robert Duvall, in his Hollywood debut, gives a riveting performance as a shy recluse, even though he barely speaks.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD tells us that even in the confusing complexities of the real world, one can still persevere and make the world a better place.  This movie is cinema at its finest.	5.0	The best movie ever.  Period.	2003-08-31	6	6	0

I remembered it from my childhood and knew it would be a thought provoking movie that I could discuss moral delemas with my kids as well as look at a change in times from how we live vs. how others have lived. It displays the simple life where kids had to entertain themselves and use there imagination, which of course got them into trouble now and then. Of course the movie expressed the obvious racial problems of the day that no child today should take for granted. Other not so subtle issues involve domestic and alcohol abuse. In the real world we cannot protect our children from these things entirely but we can try to teach them to make the right decisions vs. the easy way out and this movie is but one introduction to such lessons.  Of course you have to have kids old enough but not too old to sit for a black and white movie.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	"To Kill a Mockingbird is certainly destined to be a classic of both American literature and American film-making, if it is not already. I would like to first discuss the novel from which the film was adapted. Then I will discuss the award winning film which can be obtained on DVD. Finally I will discuss the continued question about this work, which is whether it is a book for children or adults.Harper Lee's novel continues to stimulate debate. Whereas the debate was about morality and racial relationships when the novel was written, the debate of late is centered on whether Harper Lee wrote a book for adults written through the eyes of a child or whether her intention was to write a book for children/young adults. I know I read the book when I was in the eighth grade and found it to be wonderful.But maybe it was fantastic because I was 14 years old and the moral clarity and wise heroism of Atticus Finch seems very right to my adolescent sense of justice. The re-claiming of Bo Radley back into the world of the living also gives a message about rejection, acceptance, reclaiming the lost, and affection. The novel is full of wonderful experience and moral commentary as presented through the eyes of a 7 year old tom-boy, a technique Mark Twain used in many of his novels. Twain recommended this style in fact pointing out that the hypocracy and odd motives of adults can be commented upon through nieve eyes with a sense of wonder and delightful humor.The film, which captures poor rural Alabama perfectly, also was fantastic. Gegory Peck was outstanding, as were all the actors. The screen play is penetrating and tight, never letting the characters become cute country hicks. The black and white format with austere depression era sets compliments the actions, turning a residential street in a poor Alabama town into a microcosm of the world of good, bad, and misunderstood forces.But is it for children or adults?  Flannery O'Connor, the great writer, said that it amazed her that most adult readers didn't realize it was a children's book. This debate is re-introduced in the recent film ""Capote"" where a New York literary character asks Nelle Harper Lee at a cocktail party about the 'children's book' she had written and published. After a recent reviewing of the book and film, I find that the work actually has vast appeal to children, young adults, and adults. I don't mean this to be avoidance of answering the question, but the work has multiple levels of depth and moral instruction relevant to any age. The criticism that it is a children's book is usually based on the lack of moral ambiguity in the strong forceful wise character of Atticus Finch. However, he is surrounded by adults with quivering morality, including the county sherrif and a town full of persuadable white establishment. It may in fact be very realistic to portray a character with clear moral bearings such as Atticus Finch, since such persons do in fact live in reality and I have been lucky enough in my life to know many such fine persons and I personally aspire to such moral character and strength. I don't think this makes me childlike for I recognize character is long in developing,often tested, and always remains an unfinished work of art within us.  This is the appeal of the adult reader/viewer for this classic work of American literature and film-making for in the end it calls upon all of us, child or adult, to aspire to our own strength of character and courage for the sake of justice."	4.0	An American Classic book and film.	2006-08-29	6	4	2

The documentary, &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; produced in 1998 to be included on this DVD Collector's Edition, is great resource for teachers, students and all those who love and have been touched by &quot;Mockingbird.&quot;The 130 minute documentary, written and directed Charles Kiselyak, both discusses how the film was made and it's general literary elements.  The film is one of the most effectively edited documentaries I have seen, linking key scenes from &quot;Mockingbird&quot; with talking heads, still photos and black and white film taken in various localities across the south.The documentary narration, written by Charles Kiselyak and read with great emotion by Mary Williams, is literary and quite  sophisticated.The talking heads include: screenwriter Horton Foote, director Robert Mulligan, producer Allan J. Pakula and composer Elmer Bernstein.  Members of the cast appearing in the film: Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch), Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Collin Wilcox (Maybella Ewell), Brock Peters (Tom Robinson) and Robert Duvall (Boo Radley).Director Charles Kiselyak with the help of Harper Lee was able to get three residents to discuss their lives in Monroeville, Alabama.  A.B. Blass and Norman Barnett recall life in the small town during the depression, and Ida Gaillard, a retired high school teacher, brings an interesting perspective to what life was (may have been) like in the town Harper Lee used as the model for Maycomb.The literary and social significance of the &quot;Mockingbird&quot; are discussed by black attorney, Cleophis Thomas, Jr., and Claudia Durst Johnson, author of &quot;Threatening Boundries.&quot;In the DVD's printed supplement, Charles Kiselyak indicates that while Harper Lee was not willing to appear in the documentary, she was very helpful in the production.  She was thrilled with the director's plan to open the documentary with the first verse one of her favorite poems, William Blake's, &quot;Tyger:&quot;Tyger, Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immoral hand or eye, Could frame they fearful symmetry,Kiselyak's film discusses Lee's novel as both a way of life and a passage from innocence into experience and then back toward innocence -- &quot;Fearful Symmetry.&quot;&quot;Mockingbird&quot; and it's DVD documentary will touch your soul.	5.0	Exceptional extra feature documentary...	2001-03-26	145	134	11

For me, as a Canadian, this film has always embodied the best and worst of what exemplifies southern American culture. It deals with children, with racial issues, with the persistent matter of &quot;differentness&quot; that lies at the heart of every person's most significant issues. To be &quot;different&quot; is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live. And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom-seen, but everpresent Boo Radley. This is, in the truest sense, an American classic: affecting, powerful, and wonderfully faithful to the book.	5.0	An American Classic	2001-07-01	2	1	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  Gregory Peck offers what may be his definitive role (he won the Best-Actor Oscar for it after four fruitless nominations) and, perhaps, the most famous dad in film; as various critics have said, not even Peck himself was as good a father as Atticus Finch, but Atticus is probably what every dad wants to be.  Though slow in pace, the movie is never boring, and the picture it presents of the Deep South (Maycomb Co., Ala.) in the days before Martin Luther King is both fascinating and disturbing.  If, like me, you find yourself puzzled over why the Ewells faked a rape and accused Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) of the crime, your best bet is to read the book To Kill a Mockingbird, which also provides a lot of background about the Finches and their neighbors.  Robert Duvall, today one of our most respected actors, makes his first credited big-screen appearance (with never a word of dialogue) as ""Boo"" Radley, the mysterious and believed-insane neighbor of the Finches.

Although it leaves out what I consider some pretty pivotal points from the novel, it does well with what it can for lack of time and space (if it included everything from the novel it would be 4 hours long!)My only gripe is not about the film itself but about the listing. Amazon.com lists COLOR as a special feature format of this collectors edition.  I think it is excellent as a black/white film but thought it would be interesting to see it in color.  I was disappointed to find out that actually, viewing it in color is NOT an option at all.  I'm sure no one would mind if it wasn't in color but Amazon should not falsely tell people that color is a viewing option when it is not.This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 stars.	4.0	Excellent film but NOT color	2003-07-20	6	2	4
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3DSTOJPRMV674	"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent"""	"I suppose the death of Gregory Peck has left a great moment of sadness within us all. At least those of us lucky enough to have experienced the budding greatness of the 1962 film ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" There was a time, believe it or not, when director Robert Mulligan's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was considered trite and conventional.Many critics claimed Gregory Peck's Academy Award-winning honor for this film to be an acknowledgement of a long and fruitful career, rather than the individual performance. Unfortunately, this film was released during a time in American history when cultural change was on the horizon. The messages in this film, based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, were no longer considered relevant. They were lost in a sea of grainy TV footage showing Kennedy's assassination, the Vietnam war and Jimi Hendrix performing ""The Star Spangled Banner.""So I suppose it's not a surprise that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" fell through the cracks. What a joy to see this film's reputation grow on an annual basis. Is there a single American film in history more deserving of lofty status than ""To Kill A Mockingbird?"" I say completely, without a moment's hestitation, that Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch is one of the greatest single performances in cinema history. It ranks with George C. Scott's performance in ""Patton,"" Robert De Niro's in ""The Raging Bull"" and Marlon Brando's in ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""Rarely has a role fit an actor so comfortably and believably as that of Atticus Finch with Gregory Peck. The moment arrived, the cosmos came together, and Peck gave the ultimate performance of a lifetime. It was a role which would forever define a man, if not a country. Today, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is required viewing for all children. In fact, it should be required viewing for all Americans. This film ultimately personifies all that is strong and decent within our troubled culture.There are really no villains in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" but there are deeply flawed men, women and children struggling with the changing tide of a complex society. In ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" this is our world, for better or for worse. Gregory Peck/Atticus Finch will eventually serve as a beacon for us all. His portrayal is a testament. It is an example of what we can truly be if we tap the best within mankind. There is not a single bad note in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and a special note must be made for the heartbreaking performance of Brock Peters.I suppose it is telling that when watching this film as a child, I wanted to be like Atticus Finch - wrinkled white suit, gentle smile, respectful of tradition. One day, when my children watch this film, I have not a doubt they will feel the same way. This film, like the book, is exquistely timeless. And to think, it almost fell through the cracks of cultural upheaval."	5.0	Like great wine, this film improves with age.....	2003-06-20	2	2	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3AZ8GZA7ABIJ5	Christian &#34;Artimidor&#34; Strobl	"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own field. Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie - made with Lee's support and produced with the same love for the material - received eight nominations for the Academy Award. The film won three, including the Best Actor Award for Gregory Peck. Peck really epitomises the role of the Southern lawyer Atticus Finch who defends a black man accused of rape, convinced of his innocence. Finch has his two children to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause. What makes this movie so special is that the happenings are seen through the eyes of the children rather than the adults, and thus the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along. Yet while Atticus' fight against prejudices may seem to be doomed, hope never ends - and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this movie.The plot of the movie, told in a retrospective narration, is extraordinary and entirely in the spirit of the novel, evoking the full spectrum of emotions. There's also no doubt about it that the acting is outstanding, not only as far as Peck is concerned but also the child actors, especially Mary Badham, really impress. A lot of credit has to be given to the staff as they created the kind of environment to let the children blossom. Also the black and white cinematography fits perfectly to the story and several scenes in the movie will stay in your mind for a very long time. Personally I am thankful that I got to read the novel when I was still a teenager in school - it's an educational experience one shouldn't miss. Yet I only discovered the movie version decades later, and it didn't disappoint and I learned to love the material even more.Especially the bonus features in this special edition are enlightening and make the experience whole. They include:- A Feature Commentary with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula. A highly informative and yet entertaining commentary that stands high above comparable features.- Making of Documentary: Fearful Symmetry (90 min.) - Provides a lot of background information, not only how the movie was made but also what it meant back then and still means today. The film also sheds light on the time and locations the characters of the movie lived in by via first hand accounts of folk who experienced it all themselves.- A Conversation with Gregory Peck (97 min.) - A superb and touching documentary about Gregory Peck's life as an actor and father, especially dealing with the influence Harper Lee and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" had on it. Be assured, there's much more than just a few anecdotes to tell, and if you already like the actor, you will find this film heartwarming and love him afterwards. A must see and indispensable supplement to the movie. In this documentary Peck's achievements as an actor and his role as a father in real life stand side by side, the morality of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" resonating all the way through.- Academy Award Best Actor Acceptance Speech (1:30 min.)- American Film Institute Life Achievement Award (10 min.)- Excerpt from Academy Tribute to Gregory Peck (10 min.)- Scout Remembers (12 min.) - Mary Badham, back then child actress and one of the main characters in the movie, talks about how she became part of the movie and learned to appreciate Gregory Peck.- And finally: Production Notes, Details on Cast & Film makers and a Theatrical TrailerIn short: A brilliant movie, which made it on a DVD edition chock-full with extras leaving nothing to be desired. If you like classic movies and always wanted to know more about their background, this is the one to get for your collection. 5/5 - one of the best movies of the past century."	5.0	A Masterpiece about Childhood, Racism, Prejudices, Integrity and Love	2010-06-28	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1474D1L92U4OM	Christina	To Kill A Mockingbird was originally a novel written by Harper Lee.  The movie, while not as good as the book, was still very interesting.  The story takes place in the Southern United States at a time when racism was still a very common sight.  Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is a single parent and tries to raise his children, Jem and Scout, with the same good morals and values that he holds close.  Atticus ends up defending an African American who was wrongfully accused of rape by a white female.  The story is one in which all the characters are able to learn something new about themselves as well as life.  I found the entire movie to be very intersting and it held my attention the whole time.  I think we can all learn something from the experiences of the characters in the movie To Kill A Mockingbird.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AP0DQSDFSLP4P	"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M"""	"Author Harper Lee said she never thought of her Pultizer Prize novel to be more than a love story of a single father for his two children. It is that, but so much more. ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is also a simple social commentary on racism, wonderfully and innocently seen through a child's eyes, and man's rejection of others he doesn't understand. The commentary, 40 years old now, remains as relevant as then. As southern lawyer Atticus Finch, Peck garnered a Best Actor Oscar for his powerfully moving performance that, as one scene elicits, also commands a deep respect of the screen character. As defense counsel for an African-American (a contemporary poltically correct term; then, they were ""coloreds"") man falsely accused of raping a white woman (not popular in the south), Peck evokes a sense of outrage at the injustice of his client's position. The genius of the film, though, is its perspective of Peck's screen daughter, Scout. And it is her innocent confusion in not understanding why her father becomes chastised by the white community that hopefully gets across the sublimial message that there is no understanding of any form of discrimination. Ranked the 34th best film ever by the American Film Institute, this one will remain always relevant as long as injustice based on discrimination exists. The closing scene is gut-wrenching, but the film as a whole it is truly a moving experience."	5.0	Commentary that remains relevant	2002-11-22	16	14	2

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3DK5X66XYMTHO	"C. Hutton ""book maven"""	"This B/W film is simply one of the best movies ever made. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards, it and ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" dominated the 1962 Oscar race. Gregory Peck won his only Oscar for the role of Atticus Finch (which was his personal favorite movie). Watch his nine minute trial summation, done in one take, for a tour-de-force of acting.It is a complex film of family and race relationships with none of the epic qualities that won ""Lawrence of Arabia"" the best picture/director Oscars. But in terms of pure acting and story-telling (Horton Foote won the best screenplay Oscar for his superior adaption of Harper Lee's novel), the movie cannot be improved. Robert Duvall made his screen debut in his small but pivotal part of Boo Radley -- he dominates the screen without a single line of dialog. The film is worth repeated viewings for something new will be discovered.The two children portraying the Finch siblings also made their screen debut and Mary Badham lost the best supporting actress Oscar to Patty Duke, another child actress, for ""The Miracle Worker."" Her friendship with Mr. Peck and the antedotes of making the film is told in both Gary Fishgall's biography of Gregory Peck (2002) and the excellent documentary that accompanies this DVD Collector's Edition.The movie was banned in parts of the South during its original release for its sympathic portrait of black Americans. It is still a powerful movie that has not been dated with the passage of the years. Gregory Peck said that he would be forever remembered upon his death for the part of Atticus Finch and he was right -- all the obituaries lead with it in June, 2003."	5.0	Gregory Peck's Greatest Performance in a Great Family Movie	2004-10-30	11	9	2

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1V04WAUKCC0WH	Cinnamon Heart	"I must agree with a previous reviewer in which he/she stated that this film is dated and precious. It's a difficult film not only to watch but enjoy because the blacks in the film are all stereotypes of ""decent, hard-working, god-fearing Black Folk."" Calpurnia, the housekeeper in the Finch household, best represents the film's black stereotype. As a previous reviewer stated, she is the least outspoken black in all of film history and consequently the least interesting. The role is so offensive that this film is immediately disqualified from being shown to anyone under the age of 21.I too wondered about Atticus being at home when his children were performing in a school play after dark. Was his day at the office sooooo fatiguing that he couldn't drag himself off the couch to accompany his children to school? Yes, it's okay for a good dad to impart important life lessons over the breakfast and dinner tables but shouldn't a good dad be concerned about his children's physical safety?Why does Atticus let his 6 year old daughter run around the neighborhood - after dark? The Finches appear not to live in the best of neighborhoods: once, a mad dog is seen loping along the street and another time, a neighbor fires a gun at a ""prowler"" in his vegetable garden, (the prowler is actually one of the Finch kids.) And then there's a dark, spooky old house that harbors a hulking, reclusive man who - like the Finch children - sneaks around the neighborhood after dark. Once again I ask: why does Atticus let his 6 year old daughter run about their dangerous and questionable neighborhood after dark? In my opinion, Atticus is truly over-rated as the Good Dad.In the end, the entire film is just too precious as stated. It's the sort of film that appeals to those with very select tastes - like high school English teachers. This film is just the sort of fare I remember being bored with during my school days.You can safely pass on this one - but if you've dedicated your life to seeing every Gregory Peck film, or every film based on Pulitzer prize-winning novels, or every black and white film, you're duty-bound to take a look at it. The film is very dated and very precious - don't take it too seriously."	4.0	Don't Bother!	2004-12-03	71	2	69
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1LLFJHOE7DZV	"ClarityOfMind ""Harry Wentz"""	Of course, Gregory Peck will not disappoint you in this tale of a small town during the depression of the 1930's or the simple values of the townsfolk, how prejudice can outweigh justice or how help can come from the most unlikely sources. Lawyer Atticus (Peck) and his two children, Jem and Scout live in a poor town and learn the importance of family and kindness to others mean.  The trial is a travesty which caters to the racism of the period and captures the essence of an unjust world where the innocent suffer for the ignorance of others.  BUT, many scenes transcend that, and the final ten minutes will really surprise you.  An excellent production without any sex or language, but some aspects of real life during that period which include references in the courtroom to a rape and an obvious false testimony given under duress which could condemn a man to death or life in prison.

Middleton	"What can really be written about this wonderful film that hasn't already been said since its release on December 25th 1962?One can write that this has to be one of Gregory Peck's greatest performances portraying the memorable Atticus Finch with such believability that Peck attempted time and again to shed ""Atticus"" as an actor, even as an established one for twenty years, asking for ""villain"" roles and being turned down untilThe Boys From Brazil, Atticus Finch was a role made for Gregory Peck as the actor can play the sensitive, caring man of integrity with utter ease and did so for several films following To Kill a Mockingbird, such as ""Behold a Pale Horse"" (1964) ""Mirage"" (1965) and ""Arabesque"" (1966).Harper Lee's novel addresses many issues for its time including racism and entrenched prejudice against the black American in the deep south before and during The Great Depression and after...as an audience of the film, we are exposed to the necessity of pursuing virtue as human beings and what it really means and how important it is to have basic good manners in one's life; what it means to reach for and practice goodness and have core beliefs and in the end, standing firm by those beliefs against overwhelming opposition. The film also shows us the need to walk a mile in another person's shoes before making any judgements on them, or as Atticus says to Scout... ""Until you step inside their skin and walk around a little...""The magnificent performance of Mary Badham as the irrepressible Scout won her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress only to miss out to Patty Duke in her stunning role inThe Miracle WorkerConsidering both performances, Duke and Badham (both children) should have won a Joint Oscar as both were absolutely magnificent in their respective roles.When theMockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Leewas published, a somewhat recent bio of the author, Lee was asked about the character, Atticus Finch, and was he based on her actual attorney father, she said that Atticus of course was based on her father, but she embellished and added, creating a new character, a father and man she believed would be the ideal father & human being living under the circumstances presented in the novel.Despite this film opening forty years ago, the story and performances continue to be a model for present day filmmaking...beginning with a great story, a well adapted screenplay, a director who loves the project thus all in the crew give 100%, and the same basic example of virtue and integrity communicated in the novel and adapted for the screen: compassion, kindness, courage, respect and love.Truly one of the all time great films of the twentieth century...something to show the children, something to learn.A Bright 5 Stars."	5.0	What more can be said?	2007-05-26	5	4	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2IKPU8WUBCZV4	"""coffeelover71"""	This 1962 black and white film is based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.  Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his wonderful performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer in Alabama during the Depression.  Atticus is appointed to defend a black man who is accused of raping a white woman.  Many townspeople try to get Atticus to back out of the trial but his conscience won't let him.  Though Tom Robinson (the accused) is obviously innocent, the outcome of his trail is blatant proof of how prevalent prejudice is at that time.  Mr. Finch's conviction to defend Tom costs him some friendships but gains him respect among the black community and the admiration of his children.You just cannot go wrong with this movie.  It shows how kids adapt to very serious situations around them but manage to keep the innocence.  Gregory Peck should be a role model for us all.  He shows us to stand true to our convictions no matter how hard that may seem.  Winning the approval of others does not take the place of following what's in your heart.  I give him a standing ovation and 5 stars.	5.0	Southern Comfort	2003-09-07	10	9	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2RLGDH61TIKXO	Colin Thurlow	Harper Lee's classic novel on acceptance and intolerance was beautifully transformed into a classic film with a performance that placed Gregory Peck permanently in the film pantheon. Additionally the film has Horton Foote's observant script, Elmer Bernstein's finest score and a supporting cast (Brock Peters, Phiip Alford, as examples) all of whom mesh well.  There is, in addition, the glowing Mary Badham as Scout, really the central focus in both book and film, giving what became the performance of a lifetime. If there is anything amiss, it is that the always-excellent Kim Stanley is the uncredited narrator (Scout as a grown up). The film deserves its reputation and has endured the test of time.	5.0	Masterpiece into Masterpiece	2006-11-11	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2DB22MRLKXUT4	"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000"""	Let's get this out of the way first: To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film in many ways. It's based off one of the most revered novels of the 20th century, so it clearly has an interesting story and an important message. It's characters are fleshed out, it features unforgettable performances from Gregory Peck and Brock Peters, a most unexpected debut of Robert Duvall, and it's powerfully directed by Robert Mulligan. However, it suffers from the same problem that many movie adaptations do: it comes off as condensed, and therefore, not wholly satisfying. Because of this, Boo Radley's importance is underdeveloped, the court scene (no matter how riveting it is) seems abrupt, and it comes off like two well-done but thinly connected stories, one about the kids and their fascination with Boo Radley, and the other about Atticus and the Tom Robinson case. Thematically, they gel, but not as well as they do in the novel. Both are classics, but if one wants a more complete and accomplished work, seek out the novel.	4.0	A Disjointed Classic	2014-06-10	1	0	1

Also, Atticus' relationship with his children (played wonderfully by the two young actors in the film) is precious to see.  That said, I find the film too slow-moving for my taste. I am a big Gregory Peck fan, but the pacing of this gem cannot sustain my interest.  I've seen it a number of times (more recently, this evening, in fact)..and while some parts of the film cause me to stop what I'm doing and take notice, other parts do not.  In addition, the courtroom scene is too painful to watch..not because I am bored to tears, necessarily, but because I cannot stand hearing the testimony of the woman who claims to have been assaulted by an innocent black man.  I find her blatant lies unnerving to hear and her whole testimony highly irritating. Either the actress who plays her can't act, or she's so good it makes me want to clobber her, but I hate that scene.To me, the best part of the film is simply watching Gregory Peck and the two young actors who play his children..but as for the story itself..though moral and good, it seems rather disjointed and you wonder what's the point. Great film in what it tries to accomplish, but clumsy and convoluted (imo) in its execution.	3.0	A slow-moving classic...	2004-11-21	24	3	21

Reinders II ""CoffeeNut"""	"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is in my estimation, and many others, the single most important piece of work to ever come out of Hollywood. The movie covers much more than just racism. It's a tale of how judging others without knowledge is as dangerous and illiterate as a murderer. Unfortunately our society has embraced judging others, whether by media influence or just plain ignorance. It is a tale of growing up in a society that doesn't practice what it preaches (pun intended). It's the story of a man whose entire life boils down to the simplest of emotions, empathy.Why is it that a movie loved and universally praised can't be used as a blueprint for the society from which it came and today's society as well? Have we truly become so enamored of our own self-serving interests that we can't see what it's doing to our world.I don't know about anyone one else, but aside from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Atticus Finch, fictitious though he may be, is a personal role model for my life, and has been since I first read the book in third grade. I would give anything and everything I own to see the evolution of mankind take on the characteristics of Atticus Finch, Scout, Jem (and, Lord forgive me, no more of those whose main goal in life seems to be to make the whole world about them)."	5.0	Number 1 for so many reasons	2012-11-14	1	1	0

Released in 1962, this compelling black and white film is as relevant today as it was over 50 years ago. The beautiful story of a young girl's coming of age in the deep south skilfully entwined with the social issues of the 1930s that sadly still inflict us today: prejudice based on race/color; noncomformity with society and age. And of course, a brilliant performance by Gregory Peck in the role as Atticus Finch.

When I first played the DVD (Which was brand new), I was getting &#34;skipping over damaged area&#34; messages repeatedly.  I'm trying to make it work.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A17WGEUH86HDSK	Daniel Roman	Greg Peck received an Oscar for his performance over those in competition for this Gold Standard.  The only book written by Pulitzer Prize winning author, Harper Lee's telling of her story made its way to the big screen and set the standard for great performances.  A simple story about racial prejudice and based on the lies of those charging a black man (played brilliantly by Brock Peters) with raping a white woman (punishable by death) shows the extremes of a Jim Crow society set in the1930s.  This is one powerful DVD.  Watching this will more than entertain its viewers, it will enlighten them.

I am Black and I raised my children to be proud of being Black. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" serves as a good platform to discuss racism, friendship, & discrimination (both racial and special disabilities).  One of the DVD reviewers stated something about the topic of dated racism in the depression era - Well there is nothing ""dated"" about racism in the South or anywhere else.  Although much progress has been made, events in Jasper,Texas and New York in recent years serve as reminders that we have a long way to go and much to learn.  I'd recommend everyone to see this movie at least once, and to discuss at length."	5.0	Classic Novel - Classic Movie	2006-01-19	8	8	0

This is easily one of the 10 best American films ever made.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD does the impossible: makes a family film out of an unflinching look at racism and a rape trial.  That is, I suppose, what makes it so powerful: it walks the line behind the lazy summer days of Jem and Scout's childhood, and the hard truths of their father's courtroom drama.  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD brings back the joys and the pains of childhood more accurately than any film I've ever seen.Gregory Peck plays an unforgettable Atticus Finch, and all of the supporting players, including the children, are great.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1FDW1SPYKB354	David Von Pein	"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" premiered in U.S. theaters on Christmas Day 1962. Those who were lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen that December 25th came out of the theater with another Yuletide gift of sorts -- they had just watched one of the finest motion pictures ever produced (IMHO).There probably aren't enough glowing adjectives in the dictionary to describe the loveliness of this film. A truly fabulous piece of American cinema -- all the way through -- with a tender and bittersweet ending that always leaves one of those ""trying to hold it back"" lumps in the ol' throat.The cast is ideal, with each actor seemingly molded for each of their individual roles. There's ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), ""Jem"" (Phillip Alford), ""Dill"" (John Megna), ""Boo Radley"" (Robert Duvall), and ""Tom Robinson"" (Brock Peters).And ""Atticus Finch"" (Gregory Peck), one of the truly most memorable characters ever brought to the screen. And it's hard to think of how Mr. Peck's Academy Award-winning portrayal of that southern lawyer and father could have possibly been any better than we see it here. Peck always seems to have that ""controlled"" quality in his movie performances that are always a pleasure to watch. And never more so than as the low-key ""Atticus"" in this film. I doubt that it's possible to watch this movie and NOT admire the strength of character and unwillingness to stoop to such levels of vulgarity after Atticus is spat upon by ""Bob Ewell"". It's one of several scenes in the film that illustrates the type of man Atticus is, and the type of example he's setting for his young children. Some might be apt to call Atticus a coward in that scene. But they'd be wrong.This film offers up many highly-memorable moments indeed --- Atticus sitting in front of the jail reading by the light of his living-room stand lamp. .... The mystery of Jem's ripped pants. .... Boo Radley's spooky house. .... Atticus impressing his children when he shoots the rabid dog. .... That old hollowed-out tree that keeps filling itself up with all kinds of cool stuff. .... ""Stand up, your father's passing"". .... Plus, that beautiful and stirring Elmer Bernstein music score. Utter magic.There's also a good deal of humor residing in this screenplay. I always get a good healthy laugh when viewing the scene which has Dill drenching his dinner in syrup, to the shock and dismay of Scout (""Look, Atticus! He's gone and drown-ded his dinner in syrup and now he's pourin' it all over!""). A true LOL moment that's always good for at least two replays. :-)And possibly the most memorable quote comes at the end of the film, when Atticus says to Scout: ""Miss Jean Louise -- Mister Arthur Radley"". With these few words, Scout's fears of ""Boo"" vanish forever. The dignity with which Atticus ""introduces"" Arthur (""Boo"") to Scout is what makes this quote memorable for me.Universal Studios Home Video, on September 6, 2005, issued a beautiful-looking new Two-Disc DVD version of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", which comes with a bountiful helping of bonus supplements, as well as the very first ""enhanced"" (Anamorphic) Widescreen transfer of the film on DVD.Packaged under its ""Legacy Series"" banner, this 2-Disc Set sparkles in virtually all respects, especially the video quality of this iconic black-and-white film. It looks very nearly perfect to my eyes. Very few distracting artifacts can be observed during the running of this 130-minute main feature (which is presented in its intended 1.85:1 Widescreen framing here). And the nighttime scenes are rendered in fine fashion, with next to no video annoyances visible at all. The film passes the ""Freeze Frame"" test as well -- i.e.: you can ""pause""/""still"" an image on screen in virtual perfect clarity, without the image blurring at all, which I usually take as a pretty good sign that what I'm seeing is a darn-good transfer of the material to DVD.There's a choice of five separate audio options for the feature film on Disc 1 -- with one of the five being a Commentary Track with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula, which was recorded for the first DVD edition of ""TKAM"" in 1998. Tragically, Pakula was killed in a freak auto accident in November of 1998, not too long after he recorded the commentary track for the DVD. He was 70 years old.Other audio options for this two-disc edition include the original English Mono (in 2.0 Dolby Digital), a French 2.0 DD Mono track, and two newly-created multi-channel 5.1 Surround audio tracks (a Dolby Digital 5.1 plus a DTS 5.1). The DTS track isn't listed in the specs on the packaging, however. But it IS on here.Audio tracks cannot be changed ""on the fly"" (as the saying goes) while watching the movie (unfortunately). You must go to the ""Languages"" Sub-Menu to switch the audio. To switch to the Commentary Track, you must access the ""Bonus Features"" Menu on Disc 1. There's no ""Commentary"" option available from the ""Languages"" Menu (for some reason).Subtitle options: English, French, and Spanish. .... These subtitle choices are also ALL available when viewing any of the Bonus Features throughout this two-disc DVD set (including even the movie's trailer).A bonus item that was originally scheduled to be a part of this set, but was ultimately not included, is a replica of Gregory Peck's ""working script"" (with handwritten notes by Peck). That bonus was evidently replaced by the 11 ""Theatrical Poster Reproductions"" that are included here. These poster art copies are very nice, being re-printed on high-quality paperboard stock, which have a glossy look to them. Included are a few USA poster copies, plus several from foreign nations, like Argentina, Japan, Italy, Poland, among others. The artwork's country of origin is printed on the back of each of these reproduction prints. A well-done extra bonus, IMO. (Although I would have loved to have had Mr. Peck's working TKAM script too. But, oh well.)Also in the envelope with the 11 poster re-prints is a signed message from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" author Harper Lee.Let's have a look at the DVD Bonus Features.............Disc 1:> Gregory Peck's acceptance speech after he won the Oscar trophy as ""Best Actor 1962"" (the only Oscar statue he was ever to take home, amazingly enough). This vintage 1963 B&W; video clip runs for 1:28.> Excerpt from the ""Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck"", with Gregory's daughter Cecilia. This is a 10-minute bonus item.> ""American Film Institute Life Achievement Award"" presented to Gregory Peck. Run Time: 10 minutes.> ""Scout Remembers"", which is a 1999 NBC-TV interview with ""Scout"" herself (Mary Badham). This bonus runs 12 minutes. .... Mary Badham, for those who may not know it, is the sister of John Badham, who directed such motion pictures as ""WarGames"" (in 1983) and the enormously-popular and successful John Travolta film ""Saturday Night Fever"" (in 1977).> The Original Theatrical Trailer for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (Length: 2:53). The trailer is in Full Frame (1.33:1) format. Excellent sound quality too. Video quality is lacking a bit, but it's not too bad.> Production Notes. (Text screens only.)The only thing missing here are the ""Cast And Filmmaker"" bio text pieces that were included on the '98 disc. Too bad, too, because those biography notes were quite good (and extensive), and covered several of the various TKAM players and execs.Disc 2:There are two first-rate documentaries on the second disc of this set. These two extra DVD programs amount to 3 hours and 7 minutes of added ""Mockingbird"" entertainment, pretty much the equivalent of two entire additional movies.The Disc-Two programs are:> ""Fearful Symmetry: The Making Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'"" (90 minutes; B&W; Non-Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 24 Chapter Stops). .... This is the same feature-length, behind-the-scenes documentary that was also included on the earlier DVD release of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". Wonderful stuff here. Lots of interesting details about how this classic film got to the screen. Includes many on-camera comments by Gregory Peck. Produced in 1998.-- And: --> ""A Conversation With Gregory Peck"" (97 minutes; Color & B&W; Full Frame 1.33:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 18 Chapter Stops). .... This sensational movie-length documentary was produced by Gregory Peck's daughter (Cecilia) in 1999. It is a very nicely-constructed presentation, with a good music score too, which delves in great depth into the personal side of the great Gregory Peck, who proves here that he was still more than capable of holding an audience's undivided attention at age 83.This documentary could very easily have been called ""Gregory Peck's Life: In His Own Words"". It's quite literally a biography on the personal life and movie career of Mr. Peck. It's certainly one of the best ""bio"" pieces I've ever seen on the life of any actor.This ""docu-bio"" contains video clips of many of Peck's films, plus old home movies, several talk-show clips featuring Gregory, and lots of other interesting stuff that help to give even more insight into the life of this amazing American actor (who was born in California on April 5, 1916).Gregory Peck takes center stage during portions of the program (literally), as he talks and jokes with large audiences around the United States, and conducts various Q&A; sessions.There's lots of candid footage of Peck (and family) here too, including some impressive shots taken at Niagara Falls. And in Paris, too. And Ireland. And in Washington, D.C., as Gregory gets an award from then-President Bill Clinton.Near the end of this thoroughly-engaging bio/""Conversation"", we see proud granddaddy Gregory holding his just-born grandson (who was named ""Harper"", after TKAM author Harper Lee). The scenes of Little Harper will make you want to reach into your TV and scoop up this adorable munchkin. He's one of the cutest little tykes I've ever laid eyes on. It's no wonder Gregory looks so proud here. These tender scenes with Gregory and his new grandson add the perfect sweet and sentimental finishing touches to the whole documentary.This ""Conversation"" bonus is a genuinely unique program. It was produced with an obvious large dose of love and affection by Mr. Peck's daughter (and all others who were involved in putting it together). After viewing it, you can't help but feel like you know (and admire) a man named Eldred Gregory Peck quite a bit better than you did just ninety-seven minutes earlier. And that might be the best compliment I can pay this very special and heart-warming documentary.Mr. Peck passed away in June of 2003, four years after he filmed this program. He was 87. He will be missed forever by multiple generations of movie fans who loved his work in the cinema for many decades. His talent is one that we'll likely not run across again, until we reach heaven. But thank goodness for fabulous documentaries like this one, plus all of his cherished films as well, which enable fans to retouch the magic and greatness that will forever be associated with Mr. Gregory Peck.----------------The packaging for this ""Legacy Series"" edition has a very solid and collectible feel to it. It's a three-panel folding ""Digipak"" type of a case, which sports an attractive ""leathery"" texture on the outside of the case. Unfortunately, there's no outer slipcase box (sleeve) included here, which will probably displease some collectors who wish to display this set ""face out"". That'll pose a small problem, because the case always wants to ""spring"" back open (due to the lack of a restraining outer slipcase). An outer box would certainly have been useful, but even without one, this package stands out as a ""classy"" DVD item on the shelf.Additional Packaging Note -- This ""Mockingbird"" set is not packaged the same as ""The Sting"" (another Universal 2-Disc Legacy set). ""The Sting"", which is also worthy of a purchase IMO, comes in a two-panel ""book-like"" pack, which ""snaps"" firmly closed on the outside -- just like the ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" 2-Disc Limited-Edition DVD release, which came out in April 2001.For continuity sake, I would have preferred the ""Sting"" type of closeable Digipak for the TKAM release. The two sets would look better side-by-side if they'd been packed the same. But, no big deal really.Both the ""TKAM"" and ""Sting"" Legacy versions lack any Chapter List inserts or paper enclosures (which is a bit of a debit). However, if you own the previously-released single-disc DVD ""Collector's Edition"" of ""Mockingbird"", I'd recommend hanging on to the excellent multi-page fold-out insert that came with that disc. It can be used with this new DVD set as well. It has a complete Chapter Selection listing for both the movie and the ""Fearful Symmetry"" documentary, and the chapter breaks are in the exact same spots on this newer Legacy version, with the same chapter titles used as well (39 total Scenes/Chapters for the Main Feature). There are also some interesting Production Notes and photographs printed on that 1998 TKAM insert.Also -- Make sure to disregard the ""Color"" notation marked on the loose piece of paper on the back of the DVD case that lists this ""Legacy"" set's contents. The film is in B&W;, not color. That's obviously just a misprint.----------------A Final Glowing Blurb.......""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a masterpiece of personally-felt moods and memories. Who among us doesn't have at least one childhood memory that can be rekindled through the actions of Scout, Jem, or Dill? This is a motion picture you can watch again and again -- and each time take away something different when that incomparable final act fades to black (usually something that requires yet another hard swallow with which to combat that ever-present lump in the throat that this movie masterfully induces each and every time it's watched).Any DVD collection of great American motion pictures is unquestionably incomplete if ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" does not occupy a prominent position on the shelf reserved for such magnificent movie treasures."	5.0	"One Of The Greatest Films Ever To Reach The Screen! ...

Peck, in his Oscar-winning role, is Atticus Finch, a widowed Southern lawyer, who defends Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a black man, who was accused of raping a white woman in Alabama, in the 1930s. At home, he raises his son, Jem (Philip Alford), and his daughter, Scout (Mary Badham, Oscar-nominated), and teaches them about compassion and the evils of prejudice. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is the second best movie of 1962, next to ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and one of the best and most important movies of the 1960s.

Since then I have read the book a few more times and seen the movie probably another 50 times. In recent years many of the movie collections are combined with interviews with the original cast. One of my favorites is with Gregory Peck. Peck often said that the role of Atticus Finch was his very favorite role in his long career as an actor. Many will remember that when Brock Peters delivered the eulogy at Peck's funeral that he remembered Peck as a man who lived his life every day as Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck has always been one of my very favorite actors so this had great meaning for me to know that someone actually lead a principled life away from the stage.The characters in the book are all very realistic for any community, not just a southern community. Racism and prejudice made be bolder and more pronounced in the south but it can be found anywhere.The book is also an oustanding example of how to weave a story and interact the characters. The audience for the book is not limited to any particular age. I have enjoyed it throughout my life. The screenplay and the movie is also pure Americana.

Rarely has a great classic of literature been so perfectly cast and so perfectly transformed to screen.  Harper Lee's nostalgic look at life in 1930's Alabama is a lazy walk in yesteryear that somehow gets hold of you and has you on the edge of your seat.  I read the book and watch the movie at least once a year and I still love it.  The characterizations were perfectly done in the book and very well imitated in the movie.  Gregory Peck makes the perfect Atticus and you are amazed at how well the children played the parts.  You'll laugh as the children try to figure out how to get reclusive &quot;Boo&quot; Radley out of his house (leave a trail of lemon drops and he'll follow it, eating them) or get a message in to him (put a note on the end of a fishing pole).  Yet you find yourself crying when you realize how much he must have loved them and tried to protect them.  Interwoven in all this is the story of racial prejudice in the old south and it's effect on the children, their father and the town. It's a powerful story in a slow, summer-in-the-south kind of way.  Definitely a keeper!	5.0	A classic!	2003-01-21	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	Talk about the legacy of acting legend Gregory Peck.  This compelling actor played two of the most iconic characters in all of cinematic lore--Captain Ahaband Atticus Finch.  (And Peck played both roles in his own unique, creative style.)  With respect to Atticus Finch, Peck merely enhances an extraordinarily good film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based on Harper Lee's phenomenal and timelessnovel.  I've read the book and seen the movie, many times; experiencing both are extremely rewarding.  In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.For openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.  The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.  The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.  Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.  Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning	5.0	A Masterpiece of a Masterpiece	2010-03-03	2	2	0

No matter how many times I've seen it before, I will watch it again.Having been raised in the deep South, this movie eloquently captures a time during the Depression when people were poor, hungry, scared, and ignorant.  The character of Atticus Finch quietly parsed the poverty and ignorance of his town with educated intelligence and the soul of a good man ... as his children watched in amazement.The casting, acting, photography, and musical score bring Harper Lee's original story to life.  The black and white film is perfectly fitting.  Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus was his very best work.  I still watch him in awe.My grandmother watched this movie with me when I was a little girl.

There are hundreds of movies I don't want nor need on DVD. (I want most to have some special significance/FX or scenes you &quot;need&quot; to replay over and over i.e., Top Gun, Jurassic Park, Twister, Men in Black, Independence Day) Mostly and fantastic about this DVD; another complete version with Mr. Mulligan and Mr. Pakula doing a detailed commentary through the entire film. Put on headphones and it feels like you're in the middle of the two guys chatting about friends you all knew years ago! Very Cool (Not for a first or second time viewer)  I also enjoy how each talks about different characters, Jim Anderson (Bob Ewell), having had a real &quot;backwoods mentality&quot; problem with everyone in the movie, (being so true to his character.)  This never surprised me, but Phillip Alford (Jem) remembers the many &quot;physical&quot; takes that hurt when he and Bob Ewell tangle. How Anderson took his part WAY TOO SERIOUSLY!!!!  Also Phillip recounts the way Scout, (Mary Badham) bugs him through the entire movie about his lines.....funny to hear about all the trouble they had behind the scenes, but how much fun it was doing the film to begin with.

Schryer	To Kill a Mockingbird was an outstanding book which -- unlike some less fortunate books -- was made into an outstanding movie. Gregory Peck won an Academy Award for his superb performance as southern lawyer, Atticus Finch, who controversially defends a black man unjustly accused of molesting a white girl. Peck, a consistently fine actor, has frankly stated that this was his favorite role, and his performance is one of the most outstanding even given on film. Although Peck was clearly the star of this movie, the various other actors -- including those portraying his two children -- were also quite good and helped make this one of the greatest movies ever made.	5.0	Gregory Peck's favorite role	2012-03-05	0	0	0

Gregory Peck is superb here as the lawyer Atticus Finch, an everyman thrown into the role of a hero of sorts among his prejudiced community.  Another highlight is the young actors playing his children; their acting, particularly Mary Badham as Scout.  Her final scene with &quot;Boo&quot; made me cry, which didn't happen  even when I read the book.  This is child acting like Macaulay Culkin never succeeded in showing.  The film gives a tender but penetrating portrayal of the relationship between the widowed father and his children, of the children and the mysterious Boo, and of a community divided by hate.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3LEJ7UEJQDQNA	Eddy Oquendo	This wonderful adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel is a film of great dignity, a Norman Rockwell painting come to life. It effectively conveys the leisurely Southern summers and Tom Sawyerish feel of Lee's youth. Drawing parallels between the fears of children and adults, the movie shows us that we don't necessarily grow up when we reach adulthood. In the end, those of us who do mature find that there is often beauty on the other side of that mysterious door; and &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; shows us some of the possibilities.Relying on the acting talents of several children doesn't hamper the picture's effectiveness one bit. On the contrary, it's one of the film's surprising strengths. Mary Badham as &quot;Scout&quot; and Phillip Alford as &quot;Jem&quot; are utterly convincing as the children that many of us got to know in school. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his depiction of &quot;Atticus Finch&quot;; his role is portrayed with profound character, and gives one the impression of the highest integrity. Peck's closing argument to the jury is riveting, and is a stellar example of on-screen presense. There is inspiration and hope to be found here, a transcendence of time that few films can match.The collector's edition DVD is excellent. Besides providing lovers of this work with a clean, sharp video transfer, we are treated to a beautiful &quot;making of&quot; documentary and given a decent director's commentary. Also included are several &quot;standard&quot; amenities: production notes, cast and filmmakers, language options, and a theatrical trailer. The sound quality is rather wanting, but it does the job.

Suffice it to say, there is little need to indulge in any lengthy film synopsis other than to  say that this film represents one of but a handful of times when a film  truly captures the essence and warmth of the novel on which it is based.  Though I only saw this film once as a child, its memory stuck in my mind  for a long time, and when I heard that the film had been released on DVD, I  quickly purchased a copy.  My memories did not betray me, for this is just  as enchanting and moving a film as I remembered it to be.  Furthermore, the  DVD transfer is excellent.  The picture quality is sparkling and the sound  is crystal clear.  Plus, there is a good commentary track and very in-depth  cast and bio notes.  However, the best extra is the documentary  &quot;Fearful Symmetry.&quot;  Unlike most documentary nowadays, which tend  to focus on self-propaganda and promotion and special effects, this long  (practically feature-length!) documentary uses the film as a starting point  from which to discuss the background era in which the film is set; it  focuses on real people and real locales which find their parallel in the  movie.  In sort, this is quite a remarkable documentary and is, in my  opinion, the best one I've seen on any DVD by a long shot.So, you  already know how great this film is and how great Gregory Peck is in it.  This DVD does the film justice, and I applaud Universal for producing such  a high-quality DVD.  A 5 star effort all the way!	5.0	An American film classic	2000-07-12	14	14	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"Having just read Charles Shields' biography of Harper Lee, ""Mockingbird"", and re-read her classic (and only) novel for at least the third time, I was able recently to watch Robert Mulligan's 1962 classic film adaptation with fresh eyes, and the 2005 Legacy Series Edition DVD fortunately contains a pristine print transfer and a bundle of extras that make repeated viewings more than worthwhile. Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, ""Boo"", whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as ""Boo"" in an unexpected heroic act.Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as ""Boo"" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voiceover for the grown-up Scout ne&eacute; Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, ""Fearful Symmetry"", filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"", directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute. Providing revealing glimpses of the private man, it originally aired on PBS's ""American Masters"" series."	5.0	A Cinematic Masterwork About Human Fallibility in a World of Wearying Intolerance	2006-09-17	13	13	0

For having very little time on the screen I think Robert Duvall was amazing as Boo Radley, he was everything I ever pictured Boo to be without having so much as one line, he was absolutely terrific!

The movie (also the book) presents an important part of US history in a way that makes it &#34;easy&#34; to comprehend or understand for younger audiences. The movie is not violent but instead focuses on the legal aspects of racial segregation in the US and approaches them in an intelligent way.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent novel, and this is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent adaptation. Almost everything about this film is flawless. From the script and the acting, to the cinematography to the music, it deserves its status as a classic monumental film. There's no doubt that Gregory Peck reveals his timeless acting abilities as Atticus Finch. It's a stunning performance, and this performance alone will never become extinct in the legacies of motion pictures. Like the book, this film teaches a very important lesson on racism old and new. Some changes had been made, but I hope readers won't mind, since this IS a film adaptation.To Kill A Mockingbird stands on its own as a classic film. Mixed with dark humor and very fierce drama, this is a film that will never be lost in the shadows.Grade: A+	5.0	Classic Adaptation of a Classic Novel	2009-07-08	1	1	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2LO5XLG3G50PL	Eric Swanger	From the moment the film begins, with its stunning slow-motion opening and one of the best film scores I have ever heard, you know that this will be a film to remember for many years.  It is a coming of age story about children learning the ways of the adult world (both good and bad), and also learning about the honor and faith their father, lawyer Atticus Finch, has in the justice system, demonstrated by his villigent defense of his current client, a young black man wrongly accused of rape.  It's also a moral and humanitarian story about making an effort to dissuade misconceptions about race and &quot;family values.&quot;  Lastly, and in a smaller form, it is a film about redemption.  What you think you know about someone can change dramatically when they do something seemingly out of the ordinary...like saving your life.  Atticus Finch tells his daughter that &quot;you never know what a person is really like until you take a moment to step in their shoes for a little while.&quot;  It's pretty simple, but powerful stuff.What I think is really distinct about this film is that the children's characterizations are treated with such sensitivity.  It could become easy to treat the daily nuances of a child's imagination and naivite as something silly or unimportant.  Their characters are aided by fantastic performances by the young actors, Mary Badham and Philip Adford.  Gregory Peck gives one of the most memorable performances I can imagine.  His portrayal is understated and touching, eventually leading up to his character's fierce determination in the final courtroom scene, where he lays out the injustices that have plagued his client.  It's one of the finest courtroom scenes in American film history, encapsulating both the strength of what the justice system of America represents and also portraying the fervent racial tensions that were dividing the nation at the time of the film's release (1962).And it all works tremendously well.  Some of the most poignant moments in the film were so subtle.  The part where I lost it was when, after Finch was handed a defeat by the jurors, he slowly starts gathering up his paperwork as the courtroom floor empties.  But the second floor (of black townspeople-in awe of his defense) stand and watch as he gets ready to leave.  Reverend Sykes quietly tells Atticus' son Jem to stand up, in a way to hommage the man who stood up for his own beliefs and the defense of not just a single man accused, but a whole community.  It was a really sensitive visual statement that conveyed a powerful sentiment about the perpetual state of race in America.  And I was crying big-time!  And the final scene, in which we find out the true personality of Boo Radley, was really suprising and touching.  It really makes you think about the how extraordinary the human spirit can be, and how making snap judgements about other people really doesn't pay off in the end.I just saw the film for the first time tonight, and it is now one of my all time favorites.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3HA3HNQP3Z5F3	"father2 ""father2"""	"To Kill a Mockingbird is without doubt Gregory Peck's finest work. When the author of To Kill a Mockingbird first saw Gregory Peck she was not convinced that he was the man to play the central role of Atticus Finch, indeed she thought him too young. But when she first saw Gregory Peck playing Atticus she remarked that it was like seeing her beloved ""Daddy"". When you watch Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch, he is so natural in the role, that you sense that he was born to play this role.This film's screenplay adaptation of Harper Lee's book concentrates mainly on the courtroom scenes. But this film also considers other elements from the book too, including the relationship between the three children Scout, Jem and Dill with Boo Radley. Look out for the scene where the children decide to investigate the Radley home under the cover of darkness, the courtroom scene where Atticus appeals to the jury and the scene where Scout stops a murder intent mob in it's tracks. Though shot in black and white this does not rob the film of it's impact, indeed I felt the lack of colour gives the film a raw power all of its own. Furthermore, I guarantee that after watching this film you will want to read or indeed reread the book.Both Gregory Peck's father and Harper Lee's father had sadly died soon after the end of production. Before Gregory Peck went to the Oscar ceremony Harper Lee gave him her father's gold watch for luck. It worked! At the Oscar ceremony Gregory Peck at long last received his highly deserved Oscar. A fitting tribute to a man that many people have come to view as Atticus Finch himself."	5.0	Peck's Finest Work	2005-11-26	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A73DFWJE0CGY6	"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee"""	"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a powerful, hugely well-acted film that should be on everyone's Top Ten and should be in every film collection. The book took me for a ride as a child, one of those rare books we were made to read in school that I could not put down; the film, with exemplary performances by Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Brock Peters, is a searing treatise on social mores of the time and it still speaks to us today. We have not come all that far from the era portrayed in the film, and it should be shown in schools; it is that good.Scout (Mary Badham), a precocious child, runs pretty much unchecked through the small Southern town in which she is raised, tolerated by the townsfolk because her father is Atticus Finch, a well-respected attorney; and really, she is looked upon with affection by most, who feel sorry for her because her mother died. She only has time to ruminate on that occasionally, as she and her older brother Jem, and a visiting boy there for the summer, get into all sorts of adventures against the backdrop of her father's preparing to defend a local black man on trial for the alleged rape of a young white woman. There are those in town who can smell a frame clearly enough, but this is the South, and a charge brought by a white against a black is going to have dismally predictable results. Atticus, who knows his client is innocent, forges ahead anyway, facing down intimidation and threats to his children, and building up the film to a crescendo of an ending. The ending of the movie - and scattered references throughout the film - introduced us, also, to Robert Duvall, as he just began his film career; and though his part is small, it is wrenchingly powerful.The highest recommendation possible. Everyone should own this movie, in whatever form you can get it."	5.0	Top Ten classic	2008-08-27	2	1	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A8JMXJ7MJ71AS	"Foistie3 ""Foistie3"""	"A Reflection Of Our LivesThe following May 2006 review of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is an update to my prior January 2000 review of the same movie. This updated review refers to the superior ""Legacy Series Edition"" of the movie which is now the preferred DVD purchase choice. The ""Legacy Series Edition"" includes notably better sound options (Dolby Digital 5.1) than previous editions (such as the ""Collectors Edition"") as well as various `extras' now included in the ""Legacy"" two disc set. The `5.1 sound option' alone is worth upgrading to the ""Legacy Series Edition"" and many fans will appreciate the new `extras' included on the new version. Now, on to the movie (and the book)...""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a timeless classic, displayed in breathtaking imaginative and visual beauty whether you read the book or watch the movie. Either genre brings to life the old south, its charm, its bigotry, its prejudice, its fear of the unknown, and ultimately its triumph of the human soul.There is a beauty to both the movie and the book which seems to change as one grows older. The timelessness of the movie/book is evidenced on two different levels. Both are appreciated today as much as when they were originally released. Perhaps more importantly, children under the age of 10 identify with the book or movie as only a child can. As one grows older, you see the movie/book through the eyes of an adult and from a different perspective. A parent can also appreciate the movie, reliving it through their own children's eyes.The BOOK is essentially the 'coming of age' of Jem as he slowly leaves his childhood behind and begins to understand the harsh realities of life in the deep South. The MOVIE more represents the 'coming of age' of Scout as she views the black and white realities which slowly surround her. Scout's innocence reminds adults of their moral code and conduct in the movie, the book, and (surprisingly) in real life. She is able to center us on our own humanity as is witnessed in many scenes; chiefly in the (midnight) jail scene where she single handedly (and unknowingly) stops a lynching by simply saying `hello' to someone she recognizes in the lynch mob.Ultimately, I suppose, the movie represents our 'coming of age', as a child, as an adult, as individuals, and as a society. Each of us must decide whether we will take up the hangman's noose or drop the rope in favor of the child within.On a different level, Boo Radley represents all of these same fears, prejudices, and bigotry ingrained within America, North and South. Only when we finally meet Boo for the first time, do we recognize a human face, a protector, a neighbor, rather than the devil himself. Scout and Jem's journey is also our journey, one in which we all make. Some choose to see the fearful murderer who lives in the Radley house, while others choose to see the human being and ultimately reach out to say ""Hey Boo...""In this black and white book, in this black and white movie, in this black and white world, there will always be a Bob or Mayella Ewell. Fortunately, there will also be a Boo, an Atticus, a Tom, a Jem, or a Scout. Hopefully they will be there for each of us when we ""waked up in the morning..."""	5.0	A Reflection Of Our Lives	2006-05-10	0	0	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3V1AHX8P4R839	"Forrest Wildwood ""Phil"""	This movie is, safe to say, on just about everyones favorite movie listing.  Harper Lee's classic novel brought to life with Gregory Peck in the lead role of Atticus Finch.  I don't think Gregory Peck ever did a bad movie in his film career and he shines in this one.  As Atticus, he displays the kind of lawyer that you would want if you ever had to go to trial for anything.  He also displays a pretty good example to all us fathers on how to deal with our children.  There are some very good ideologies displayed in this movie.  The idea that all men are equal in the eyes of the court was displayed with Atticus defending a black man against a flimsy rape charge.  I'm not sure in 30's Alabama you could ever get a fair and impartial jury on this count.  This is a very satisfying movie that everyone, including your children, should watch.  The movie really hits home in alot of areas and is well worth adding to your movie library.	5.0	You Never Get to Know Someone Unless You Walk Around in Their Shoes..	2005-07-22	4	3	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	Adapted from the famous novel this film holds its own thanks to a stellar portrayal of Atticus Finch by Gregory Peck who embodied one of the most heroic screen personas because of his humility, his quiet strength, and his ability to understand others. Furthermore, this film covered the issue of prejudice when it was still a very explosive subject to many people. Adapted from Harper Lee's classic, this film has a lot of things going for it. This includes a touching story and on of the greatest heroes of all time. It follows the recollections of Scout (Mary Badham) as she remembers her childhood with her older brother Jem and their widowed, lawyer father Atticus. The plot revolves most importantly around the trial of a black man for an accused rape of a white girl. The only man willing to defend Tom Robinson is Atticus because he feels it is the right thing to do. In probably his greatest performance, Gregory Peck portrayed a quiet yet courageous man, Lee had likened to her father. Instantly we are drawn to this well-grounded person who is not always liked or successful for that matter, but who always does what is ultimately right.	5.0	To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)	2013-06-01	0	0	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	"To Kill a Mockingbird, as other reviewers have noted, is probably not only one of the significant novels of our time, but also one of the most important movies. It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time. It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place. Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book. Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision. The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.The film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end. In this case, Atticus Finch is the lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with rape, knowing full well that it isn't the popular decision in the Maycomb community, and that ultimately, he and his children will have to pay for it through insults, gossip and general Southern ""inhospitality"". Still, Atticus sticks to his guns, and doesn't let this get the best of him, a lesson that Jem and Scout learn as the film progresses. Gossiping neighbors whisper, not approving of what Atticus is doing. Atticus Finch has several conflicts with Bob Ewell, a trashy member of the community whose prejudice is evidenced when he spits on Atticus, calls him a derogatory term, and then seeks revenge later. As a result of Atticus' strong principles, Jem, his son, and Scout, his daughter, see the world through realistic viewpoints (albeit the ugliness of society's views on race becomes apparent). The children endure taunts from classmates and even relatives about their father defending Tom Robinson and, as the trail unfolds, the ugliness of class and racial injustice surfaces. Jem and Scout experience a coming of age; their innocent world view is contradicted by these unsettling events. The subplot of To Kill a Mockingbird concerns Boo Radley, a recluse who lives nearby, but has not been seen in years. Rumors swirl about Boo, usually involving something to do with his apparent ""craziness"", but there is no real proof, and Jem and Scout are left to their own imaginings. However, a significant event changes their perception of him and the world; they are able, as Atticus puts, see things from another person's perspective.This DVD is a wonderful tool also for any teacher who teaches the novel in high school, as the film is faithful to the book, including many essential scenes, so it is easy to read parts of the novel and then follow these with the film. Also included is a fantastic documentary which examines the making of the film, as well as interviews with several of the actors, such as Gregory Peck. All in all, this is one of the best films ever made, and a fantastic DVD to own."	5.0	A film that lives up to the book, and so much more	2010-06-17	1	0	1

I just saw the Spanish edition of this blu-ray, which I assume to be the same, digibook included. I guess Universal has released the same transfer everywhere, so this can apply to all blu-ray edtions of this wonderful movie. Even though Harper Lee's book is of course denser in detail and much richer, which always happens because books and movies are different media, I still think it is a fairly good, unpretentious, touching adaptation. I usually dislike kids in US movies, but these are truly an exception, they are just adorable. All actors are outstanding, and of course Gregory Peck's understating acting is truly exceptional. Not to mention the very brief, breathtaking appearence by Robert Duvall at the end of the movie. Elmer Berstein's score is a true classic, simply marvelous. The photography is also beautiful but...yes, the transfer is, once more, fairly disappointing. They have abused DNR once more and the result, although not as badly preposterous as, let's say, ""Sleepy Hollow"" or ""Out of Africa"", is still quite sad. Details are lost, borders appear blurry at times, and, most sadly of all, faces are rather waxy, very waxy at times. I just don't understand the obsession for getting rid of the celulloid grain, which was a natural part of movies for many decades; it was the way these wonderful movies were shot and watched in theaters for generations. Comparison with other black & white classics on blu-ray such as ""Night of the hunter"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" enhances all that is miserably lost in this one. A real shame. One would think that after the ""Gladiator"" affair, which had to be re-released with a new remastering toning donwn the DNR, this mistake would never be made again. But it does seem Universal is getting pretty good at spoiling wonderful movies. After watching the short documentary ""100 years of Universal: restoring the classics"" one feels really sorry that so much effort and care is spoiled at the very end with the absurd DNR obsession. They are even proud of removing the natural celulloid grain, and, gee, that is really upsettting!! Specially in the samples from this very movie, where you can see faces loosing detail and turning waxy as they show the restoration in process...One also fears the worst for future releases.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	Having read the book twice and now watching the film, it's nice to see that the film has actually done justice to the book in that it's successful in bringing out the actual message of innocence lost and about the difference between right and wrong, good and evil as seen from the point of view of 3 children and specifically the little girl Scout.  People tend to hate and seek to destroy that which they don't understand just because it scares them and the children learn at the end that the best way to overcome this fear is to face it head on and to seek to learn and understand rather than to judge and destroy.  At the end, this is what Scout does as she befriends the feared Boo who saves her brother's life.  We all naturally love to support the underdog and this film tells the story of Atticus fighting for justice and teaching his kids as he does so by his actions as well as his words.This dvd has an excellent documentary about the film as well as good interviews with the cast and crew as they look back at their experiences while making the film.  The picture quality is okay but not perfect and could do with another restoration job although the 2-channel mono sound quality is okay but a 5.1 surround option would have been much appreciated.  Overall, this is a well-crafted film with excellent acting and an excellent screenplay.Recommended.	4.0	Tender, Touching Tale about Innocence Lost!	2008-06-05	0	0	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1UYL5GIQ8YE77	Fred L. Houpt	"Perhaps somewhere in the very far future when African Americans and Caucasian Americans have finally learned to see each other as brothers and sisters and not a human of color, then looking back on this film will seem strange and wistful. Until that time, we can do no better than to sit down and read the book and then watch this perfect movie adaptation.There are other great books and movies that cover the depression years in America. ""Grapes of Wrath"" comes to mind. Harper Lee's book and this film focus not on the displaced as much as how one person can rise to the occasion, show a strong moral spine and true courage. It would have been too simple to say that the film was about prejudice. Coming to the screen as it did during the rising cauldron of the Civil Rights movement, this film was a perfect mirror for the haunting specter that refused to shed its shadow over the south. In the aftermath of the ruinous Civil War, southern states, especially the Carolina's which led the revolt, suffered very badly during and after the war. In some places poverty and destitution never left the land. What did people do to get by in the depression era? Did they fall back on old ways and use scapegoats to satisfy the blame game? Certainly and that is where the story here begins.The audience watching this film in 1962 was familiar with prejudice but rarely had it seen a white man treat an African American with respect and a resolute commitment to seeking justice. There are other sinister themes that rise to the surface. The implication of a daughter being beaten by a drunken father, the taboo of a white woman seducing a black man, the injustice done to a mentally handicapped man by shuttering him like a prisoner in his own home; these are all hot buttons that would have made an audience squirm and disquiet their comfort zones. Even more ugly was the false accusation of an honest man, a person that was expected to be found guilty even by his own peers simply because he was a visible minority; this was the deep south and prejudice was so widespread.The richness of the story gives depth and detail to the lives of Atticus Finch and his fiercely independent children as they explore their lives. With several subplots swirling around the main trial, the audience is given constant stimulation in vivid colors of human drama. Shot in black and white and blessed with a superb script, one of the greatest male actors in the English speaking world, a sublime musical score by Elmer Bernstein, two child actors who were so natural that they became Atticus's children in a real way.....this film is iconic in American cinema and for so many good reasons. Perhaps Gregory Peck's greatest role, this film is unforgettable and has taken on a tinge of greatness that is entirely worthy of its craft. If you must own one Peck film, this is the one. As the saying goes, they simply don't make them like this anymore; what a pity."	5.0	A masterpiece that resonates as strongly today as ever	2007-11-27	1	1	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2M33FZFD3LYMH	Fredric Pierce	"I don't really feel the need to review ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" The editorial review and the opinion of the American Film Institute should say enough about the superiority of this work. Every actor gives a flawless performance. Atticus Finch is Gregory Peck's finest roll and his performance lives up to character. All the children are simply amazing. One performance that seems to get virtually no attention in reviews is Collin Wilcox Paxton as Mayella Violet Ewell. Ms. Paxton draws together an astounding collection of emotions and releases them in one to the most intense and frightening performances I have seen in any film. I remember seeing the film as a pre-teen (when it was new), and Ms. Paxton's anguished, screaming face is the image that is most vividly burned in my memory. She scared the bejeezers out of me.There simply can be no reasonable rating less than 5 stars for this flawless classic. So I was curious to find out why some people would give it less!?! I scanned through all the reviews and found only a handful who, I feel, had legitimate reasons for giving 4 stars because they felt the DVD transfer was flawed.I was amazed to find other reasons. Several school kids who had been forced to watch (and read) ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" who thought it was boring. Perhaps this says something about our schools, no? And maybe it says more about television.Some people were upset because it was not in color. They were unable to get over their disappointment and see the movie as it is. It was made in black and white at a time when Technicolor ruled the screen. There is clearly a very specific artistic reason Robert Mulligan chose black and white. He made the right choice. The sense of the dusty, dry, poor depression era is beautifully reinforced by the black and white presentation.But the most amazing review was one person that said ""Racism still serves a purpose...""!! Wow! I guess there are still Bob Ewells among us!""Too Kill a Mockingbird"" is without doubt one of the finest examples of American filmmaking. Anybody (particularly any American) who can appreciate the finer things in life, and has any sensitivity to the complexities of human society, should watch this film. And it stands up well to repeat viewing, as does any truly classic work of great art."	5.0	Exquisite Filmmaking	2003-08-06	5	5	0

It is fitting that he lived just long enough to know of the honor bestowed on his character Atticus Finch, named Greatest Hero in film by the American Film Institute .  While mortal in life, he is immortal in film. So long, Greg!This DVD treats this classic film very well indeed, though some will always want for more extra features.  The picture is beautiful, the sound is good, the ""making-of"" retrospective is wonderful -- a must for your film library!  I'm not sure why they put colorized stills on the DVD box cover; it is a black and white film, but please don't let that stop you!I have always thought this film deserved a better place on AFI's list of top films than #34, such as the top 10. It is as fine a two-hour distillation of Harper Lee's great American novel as you could ever ask for -- a beautiful, elegant film that exactly captures the spirit and essence of time and place and character. Fabulous direction, photography, editing, writing, acting, and music come together seamlessly in a perfect, tight fabric. It is an astounding achievement in screenplay based on such a novel.  Of course the novel is far better, more complete, but it is a great film on its own merits.Harper Lee shows us the beauty and contradictions and ugliness in Southern culture as no one has before or since. She shows us her disappointment in and revulsion of aspects of her white Southern heritage, while at the same time showing us her great pride in a culture that is so rich and so beautiful when it throws off the ugly cloak of hatred and discrimination (take note, all ye ""proud"" wavers of the Confederate battle flag). Human arrogance and selfishness have wrought such evils, in this case from slavery to civil war to the desire for vengeance and scapegoats, often (and still) in the name of God. Let us learn from our history, improve ourselves, and sin no more.Buy this film, watch this film, love this film.  Be Atticus Finch!"	5.0	"""Miss Jean Louise, stand up.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AWGHENJ0HPG2G	Gerald M. Vrooman	"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was made long before the feminist war on men. Warren Farrell once wrote that we have gone from ""father knows best"" to ""daddies molest"". This movie belongs to the ""father knows best"" category. If the movie had been produced during the Clinton administration, it would have featured Sally Field as a fearless feminist attorney fighting  bigotry in a small southern town while single-handedly raising her two children after their drunken, abusive father had walked out on them. Boo Radley would have been institutionalized before he could get his perverted hands on Scout.Fortunately we are spared all that. Instead we have Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a widowed attorney who raises his children with kindness and compassion, aided by his black housekeeper Calpurnia. Atticus is given the job of defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. He braves the wrath of the town by giving the man an honest and competent defense and tries to get him acquitted. Meanwhile he defends his children by shooting a rabid dog (could Sally Field shoot a rabid dog?) and teaches them not to kill mockingbirds. In the end the unlikely hero of this movie turns out to be the strange and reclusive Boo Radley. If you are tired of movies that portray men as either morons, abusers, or gladiators, then this movie is for you."	5.0	A socially relevant movie men can watch without wincing.	2007-09-01	1	1	0

My son had to read the book for his English class and I thought I would also read it to see what it was about. No wonder this is a classic. I was surprised that a book written in the early 60's that was based on a story in the 1930's could still seem like something that just happened yesterday. The movie sticks to the book mainly with only a few little things taken out. Some people will write reviews and tell you the whole story, but this a story that you need to see for yourself. I really think people should read the book first and then enjoy the movie. According to the story, to kill a mockingbird is a sin. To go through life never experiencing this story, either by reading the book or watching the movie should also be considered a sin. This is a story that everyone should know and for anyone who has read the book or seen the movie, you need to share this with your family and friends.	5.0	What a great story	2013-01-06	1	1	0

Every once in a while, they can have an influence that goes beyond that. Then, there's Mockingbird.This is my all-time favorite movie (and novel) and the reason I went to law school. Second only to my parents, Mockingbird probably had more influence in shaping my thinking than anything else, before or since. After more than half a century, Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch still stands as a towering figure of decency, integrity and courage that we should all seek to emulate. Having first seen it at 10 years old, I don't know that anything could so encapsulate and convey the importance of empathy, as with Atticus' treatment of Tom Robinson and Boo Radley. Now more than ever, it seems we should all go back and watch it again for the first time. 'What would Atticus do?'	5.0	Required viewing	2012-11-06	0	0	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A6QMY5WPTVAT1	"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel"""	"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of the finest stories ever put on film; and the hero of that story, Atticus Finch (who is played by the incomparable Gregory Peck), has to be one of the most admirable characters ever portrayed on the silver screen.  If I could give this move more than five stars, I would.  But, since I can only give it five stars, I'll have to be content with that.  But please note that my five-star rating is for the movie itself, not for the special features included on this disc, which I found to be something of a letdown, in all honesty.  (More on this later.)  But the movie itself deserves the highest rating I can give it.  It is a cinematic masterpiece that everyone ought to see.In 1960, Harper Lee (a childhood friend of celebrated writer Truman Capote), published her only novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", which was based loosely on her own childhood memories of growing up in the small, sleepy, Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, during the Great Depression.  Lee maintains that the novel is not autobiographical, since many of the events it depicts are fictional; but the setting and characters are based on the places and people she knew as a child.  The narrator, Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, is based on Harper Lee herself.  Scout's devoted father, the respected local attorney, Atticus Finch, is based on Lee's own father, who was a lawyer.  And Dill Harris, the boy who spent his summers living at his aunt's house next door to the Finches, is based on Truman Capote.  Even the reclusive Radley family, who rarely ventured outside of their spooky, boarded-up house down the street from the Finches, is based on an actual family who lived near the Lees.  They, too, had a mysterious son they kept hidden from view because they were ashamed of him, just like Boo Radley in the novel.  In fact, most of the characters in the novel were based, at least loosely, on real people Harper Lee knew as a child.  Perhaps that's part of the reason why this story feels so real.  The portrait that Lee paints of life in the Depression-era Deep South is not only realistic, but vivid and nuanced.  She is able to honestly portray the hardships of poverty and the evils of racism that she witnessed as a child without ever crossing the line into caricature, and without in any way undermining her nostalgic portrayal of the magical innocence of childhood.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" became a runaway bestseller, and ended up winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  And, even though the plot of the novel was not obviously well-suited to be adapted for the silver screen, it was made into a major motion picture the following year, with one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Gregory Peck, as its star.  The movie wasn't able to depict everything that happened in the book, of course.  (No movie ever can.)  But we are fortunate that the talented screenwriter, Horton Foote, was able to find the essence of the story in Harper Lee's novel and turn it into a brilliant screenplay.  What we end up with is a film that doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood movie.  Instead, it feels more like an actual look at someone's bittersweet memories of childhood.I'm no literary critic; so I won't even attempt to plumb the depths of this story.  It's far too rich for even a cursory exploration of its many themes in a review such as this.  But I do want to comment very briefly on what I believe to be the single greatest thing about this story: the character of Atticus Finch.  There are few people I can think of -- either in the real world or in works of fiction -- who are even remotely as admirable as Atticus Finch.  I find it hard to even imagine a better role model for a young person (especially a young man) to emulate.  He represents, at least in my view, the ideal father, the ideal lawyer, the ideal citizen, the ideal gentleman, and perhaps even the ideal human being.  As a father, he sets a good example for his children, treats them with respect and kindness, nurtures them, allows them a measure of independence, encourages their curiosity, answers their questions as honestly as he can, tries his best to instill in them the right values, and gently explains things to them rather than lecturing them or yelling at them.  As a lawyer, he has the highest possible standards of ethics and integrity, genuine compassion for his clients, a non-cynical respect for the law, and a commitment to justice.  As a citizen, he is dutiful, respectful, trustworthy, hospitable, neighborly, tolerant, and unbigoted.  As a gentleman, he is humble, peaceable, dignified, self-controlled, stalwart, courageous, and polite.  And, as a human being, he is virtuous, kind, empathetic, hopeful, and wise.  I wish I were even half the man that Atticus Finch is.  The world would be a much better place if it had more Atticus Finches in it.This is a movie that everyone ought to watch.  Not only is it a good story, with wonderful characters and a fascinating setting; but it also has some great lessons to teach about life, and about what it means to be a decent, honorable person.  Everyone needs to be exposed to the example of Atticus Finch, who is one of the noblest heroes ever portrayed on film.  I can't praise this movie highly enough; nor can my words do justice to it.  You've simply got to see it for yourself.Unfortunately, my five-star review has to come with this caveat:  While the movie itself is great, the special features on this disc are, at least in my view, underwhelming at best.  The documentary ""Fearful Symmetry"", which tells the story of the real-life people and places behind the novel, and how the novel was turned into a movie, is pretty interesting. And, being a total geek, I actually enjoyed the mini documentary on film restoration that was included on this disc, which showed how various old movies, including ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", have been restored for digital release on DVD and Blu-ray.  But the other special features didn't really appeal to me all that much.  I think that Gregory Peck was a brilliant actor and an admirable human being; but the Gregory Peck hagiography on this disc simply went too far, in my opinion.  The special features included with this motion picture should have been about the movie itself, or about Harper Lee's story, rather than about the star of the film.  But four of the nine special features on this disc were about the life and career of Gregory Peck, and a fifth (an interview with Mary Badham, who played Scout in the movie) spent more time talking about what a great person Gregory Peck was than about anything else.  For starters, there was a feature-length documentary that Peck's daughter co-produced, chronicling her father's reminiscences during his later years when he went on tour holding Q&A; sessions before live audiences, which I might have enjoyed had it been edited down to a more reasonable length of half-an-hour or so, but which was simply exhausting at its actual running time of 97 minutes.  In addition to this there were two very short clips showing Gregory Peck giving acceptance speeches, first for his Best Actor Oscar for his performance in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", and second for his Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.  He didn't really have much to say on either occasion; so I'm not sure why these were included.  But what really puzzled me was the inclusion of a poor-quality, amateur video recording of Peck's daughter speaking at a ceremony honoring her late father after his death.  I found these special features a bit disappointing.  But they can't take away from the overall quality of the movie.  I seriously doubt that anyone bases their decision about whether or not to buy a movie on the quality of the special features included on the disc.  Even if there were no special features on this disc at all, the movie would still be worth buying; and I highly recommend it."	5.0	One of the best movies ever made -- everyone needs to see it	2012-09-20	0	0	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3CHSGA6EYQBUU	Gregory Zeigerson	"The movie To Kill A Mockingbird, like the book, transports one to an ideal childhood with a perfect parent. I loved the experience of entering that ideal family's world, especially the vivid atmosphere of the children's daily life in their town and era, and the subtle ways the children are led to discover the truth about some of their mysterious neighbors.At the end the way the viewer, through the children's eyes, himself discovers such a truth and experiences with them a moment of revelation--the sort of unforgettably meaningful moment that is a milestone in the road to growing up--drives home the theme: it is wrong to pre-judge, it is just to defend the innocent ""mockingbirds"" of the human race. The bending of rules at the end to protect one such mockingbird is utterly right and is justice; finally, a good, even heroic, act is rewarded.It is to me a nearly perfect film adaptation, capturing the book's mood and spirit and meaning exactly. I only wish that the movie could have been a 1962 miniseries (there were none then) so it could have had every scene from the book. I never wanted the book to end.My one small complaint about the film is that the courtroom scenes are presented a bit too much like a filmed stage play or a TV drama of the time, not as vividly realistic in its direction as the rest of the film. The actors playing the Ewells are also not up to the level of the other actors, reducing the quality and believability of the courtroom scenes."	5.0	About Childhood and Justice	2005-02-23	3	3	0

My teacher then gave us the choice to watch To Kill a Mockingbird or All Quiet on the Western Front (another classic we read prior to To Kill...) for our final.  And lucky me, I'm in a class with students who not only voted for To Kill... but they didn't even watch it.  But that's beside the point.  To Kill... seemed to have no plot whatsoever.  Not only that but it was not fun to watch/read.  The little conflicts Scout and Jem find themselves in are outrageously dumb.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3MEHHL9LNKW4Z	Herb Reeves	"Why ban them? Then, we might be spared what is possibly the most infantile, ignorant and uninformed collection of negative reviews present on Amazon.I originally intended to post a review a few weeks ago after I had viewed it on cable, but for some reason I decided to read the negative views first(both book and movie) to see why or how anyone could condemn either. It became a laugh or cry situation. I opted for forced laughter.A few examples of the absurd negative comments follow (with my own comments in parenthesis):""Every copy of this book should be burned and never allowed to be read again."" (Ah, the sweet smell of scorched paper around the bonfires. Armbands optional?)""Yuk! Try to avoid reading this book as much as possible. . . . [I]t is confusing . . . and there is too much information given at one time."" (You had me at ""Yuk!"")""Thanks to all my friendswho had to tourchure threw reading this disgrace and supporting me in not likeing the book. By the way, DO NOT BUY, because if i find it in your house i won't think to kindly of you."" (I tremble in terror and weep in shame at what you would think of my bookshelves.)""Talk about a bad movie i would only buy it if someone paid me twice it's value to."" (I don't think this is what was meant by the ""new math."")And, my favorite: ""Do not watch, do not read ... stay ignorant of Harper Lee."" (I suspect, young reader, that you have succeeded far beyond Harper Lee.)Sorry to review the reviews, but now I actually have something serious to say about the movie and book.Years before the publication of Harper Lee's novel, there was a trial in a small southern Mississippi town in 1945. A black man named Willie McGee was accused of the rape of a white woman. The circumstantial evidence pointed strongly to the possibility that the relationship was forced by the woman. Just as in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" such a relationship at the time could not - would not - be tolerated. The case attracted national attention at the time, and after a prolonged series of appeals (spearheaded by former New York Congresswoman, Bella Abzug), a public execution was staged, which was no more than a legally sanctioned lynching. The state's portable electric chair was installed in the courthouse, which was filled to standing room only. Outside spectators climbed trees to gain a look at the execution through the opened windows. (A white Mississippi attorney, Dixon Pyles, also took part in the defense, so Atticus Finch is not without a foundation in fact.)The Scottsboro trials have been cited as the main inspiration for Lee's novel, but I've often wondered if the McGee trial might not also have played a role. But it really doesn't matter. Fiction is often more suited to tell the truth than history. And the truth is that although many people in the South knew Jim Crow laws and lynchings were wrong, they also knew that if you were vocal about it, you could lose your job - or your life, which is what makes the portrait of Atticus Finch a true profile in courage, a Southern Gothic version of Sir Thomas Moore in ""A Man For All Seasons.""But beyond the racial themes, both the book and the movie weave a gentle tapestry of what life in the South was like before air-conditioning, where games were things to be played outdoors rather than in front of computers, a discarded tire was an endlessly renewable resource for entertainment and summers seemed to last forever.  (I've lived what I'm talking about.)What saddens me about the negative reviews such as I quoted above is not their ignorance, but the lack of curiosity they display about our nation's history. I do, however, hope that the young reviewer who urged the burning of all copies of the book is oblivious of the historical events he or she evoked and will someday realize the horror of what such comments endorse.Ten stars if I could."	5.0	Ban both book and movie from all schools	2007-06-16	9	8	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	"The racism `s argument monopolized the whole attention, specially in the Sixties. To be fair, we should take a glimpse around several essential films in the recent past which depicted with notable crudeness this sensible theme; among the most important we should name Defiant ones and The edge of city in the Fifties.But undoubtedly, the four most important thematic cycles  had reached its task in the movie industry: The Noir Film, The Science Fiction, The War memories and the lightweight comedies (Wilder, Hawks); an important and relatively recent current had born in the world: The French New Wave and the strong transcendence of the Italian Neo Realism permeated the vision of most of screen writers obligating them to make a true inward gaze in the deepest regions of the American social body. If there would be another weight reason to confirm this statement, examine carefully the work of Alfred Hitchcock from ""To catch a thief"" until ""Marnie"". You may realize how every one of the included pictures included these two concern about a dislocated state of mind, and the suspense is generated in the hidden caverns of the unconscious.In this sense this film had to shock the conscience of many viewers at that moment, when a small town layer assumes the hazardous task to defend a black man accused of rape. The allusive metaphors to nocturnal and spectral visions are eloquent testimonies of the tenseness at the verge of the boiling point.The bitter taste you experience even several elapsed weeks and months don 't leave any shadow of doubt about the grandness of this bold film that inspired future films in that decade, such as Patch of Blue, To Sir with love, Guess who is coming to dinner, In the heat of the night (it' s not a mere casualty all of them starred by Poitier) and nourished the inspired of another independent filmmakers such as Samuel Fuller with two somber and terrible films (Shock corridor and The naked kiss). Of course, there would be a striking picture as ""The chase"", but this speech would be out of context.Go for this little gem that portraits the thundering reality of the early Sixties."	5.0	A leisured drama!	2006-01-06	1	1	0

Gregory Peck's remarkable portrayal personified all those characteristics in a way that we are not likely to ever witness again.The scene in the courtroom after Atticus' closing arguments when the 'balcony people' all rise and Scout is told to stand because 'You're father is passing', will never fail to move me to tears.Every moment of this film is executed with complete integrity and every actor, most remarkably the children, is to be commended. This has to be seen to be believed. Without ever being preachy, all parties involved have made one of the most outstanding arguments ever committed to celluloid against racial hatred and prejudice. It is easy to see why so many attorneys will tell you that this film made them take up law.I am writing this on the day of Gregory Peck's passing and I want to send a heartfelt 'Thank You', out to the universe or heaven as the case may be, to the man who cared enough to give such a perfect rendition of all that is good that it was deservedly ranked as number one on AFI's list of 'The Top 50 Most Heroic' screen characters.

When I saw the film, I was first impressed on how up to date the production was. It is difficult to realize that it's 50 years old. I was, of course, impressed with both the directing and acting. There is a sensitivity that underscores everything. Many many reactions are subtle. The pace is always moving, Camera angles portray strengths and weaknesses. I loved it all.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	It started with the gift of Harper Lee's magical book, a gift to literature., indeed. Then came the movie, a gift to cinema that withstands the test of time.Just look at the opening credits, quite possibly one of the most ingenious and modern looking segments in cinema over the last forty years. It's simplicity absolutely captures the film, while setting the magical mystery on its course, the world of children in a box.Then move on to Gregory Peck's most moving, strong, amazing performance; it's quite possibly the perfect match with role, actor, screenplay. His dignity shines through a dignified role.And then there are the kids, two unknowns, who do their best acting by just being themselves. Mary Badham is absolutely charming and stunning in her innocent portrayal of a terribly difficult role.But what shines most is the story... the story of a black man unjustly accused of a hideous act, the story of a spooky man who lives a life of hiding, ultimately, how we judge others is how we are judged.And that is the lasting gift of this movie, and this DVD.Note: the bonus documentary on the DVD is amazing, long, and very informative, worth all of your time.	5.0	Amazing Classic	2002-01-10	18	18	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A366S12KCZ280V	"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover"""	My all time favorite movie. A true classic. Great cast lead by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch who won the oscar for best actor. I have lost count how mant times I have seen this movie but it is for sure the one movie I have seen the most. I was about 10 maybe when I first saw it. As a kid I was fasinated by thr three kids in the movie (Jem,Scout and Dill) who in turn was always fascinated in trying to get a look at Boo Radley, the towns notorious crazy man. As I grew older and became more aware of the civil rights movement and racial prejudice the part of the movie involving Tom Robinson, a black man accused of beating and raping a white girl, became of main interest to me. Atticus does a wonderful job of showing Tom could not have committed what he is accused of. He does this all the while knowing that the jury will find his client guilty because of the color of his clients skin. My favorite scene in the movie is when Gregory Peck gives the closing argument to the jury. A great speech which I feel shows Gregory Peck at his absolute best as an actor. There are many other outstanding scenes in the movie. Too many to mention. You just got to take the time to watch this if the chance ever arrives. It is a movie with no car chases or gun play or bloody fights or big budget special effects. To Kill A Mockingbird just relies on human emotion and the power of the spoken word. Give it a chance however and I think you will get caught up in this movie.	5.0	My All Time Favorite	2011-12-06	1	1	0

Racism is SO STUPID!! I am white; my family, my ancestors grew up in Jacksonville...most of them were racist.  But for some reason, even as a small child, I could not understand judging against a human being just because their skin was a different color. It made no sense. I knew some pretty detestable white people, and I knew some very kind, loving, smart black people.

The music is how scores should be...a part of the story and characters.The children are outstanding (hard to find in a movie).  You really get the sense of viewing this world through the eyes of a child.The courtroom scene is by far the best ever made.  I get angry every time the verdict is read.  Gregory Peck's closing argument shows just how perfect he was for the role of Atticus Finch.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of those movies that have these great moments that stay with me:  Atticus shooting the dog, Scout looking at the watch, Jem and Scout running to defend Atticus from the mob, Tom Robinson in tears when he states his innocence, Reverend Sykes asking Scount to ""stand up"", Atticus inching forward when he is spit upon, Scout saying, ""Hey, Boo""...the list of these moments could go on and on.And this DVD had one of the best commentary tracks about making films you will ever hear.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3GUHL469JV8Y1	"J. C. Liu ""Dr. Jimbob"""	I don't think anybody would question the greatness of the movie.  It just seems to hit on every level, from a screenplay artfully edited from the classic Harper Lee novel, to terrific and believable performances by everybody, especially the child actors; a great score by Elmer Bernstein; the spooky, wordless film debut of Robert Duvall; and of course Gregory Peck as the menschiest cinematic Dad of all time.  It's an unsparing look at racism, put forth before Martin Luther King had a dream, and before the Civil Rights Act.  A classic, and an essential film.The 50th anniversary repackaging is terrific -- it includes a Blu-Ray with a stunning picture and good sound, a standard def DVD, a downloadable digital copy which looks great on my MacBook and iPad, and a batch of nice extras.  The Blu-Ray comes with a batch of making-of featurettes, a retrospective of Gregory Peck's career, and a Q&A; session in which Peck reminisces about his career, especially the making of Mockingbird.  And the booklet has essays by Peck's wife Veronique, by Harper Lee, and -- this is especially nifty for actors out there -- reproductions of three pages of Peck's personal copy of the shooting script, with his dense annotations, edits, and notes which show the prodigious work that went into this remarkably low-key, understated performance.  it's revelatory to watch the scenes in question with the script in front of you.

He handles a difficult situation with the utmost level of professionalism.  He deals with racial hatred while teaching his two children that the world in which we live is filled with many types of hatred.  The lesson that he teaches is relived with every challenge that Atticus faces.  The strength Atticus shows us in dealing with the community and retaining the friendship of a wrongfully accused man is tremendous.  I would recommend this movie for families to watch as a family.  There is a strong message that we all can learn from on how to better deal with racial hatred.	5.0	Lesson to be learned	2003-06-15	1	1	0

This disc contains a few extras, all of which are very good. There are, of course, the requisite bios and production notes, but the running commentary and feature-length documentary are what make this worth spending the money.The commentary is by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula, and offers many insights into making the film. There are a couple of drawbacks to this commentary, one of which is Pakula talks very softly at times, making him difficult to understand. Another minor drawback is that when not offering great information, Pakula and Mulligan are often complimenting each other and all involved on what a great job they did on the film. This is not really a bad thing, as it's almost as if they can't believe that it came out as well as it did.The documentary, &quot;Fearful Symmetry,&quot; appears to be made especially for this DVD. It of course covers some of the same ground as the commentary, since Mulligan and Pakula are both interviewed, but it is a delight to see and hear from Gregory Peck, Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Robert Duvall, Brock Peters and others. Alford and Badham spin great tales about their experiences making the film and appear to have no regrets.

The book came out in 1960 and the movie in 1962, so of course the racial question was a hot button.  The movie does a pretty good job, in a lot of ways, of presenting a condensed version of the book, but the book is about soooo much more than just the racial issue.  All kinds of themes are worked into the fabric of the book, and I am really glad I finally read it.Watching the movie after reading the book seemed the natural way to go, and I hope anyone watching the movie who hasn't read the book will then read the book, because relatively minor changes do shift the flavor and import of the original work.	4.0	Good movie with departures from book reasonable	2013-03-12	0	0	0

It brings to life the best and the worst of which society and individuals are capable. Atticus is an amazing character of courage, integrity and modesty. Gregory  Peck IS Atticus Finch. His portrayal is so convincing that he is exactly  the phenomenal gentleman Harper Lee wrote of.  His conviction to justice  and respect for all people is unwavering and the epitome of character we  all should possess. The movie is haunting.  I saw it first as a child and  never forgot it.  I saw it again in my teens and was overwhelmed. As an  adult I have a full appreciation for its perfection and a great admiration  for the broad spectrum of life's lessons it brought to the screen.  A must  see movie, a must read book. Be sure to do both.  You won't be  dissapointed. Bravo!	5.0	To Kill a Mockingbird	1999-12-02	5	5	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan and Horton Foote have made an absolutely terrific movie of one of the greatest books in contemporary fiction.  The three years covered in the book are compressed into one year in the movie,  and almost everything of importance is kept in the film version.Shooting the movie in black and white was inspired.  It symbolizes the stark reality of black vs. white that is at the core of the novel. The acting is extraordinary across the board.  Of Gregory Peck, so much has been said that further praise is redundant; suffice to say that after Peck's performance, no one else will ever be able to play Atticus Finch.  The children are wonderful, so real that they hardly seem to be acting at all.  Mary Badham is absolutely perfect as Scout.  Phillip Alford is excellent as Jem, and John Megna is fine as Dill.  The lesser actors live up to the lead roles.  I especially liked Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell; James Anderson brings out all the ugliness and cowardice in Bob Ewell, and Alice Ghostley is a funny and wacky Stephanie Crawford.The three characters who didn't live up to their counterparts in the book were Miss Maudie, Calpurnia, and Tom Robinson.  Ms. Maudie is a very intriguing character in the novel, a ditzy, wise, funny woman of bedrock integrity; in the movie, she comes across as just another next door neighbor.  Calpurnia's part was far too small in the movie; in the book she plays a major role in the family, almost like a surrogate parent.  Estelle Evans is a fine actress and deserved a bigger role to give her talent more scope.  And Tom Robinson is almost too saintly to be believed in the film version, over-acted by Brock Peters.  But Robert Duvall in a non-speaking movie debut is just right as Boo Radley, and Scout's recognition of her formerly scary neighbor, with her tentative smile followed by 'Hey Boo', is one of the most affecting moments in the picture.I still remember when Peck won the Oscar for best actor; in his acceptance speech, his first words were 'Thank you, Harper  Lee.'  The movie 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a labor of love of bringing a timeless classic to the screen, and Harper Lee must have been very gratified at the results.Judy Lind	5.0	A magnificent adaptation of a timeless classic	2000-01-21	122	105	17
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A18P0T2NZTGWYX	J. Martin	My taste in movies has changed in the 50+ years since To Kill a Mockingbird was released. I loved it then (I loved the book too) and have remembered it fondly ever since. But now it seems stilted and phony, even the stuff with the kids. Everybody declaims; nobody talks the way real people talk; and Gregory Peck is overbearing and pompous, stiff and smug and cold as an icepick.It's a self-important and pretentious movie, overloaded with phony down-homeness and condescending socio-political moralizing - not entertaining or enlightening at all.

It is even rarer when said book is succesfully transformed to a movie.Gregory Peck gives a wonderful portrail as Atticus Finch, the single father of two children in the Depression Era south.  While the story revolves primarily around the lives of his two kids, Jem and Scout, it also centers on Atticus' involvement in the trial of a poor black man who is accussed of raping an even poorer white woman.This is a great movie and a must watch for anyone who wants to watch brilliant acting and brilliant characters.	5.0	An American Classic	2002-02-18	2	2	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"Gregory Peck was entirely deserving of the recognition that he got for playing Atticus Finch (including the Oscar for Best Actor), the strongest role in the movie was actually that of Scout (played by Mary Badham).  Badham was nominated for an Academy Award, and I feel that it is on the strength of Scout that this movie was carried.  While Peck may have been the moral backbone of the movie, it is Badham that is the heart of the movie and whom the film truly does revolve around.To Kill a Mockingbird is the film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same title.  The story deals with racism and morality in a very humanistic way.  When a black man is accused of raping a white woman, Atticus Finch takes the case to defend Tom Robinson (the man accused).  This is a story about race relations as well as community relations and in the end, about doing the right thing.  The house next to the Finch home is the Radley house.  There are stories and rumors and prejudices against the hidden Radley boy, Boo Radley (the screen debut of Robert Duvall).  Somehow, the stories about the Radley home come together with the trial of Tom Robinson and the moment where Scout gently says, ""hey Boo"" is truly a beautiful moment.I could probably heap praise on this movie until my fingers can't type anymore, but I am simply going to end by saying this is a movie than anybody who wants to watch a great movie needs to see this.  Both the book and the movie are truly American classics."	5.0	a masterpiece of american cinema	2003-03-27	4	4	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ALYTF0FTVHUYN	John Bernier	The art of story telling is rare in film today.  Without a car case or a gun battle, what is the point of making a movie?  But on a rare occasion a timeless film is made that sets the mark of excellence.  To Kill A Mockingbird is one of those films.Filmed in Black and White, although color was available then, the film captures the sleepy town of Macomb where tree lined dirt roads prevail, neighbors know one another and check in on each other, and the only thing a kid has to entertain himself is the endless miles of fields and a vivid imagination.The task of transforming the Harper Lee novel into film is not easy.  How does a writer take a Pulitzer Prize novel and boil it down to a slick 120 minute story.  With just a few exceptions the whole of this novel is kept and is well presented in the film.Gregory Peck in the lead role of Atticus Finch was key.  But Peck presence is only the glue that holds the film together.  The true triumph of this film is in the casting of Mary Badham and Phillip Alford as the lead characters of  Scout and Jem.  The selection of two unknowns from Birmingham, Alabama made this film.  The naivt'e of the children is apparent and beliveable and gives the film the sense of innocense lost as Jem and Scout learn that the world is not a fair place.This film also marks some early performance of Alice Ghostly and Aunt Stephanie the aunt of Del Harris who is based on the real life childhood of Truman Capote and the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley.This film is a treat.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A19DC6V3VPW7LZ	John Nava	"While attending a a film class at a San Diego community college back in the 80's, the instructor told is how badly Hitchcock's classic horror film, PSYCHO, was structured. His chief complaint is how the film spends twenty to twenty-five minutes on a character which we never see again and how everything is wrapped up so neatly by another character, the psychologist, who appears only in the last two or three minutes! Well. if the screenplay of PSYCHO has a bad structure--TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD takes the cake! I haven't read the prize-winning Harper Lee semiautobiographical novel, but if my nephew had written a similarly-structured script for his Walter screenwriting class at UCLA, it would have been thrown out!First of all, the film is divided in two parts. Sorry, but this is a film--not a two act play. The first half concentrates on Scout and really builds up her character. The second half is sedentary court-room drama. So, Mr. Foote, Ms Lee, WHO'S STORY IS IT???Boo Radley's father is a peripheral character and could have easily been omitted. If I recall, and I just watched the film the other day after over twenty-five years, he doesn't even have a line of dialogue!Worse still, and equal to the first point I mention above, is the visual introduction of the Boo charcter after two hours of light on a screen! It's almost like a thankless role, and yet he is the symbolic ""mockingbird"" of the tale. He's not just Simon Oakland wrapping things up and making all ends meet as he does in the final minutes of PSYCHO.Don't get me wrong, it is a most well intentioned film and well-timed as far as the socio-political events unfolding in the country at the time, but in addition to Foote's poor structure, Robert Mulligan was just the wrong director for this heavy theme.I saw it on VHS and I can't remember if it was the late producer Alan Pakula or not, who says in a short interview segment following the film, that no film had ever been made at that time which was from a child's POV. Err, excuse me, Mr. Pakula, ever heard of Rene' Clement's JEUX INTERDITS (Forbidden Games, 1952)? Also, the original trailer is shown at the beginning before the movie.

Rosenberg	"Mockingbird killing revisitedSome classic movies remain relevant long after the era they portrayed passed into memory.  Some should be left untouched.  Except for the acting of Gregory Peck and Brock Peters, the movie version of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird seems like a slow moving story going at 33 rpm in a world that's on warp speed 40 years after the movies release.The movie set in Black and White cinematography moves slowly with its plot introducing all the characters especially the children in little vignettes.  Yet for a movie about the mistreatment of African-Americans in the 1930's rural south, there is little exposition about the key figure, Tom Robinson, the man accused of rape by a spinster white women or the lives Blacks lived in that era.The movie glorified the courage of Atticus Finch, played stoically by Peck, who took to the unsuccessful defense of Robinson, who dies off-screen, much as the activities of the blacks in this movie are used to highlight Finch's lack of prejudice.  Where the Whites in the movie are portrayed in shades of gray from unrelenting bigotry to middling tolerance,  all the black characters are presented as noble savages with great dignity and idol-like appreciation for the attorney's defense.  40 years ago there was a lump in my throat, when the Black community seated in the balcony of the courthouse, stood silently to honour attorney Finch, now there was a look to my watch to see when this tale would come to an end.Some parts of this drama still work, the attack on Finch's children by the wronged spinster's father and defense by recluse Boo Radley played by Robert Duvall, still works well as well as the sheriff's(played by Frank Overton) failure to prosecute Radley.  However, even that ending is marred by the reverential liberalism that the racists death cancels out Tom Robinson's.  But every black character even the Finch maid and nanny, Calpurnia, is shown with respect and anonymity.  Its as if the movie's creative team were afraid to show three dimensional African American life, proving once again in the words of Nat ""King"" Cole, ""Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark.""Joseph B.

It won three academy awards and was quite daring and innovative for 1962 to talk about rape by a black man of a white teenager. The story takes place in a small Southern town in 1935, and highlights the relationships of children with the town, and the events are seen through their eyes, and of course, the white town's view of the black people. The young girl tomboy Scout (the narrator)is a hoot, but probably will have real behavior problems in adulthood.  The other children are her brother Jem and the neighbor boy Dill. The plot has been repeated in the South many times, black man falsely accused and covicted, and then eventually killed while ""trying to escape."" The real white suspect in this story is later killed when the mentally handicapped neighbor stops him from harming the children.  Gregory Peck was deserving of an academy award for playing the conversative lawyer Atticus Finch, the father of Scout and Jem, a part different than his typical role as a war/cowboy hero.

It portraits a book in the best possible way. The story is about siblings Scout and Jem growing up in a small quiet southern town in the 30's with their father, a lawyer and widower called Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck). Little is happening in the town and the kids spend alot of their time outside playing and stalking on a neighbour ""Boo"" Radley who is considered mentally disturbed and dangerous. Most of the film is told in the eyes of the little girl Scout (It could just aswell have been the author herself talking of her childhood). At early stage their father will teach them to not have prejudices and to show both humanity, acceptance and not judge people from the outside. In one particular scene when a young boy was invited to their home for dinner he will use as much syryp as possible for his food and Scout ridiculate him for doing that, when her father intervenes and tells her not to judge the boy for that his behavior.When a black man called Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is getting accused for rape of a white woman, Finch takes the tough responsabilty to defend him. He puts himself in a dangerous situation when most people of the town have already decided he's guilty before proven innocent an just want to hang him. Finch will not only get threaten by the young woman's father but he will also protect Tom from his jail cell when a mob arrives to fight and he'll do his best in proving what shortly get's obvious; That Tom Robinson is innocent. Peck proves why he's one of our finest actors in a very memorable court scene where he gives a long speach, summing up the case and proving why Tom was judged by the colour of his skin rather then for the proof that was brought into the court in his favour. Other then Peck, I would also like to give credit for Peters great performence in the courtroom where he tells his story in the most honest and emotional ways possible and ofcourse to the briliant child performences from Jem and Scout, the credability of their roles give the film extra tension and throughout the film it's very exciting to follow what is going to happen next since there are many pieces to put together.This is not only a classic film portaiting a small society with racism in the 30's but also about doing what is right and to have courage to do so even if it sometimes hard opposition and your chances are very slim. It's also about morality and to not judge people from the outside (There is a quite un-expected ending that will teach the kids a valuable lesson also). ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a true classic and one of those films that you should have seen. It may be over 40 years old and in black and white but that doesn't take away either it's beauty or magnificient portrayal. Classic."	5.0	A Lawyer, A Father and A Hero	2007-01-04	5	5	0

"In 2006, was introduced to this marvellous work by a co-worker who said this was her favorite film (""and you love movies and you've never SEEN it? You MUST!""). Bought this Legacy edition (was then the ""latest/greatest"" release of film), and oh yes, total agreement with her opinion. Strangely enough, she never acquired a copy herself, so when she recently retired, I gave her my copy (tri-fold, with lobby cards: a LOVELY set). Went shopping for replacement, saw glowing reviews for new blu, but (for my 1st time ever), opted to just replace the original Legacy copy, ONLY due to it's cover/overall packaging. BEFORE you start bashing, read DVD reviews going back to '98 release: they are uniformly excellent for quality (and extras). I do not care for Universal's new packaging art, but I suppose they really could not improve on the Legacy (nor could they reproduce it for a new release). If quality of packaging is no big deal, consider the new release; if having an exquisite TRULY ""Collector's Ed."" (what an overused term in dvd market) in your library is paramount -or to give as gift- I would recommend the Legacy. (please note, the 2nd used copy I just bought has only a bi-fold case, and no lobby cards. Still pleased with, and my friend DID get those added items!).

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4	"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton"""	In a twist of time and fate I was viewing 'To Kill A Mockingbird' on DVD when AFI released their choice of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Lee Harper's character Atticus Finch, the Southern lawyer who defends a black man unjustly accused of rape, as Hollywood's all-time movie hero.  No character in film history has more deserved to be designated as the best 'good guy'. Peck garnered a well-deserved Oscar for his role as a man of understated wisdom and quiet courage and the quintessential father-figure all men should aspire to be and all children long for in their lives.  The fact that this film, it's participants, and the basic story are still being honored after 40+ years is a testament to the solid message if offered and the effective manner in which it was presented.I read this Pulitzer Prize novel when it was published and saw the film upon its theatrical release.  The memory of both have long lingered.  Enough can't be said about the wisdom of Universal's decision to release this Collector's Edition DVD. The public owes them a monumental 'thank-you'. Interviews with Gregory Peck and commentary by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula make us privy to their precious memories surrounding how the charming novel was transformed into the perfect film.  Seeing Mary Badham (Scout) and Philip Alford (Jem) (non-professional southern children starring in an Oscar-nominated film) as adults offering insights into their unique experiences was an unbelievable treat.  To watch Robert Duvall make his screen debut as 'Boo Radley', and what a debut that was; and to hear his comments nearly a half-century later proves as never before the value of the DVD format and special features.Watching this film upon its release it was inconceivable that we could one day far in the future hear and see the inside story of its making in the comfort of our homes and from the mouths of the individuals so instrumental in the process of creating a legend.This DVD is priceless. The details of the making of this time-honored film have now been documented forever in a piece of movie-history that deserves to be savored by any true movie-buff as well as by a generation not yet born at the time of it's release.  The message and the method of communicating it are timeless and dear.  Please do yourself the honor of viewing this film.	5.0	Timeless film still being honored...and deservedly so	2003-06-06	37	36	1

I watched it yet again, and it was still fresh and enjoyable.  (""Enjoyable"" might be the wrong word, here.  I think ""disturbing"" might be truer.)  Gregory Peck plays a widower with a young daughter, who live in the South.  As an attorney, he is defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. The story is hard to watch, at times, but it delves deep into the best of men and the worst of men.  I think the movie is a realistic view of the place and time, perfectly cast, not corny or sappy.  If anyone hasn't seen this movie (and I supposed that some younger people may not have), it is well worth your while to do so. It is definitely a keeper for me."	5.0	To Kill A Mockingbird - Excellent Classic!	2011-07-22	1	1	0

I began by telling them it was a wonderful movie, but when it started in black and white, they decided it was awful and must be a movie only English teachers like.  When I had to turn it off at the end of class though, they all begged me to keep watching it.To Kill a Mockingbird is not another film of a classic book that only literature nerds will enjoy.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3H29WN34BSS1Y	"ka ""opalglass"""	With the all the other heroic roles Gregory Peck played, his potryal of middle-aged Atticus Finch, with no particular good-looks to speak form, was his greatest as his sole Academy Award proves. Although, in the terms of scenes covered, the film may not be very faithful to the equally brilliant book, it retains the true spirit of the story (as well as the major scenes). To add to that, the casting is perfect; the character are all just how I imagined them. The children were particularly impressive, making their characters realistic; Mary Badham acts her role with a childish innocence, very relevant to her character of Scout, which delightful to watch.The movie is full of wonderful scenes, with the court trial being the highlight. Gregory Peck's closing defence speech consists of some of the greatest film dialogue of all time. For readers and non-readers of Harper Lee' book, this film will be enjoyable and shame on those (particularly a certain reviewer) who cannot appreciate its message.	5.0	Atticus Finch - the greatest hero of all time	2003-08-23	2	2	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ATG30PJGSSUWQ	Karl Kronlage	Yes, this is a classic, but I'm a little tired of people saying that no one wants to remake this movie because the original is so perfect.  Yes, Gregory Peck is fantastic.  Yes, it hooks the viewer, especially the court room scenes.  But my main problem with the movie is what it deletes.  No Miss Dubose taunting Jem so much that it drives him into vandalism.  No cousin Francis teasing Scout. No D. Raymond telling us racism for mixed children.  While watching the movie, we believe that Mr. Ewell is a racist, but the book hammers the point in that the entire town is racist.  I personally would love to see a remake that highlights this as well; however, it would be impossible to find a better Atticus.  And perhaps everyone is right - a remake would inevitable be compared to an excellent movie.  Even if (as I watch it now) it feels a little dated.	3.0	People forget that it differs from the book	2014-05-09	1	0	1

Based on Harper Lee's only novel of the same name, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a cinematic achieve that transcends time.  This movie, directed by Robert Mulligan stars one of America's most professional artists Gregory Peck.  Peck plays Atticus Finch, the widower-father of his son Jem and daughter Scout.""To Kill"" is one of those few picture experiences where the movie translates the feel and essence of a book.  I remember the first time I read Harper's book and then catching the movie a few years later (I read the book in 1979) and I was mesmerized that Peck was to me, Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham was Scout and Philip Alford is Jem.This movie is the standard for all art, for it speaks about transcendent justice and right over wrong, good vs. evil and the harsh realities these ideas and realities bring forth; but it also speaks to wonder, mystery, love and courage - things worth living for.The extras are nice and seeing Peck in his twilight with his family is warm.  The bonus feature on making ""To Kill"" is great and many of teh people acting in the film as well as other social commentators, recall memories as well as the films social importance.Thank you Gregory Peck; Thank you Harper Lee; Thank you to all who worked on this great piece of art...we are much better people for it."	5.0	One of the Greatest Movies Ever with a Great DVD Collection	2005-10-07	5	5	0

Finch is defending a black man who has been accused of assaulting a white woman.  The trial introduces Finch's children, Jem and Scout, to racism and to tragedy.Peck is superb as the noble lawyer and tender father.  The story is sweet and sobering; very thought-provoking.  I heartily recommend this unforgettable film.	5.0	"""It's a sin to kill a mockingbird."""	2002-06-15	2	2	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ABLOQZIL42W7I	"kone ""kone"""	"This is a turly classic film that has been universally recognized as one of the greatest films of all time. It is told from the eyes of a young girl named ""Scout"", the 6 year old daughter of a county lawyer, Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham marvelously plays ""Scout"", a Tom-boy, who with her brother ""Jem"", and friend ""Dill"" witness the events that swept them into the eye of the hurricane of racial hatred.  While the three children are consumed by the rumors about their mysterious neighbor, ""Boo"" Radley, Scout's father, Atticus Finch, prepares to defend the black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white girl.  Gregory Peck is absolutley fabulous as Atticus Finch.  Peck nails the character of Atticus the lawyer who defends the wrongfully accused black man of raping a white woman in the deep racial South in 1935. The outcome of the trial was a given, guilty; yet, Atticus courageously stands up to the prejudicial all-white jury and angrilly demands them to find the courage to stand up for the truth and set free an innocent man.  Yet, the social rules of the time demanded a guilty verdict and it was brought.  Robinson despairs and breaks away during a transfer and is shot and killed.  All seems lost, and Atticus and his children despair.  But the end is not yet. Bob Euell, the father of the girl who claimed rape has a hatred of Atticus that cannot be quenched even by the death of Robinson.  He blindly hates Atticus for daring to take the opinion of a black man over a white man.  Since he does not have the courage to face Atticus, he instead goes after Scout and Jem.  Suddenly and unexpectedly, the children are rescued by their mysterious reclusive neighbor Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, who was the children's protector, despite his mental retardation.The movie ends in a touching scene where Scout slowly walks Boo back to his house holding his pale hand in hers.  She then returns to the secure and comforting lap of her father Atticus, who is dutifully watching over injured Jem.  In the background is a picture of Atticus' deceased wife on the mantle, (the first view we have of her).  The love of this father for his children is clearly evident in his tenderness and decency.Oh how this world could so richly benefit from more honorable and courageous men like Atticus Finch.Buy this movie and watch it once a year with your children.  As your children age, they will see the deeper social message which is the heart of the movie.Jim Koenig"	5.0	Gregory Peck's Greatest Movie	2008-01-18	0	0	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2087JBOXEPFM6	"Kuldip Kumar Garhwal ""Kuldip"""	"Destruction of the innocent by the evils of the societyKuldip Kumar Garhwal""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but... sing their heart out for us. That's why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird."" The movie 'To kill a mockingbird' depicts the destruction of the innocent by the evils of the society. Mockingbird is a symbol of innocence, characterized by Tom Robinson and Arthur Radley (Boo) where racial prejudice and ignorance are the symbol of evils in the society.Tom Robinson, an African-American is accused by Mayela, a white woman, of sexual molestation. Atticus, a prominent lawyer of the town Maycomb, has proved that Tom Robinson is innocent but still the ""all-white jury"" convicts Robinson of the guilt. Tom Robinson, a ""quite humble respectable Negro"", becomes the victim of racial prejudice. Arthur Radley (Boo) has been emotionally destroyed by his father, as his father did not let him step outside the house. Boo is one of the ""mockingbirds"" in the story, who is the victim of ignorance; evil of the society which is trying to kill the good. Boo had a deep affection for children, which is later displayed in the story, when Boo saves Jim and Scout from Bob Ewells.""There are some men in the world who are born to do unpleasant jobs for us; your father is one of them"", said Maudie to Jim after his father (Atticus) lost the case of Tom Robinson. Atticus helped his children to learn values of life and he showed them how to live life by the values; preaching by practicing. Atticus allowed his children to call him by his name instead of 'father'. He wanted his children to explore freedom, but also taught them to stay in limits. Jim is brave, intelligent, and caring. He learns courage, dignity, and value of life from his father. He is transforming into adulthood.Scout is still a kid; she does not know anything about the existence of evil in the society. She is learning about evils from the real life example of the victims (Tom and Boo) of the evils in the society. By the end of the story Scout's perspective on life develops from that of an innocent child into that of a near grown up. ""Mr. Tate was right"", said Scout to Atticus, after Mr. Tate, the town Sheriff explained Atticus indirectly that whatever Boo did was correct and he is not supposed to be punished for that. ""It would be like shooting the mockingbird, wouldn't it."" Scout shows a high level of ability to comprehend at the age of five, and understands the whole situation and judges what is right and what is wrong.The Music Director of the movie has done an excellent job. Music plays an important role in the movie, by setting the mood for what is been screened. The movie starts with a musical note, which seems like it is played by a kid, one note at a time. The movie also has gothic music to create the horrifying or thrilling environment, when Jim and Scout were walking home after the Halloween Party and they had an encounter with Bob Ewells. Most of the places the movie has melancholy music to produce the feeling of thoughtful sadness. The pleasant arrangements of musical notes in the movie create an atmosphere where we feel that we are a part of the movie, and we go back into our nostalgic memories and look back into our childhood. The movie itself seems like a mockingbird song.My favorite scene in the movie is when Atticus is walking out of the courtroom after the trial is over and all the ""colored"" people sitting in the balcony stands up to pay respect to Atticus, a white man, who tried his level best to save a ""Negro."" The Reverend says to Scout who was sitting, ""Stand up Jean Louise. Your father is passing.""  The scene says it all, there is not much dialogue but the expressions on the faces of the black people was marvelous, with a slow melancholy music at the background. As it this situation there is nothing left to say, because everyone knows in the courtroom that Tom Robinson is not guilty but still the jury has convicted him of the rape, just because of racial prejudice._____________________________________________Kuldip Kumar Garhwal(...)"	5.0	Destruction of the innocent by the evils of the society	2004-07-19	8	8	0

Of course movies cannot and almost never will match the books they are taken from but this movie is still one of the best ever.  The acting was truly sensational and the story will lift your heart and leave a lump in your throat, as it should.  I've owned this DVD for going on a year now and have watched it at least 15 times since then.  And in that time, it still enthralls me just as it did the first time I saw it.  There have been many attempts over the years to make movies such as priceless as this one (and quite a few have done very well) but I think this one stands alone as a testament to the wonderful talents of some very gifted actors, writers and moviemakers who will leave a powerful legacy for others to live up to.	5.0	An American Masterpiece	2001-02-24	3	3	0

He was about 6 years old, he held out his tiny hand and introduced himself as ""ATTICUS"". He told me that this parents, who were sitting behind us, had named him after their favourite film character.This little boy was bright and super intelligent. He told me about the film and why it was so great. He said that his parents, who were both lawyers, wanted to name him after someone who did great things. He told me that he had hoped to do great things too, when he grew up. I hope that he did.The film, itself, was groundbreaking, a seminal work. The cast in the film: Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch), Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Collin Wilcox (Maybella Ewell), Brock Peters (Tom Robinson) and Robert Duvall (Boo Radley), were wonderful.I have loved ""Bobby Duvall"", ever since this film...There is so much in this movie, the complexities of human nature, the love of a parent for his young children, who are growing up in a mis-understood, divided world. The desire to set things right, the need to prove that wrong is wrong and to stand tall in the faces of adversity. This film has it all.There is nothing more that I could add that has not already been discussed by writers and film makers around the world.For me, seeing this film in high school and at home and then meeting (many years ago) a little, smart boy on a plane, who  was actually named ""Atticus"", was the height of my experience with this film. The child was a joy to talk to and his understanding and knowledge of the film, was remarkable.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3K8O01S0XGWHT	"Larry Bridges ""thebachelor"""	"It says a lot that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was made in 1962, at a time when Hollywood was finally able to address the civil rights issue and congratulate itself on its courage for doing so, while not actually presenting material that would be truly challenging to American audiences.  If a film like this had been made even ten years earlier, it would have constituted an act of true artistic courage.  Made in 1962, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a work of great artistry, but there is nothing overwhelmingly courageous about it.Critical response to the film version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" seems to fall into two categories.  The majority of reviewers have praised the film's beauty and simplicity, its wonderfully natural and understated performances, and its loving evocation of a long-gone place and time.  A minority of commentators, including Roger Ebert, have criticized the film's lapses of believability and its use of African-American characters as symbols rather than individuals.I think that both views are clearly correct.  The performances of the entire cast -- in particular, Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Brock Peters -- bring the story to life so naturally that the viewer seems to be watching the lives of real people rather than a movie.  As Mulligan and Pakula point out on their DVD commentary, the entire film is handled with a dignity and restraint that would be unthinkable in later eras of the history of motion pictures.On the other hand, the film features less meaningful interaction between the black and white characters than one might have hoped -- less, indeed, than takes place in Harper Lee's novel.  Tom Robinson, the African-American character most central to the plot, never comes into direct contact with Scout, the viewpoint character.  She witnesses his tragedy like a spectator at a play, never seeming to grapple with it personally.  When the repercussions of Tom Robinson's story finally threaten Scout and Jem in the film's third act, it is a white character who endangers them and another white character who saves them.The only African-American character who walks through the movie as a regular person rather than a tragic symbol is Calpurnia, Atticus' household employee, excellently played by Estelle Evans.  In earlier Hollywood eras, few black characters could have interacted with whites so naturally and straightforwardly, or been presented as strong and intelligent individuals in their own right without any trace of comedy.  But even Calpurnia seems to fade out of the story as it proceeds, and we never see her reaction to the fate of Tom Robinson.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a treasurable movie, in particular for its depiction of the unusual relationship of mutual respect between Atticus and his children and for Elmer Bernstein's score, featuring one of the loveliest main themes ever to come out of Hollywood.  But it probably does not deserve to be regarded as one of America's greatest films.  Most mockingbirds are gray, but there are two mockingbirds in this movie:  one white and one black.  Only the white mockingbird perches on the heroine's shoulder to sing his song, and that's a bit disappointing."	4.0	"""And little things in between"""	2007-09-15	3	2	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2T5EVP6D16HPX	Larry Roach	To Kill A Mockingbird is arguably one of the greatest American films ever. You will never be dissapointed. However, do not waste your time with the commentary. I have bought some lousy DVD's (ex.&quot;Idle Hands&quot;) just for the joy of the inventive commentary. This is a classic with a horrible commentary. Director Robert Mulligan gives some good insight when he is allowed to speak. On the other hand Producer Alan Pakula (whose work I have always admired)unfortunately monopolizes the conversation, should have left the matter in Mulligan's hands and stayed out. His comments are interminably redundant: he must mentioned the key being the kid's point of view 800 times (have you no other thing to offer?), constant stroking of Mulligan whom he refers to monotonously in the third person (&quot;Bob&quot; does this or that)even though they are sitting beside one another, and frequently whispers his comments to Mulligan so as not to include the audience (perhaps a blessing, but annoying in its exclusion). One of the most aggravating issues is slighting the actors (except the kids and Peck), not introducing them or talking much about them and ignoring some amazing choices (chief among being Collin Wilcox just barely not touching the Bible as she prepares to testify and lie - brilliant or didn't they notice?). Buy the movie. Ignore the disservice they do to their own work by talking about it.	5.0	Watch the movie not the commentary	2002-01-21	3	3	0

The ideas are timeless. Atticus says to his son upon being asked why he took the Tom Robinson case, 'because I couldn't hold my head up if I said no.'Timeless stuff. Great family film.

Like many rumors, there is much more to the story, which will become apparent toward the end of the movie.The stark black and white images perfectly depicted the settings and the deprivation of this small town world.  Yet despite their lack of material trappings, the children found plenty to amuse themselves, utilizing their minds and their imaginations.The themes of the film are fear, racism, and integrity--and the latter trait was depicted most notably by Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch.The lessons in understanding and empathy came specifically from Atticus, as spoken to his children:  You never really know a person until you walk for awhile in his shoes.This filmTo Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)is still very relevant, despite the fact that some race relations have been improved.

Griffin Jr.	Harper Lee's novel, on which the screenplay for this film is based, is one of the very finest American novels.  The film is as fine as the book.  The storyline follows the lives of three children, playmates in an small fictional Alabama County seat town (Maycomb in Maycomb County) where Atticus Finch, an attorney and father of two of the children is working to defend a black man who is falsely accused of the rape of a white woman.  The story deals with honor and dishonor, racism, hatred, bigotry and redeeming love.  It treats with gentle irony and profound moral insight the legal, social and spiritual issues of cruel poverty and heroic moral courage when that poverty, together with stupidity and moral cowardice call for taking the right course even when there is no possibility of victory.  It is a story of the triumph of decency and grace where both are out of keeping with old codes and evil assumptions.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"Released in 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird ranks #34 on the AFI top 100 movie list and shows clearly just how powerful a classic movie can be. Where many movies fade and wither in time, To Kill a Mockingbird remains just as powerful, just as memorable as when it was first filmed. In other movies the characters can feel dated. The acting can seem shoddy. People make excuses about ""well, it was only the 1960s. What can you expect."" THIS is what you can expect. The dialogue is stellar. The acting is superb. Even in black and white, even with the limited technology available, you get sucked in, immersed, and feel the full reality of what is going on. This is what high quality movie making is all about.The movie is a perfect window into events which were all too familiar during the Great Depression. People struggled to get by. They had to try to pay their bills with crops grown in their back yard. People with mental illness were treated little better than dogs. Women were beaten. Into all of this comes young Scout, a girl growing up with her older brother and widowed father. She is a tomboy, eager to speak out and fight for her cause. The worst thing her brother can accuse her of is acting like a ""girl"". She has strong ideals and is not afraid to voice them.Her father, a lawyer, is tapped to represent a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. Most of the town wants to lynch the poor accused man, although some townsfolk see the injustice of it. Scout leaps into fights with her schoolmates to defend the honor of her father. And ironically, when her father is threatened, it is her willingness to speak up and say what she feels that helps to soothe the situation.I can't say enough good things about this film. Gregory Peck is incredible. He gives just the right touch to so many scenes. You can see in his eyes the mix of emotions as he stands strong on the steps before the mob. When his son is hurt, and he's standing outside the window trying desperately to figure out what to do, my heart ached for him. His strength in the courtroom, and his tenderness with his kids is just stunning.I have seen this movie many times, and I look forward to seeing it many more. Every time someone tries to make a case for a shoddy movie from the 60s or 50s, claiming ""well it's just how movies were made back then"", I point to this one. THIS is how fine movies were made in this time period. This shows great acting, great dialogue, and a mix of characters who are authentic and interesting and respectful of their origins. The mentally ill man is not treated as a joke. He is a real human being. The drunkard father, the lying daughter, and the plight of the black members of the community are all shown with clarity and realism.It is a minor, interesting note, that despite the movie seeming to revolve around women, they never talk with each other! It's all about how men impact their lives. Scout is central but she is primarily talked to by her father and brother. Those are the influences she cares about. Only briefly does the nanny character talk with her. Similarly, the lying daughter is another key character but she is only ever talked to / at by the lawyer and her father. The movie is about how the women are handled / guided by men. I think the only time a female really talks to any of these women is when the nanny scolds Scout for how she behaves to a guest. That's the one instance in the entire film.Highly recommended in the strongest possible words. Everyone should see this film."	5.0	A Must-Watch	2012-05-17	2	1	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3CDEDCYZRHWRW	ljandherray	To Kill a Mockingbird 50th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] This review is for the Blu-Ray disc only as I have not yet viewed the DVD version nor downloaded the Digital Copy. I do not feel it necessary to review this classic film. Unless the subject matter is not suitable for one's age, everyone in the free world has surely seen the film entitled, To Kill a Mockingbird, or at the very least read the book. If not, shame on your High School English teacher! To Kill a Mockingbird was required reading when I was in High School & I could not put the book down until I had turned the very last page! To say that it is a page turner is not only redundant, it is also an understatement. However, this review is about the Blu-Ray not the book. Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled to learn that To Kill a Mockingbird was showing in my home town movie theater. Having read the book, my sister & I absolutely could not wait to see the film. We no sooner returned home from the movie theater when we agreed to change the names of our two Finches (tiny caged birds). Mine was renamed Atticus Finch & my sister chose the name Scout Finch. Thus, I have read the book which remains on my bookshelf to this very day, purchased a ticket to watch To Kill a Mockingbird when it was initially released in movie theaters & I own the film version on both VHS & DVD. Yet I could not manage to resist purchasing this 50TH Anniversary Edition on Blu-Ray, DVD & Digital Copy for the incredibly reasonable price offered by Amazon. The Remastered Blu-Ray quality is truly excellent. Thankfully it remains in Black & White. There are many Bonus Features. So many in fact that I have no doubt it could take  several weeks to view all. The interviews with the actors are extremely interesting & entertaining. A true fan of the film To Kill a Mockingbird cannot go wrong with this set. It comes with two discs, one DVD, the other Blu-Ray, along with instructions about how to download the Digital Copy from your PC. The Blu-Ray is in 1080p High Definition Widescreen 1.85:1 which is apparent as once again, the picture quality is just incredible. The DVD is Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Both are in English & French but surprisingly not Spanish & both have English, Spanish & French subtitles. Some of the Special Features are in 1080i/p High Definition & some in 480i/p Standard Definition. I highly recommend this 50TH Anniversary Edition of the enduring classic film, To Kill a Mockingbird!	5.0	Excellent Remaster To Blu-Ray!	2012-02-11	6	6	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A14S51Z9I7DZR1	"Lloyd W. Deramus ""Plugger"""	I think this is a movie that shows you how people get into a thought pattern that is hard to break even in its cruelty.  It is also a warning for anyone who gets power to beware lest you become that which you formly hated.  When I see the original movie Walking Tall I have asked if the sheriff who was forced to become mean to win his battle could ever change back to his former self.  I often watch To Kill a Mockingbird and ask myself if the people could change or would tough times just force them to remain the same.  A good movie to make you think about society and how beliefs form.	5.0	It never gets old.	2014-06-05	1	1	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2PA50XN192XPH	L. M.  Butler	TIMELESS. As long as we are human beings living on this planet, this movie will remain relevant.  The film gods must have sprinkled it with star dust because it is magical. I see the word 'dated' being used a lot these days. I suspect by young people or immature adults who are not bright enough to understand a period piece film within it's 'time' context. This movie transcends time. It's not about time or anything like that. Every actor is relevant. Every scene relevant. The action and the plot flow. But more importantly, it sends a timeless message.The actor who played &#34;Bob Ewell&#34; James K Anderson, was hand-picked by Director Robert Mulligan. It's quoted someplace where he told Mulligan, 'I can play this character. I know him.' pretty chilling. And Robert Duvall is unforgettable as Boo Radley and he never says a word.I wager this movie will remain important in the year 2525!	5.0	TRANSCENDS TIME	2013-11-14	0	0	0

I think this movie should be seen by children as young as six.  After all, isn't scout six, isn't this about the world through the eye of a child.  A movie like this approaches the violence and hatred in the world as responsible as one can approach the subject.  Considering what young kids see on TV now, we can't shelter kids forever.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1E6UE6TXEKC43	Lucas	"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is, in my opinion, absolutely the finest film ever made.  Filmed in timeless black and white and perfectly cast, this motion picture is a work of art.  As for the ""politically correct"" reviewer who panned the film because of perceived ""black stereotyping"", and suggested it not be shown to anyone under 21 years of age, all I can say is sad.....very sad.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" should be required viewing for every child in public school in America, it might actually help to counter the influences of Darwinism and Secular Humanism that are destroying American culture and civility.The performance of Robert Duvall as ""Boo"" Radley is, alone, worth the price of admission, but John Megna, as young ""Dill"" Harris, steals the film as far as I'm concerned.  Megna, the brother of actress Connie Stevens, passed away in 1995 but will always be remembered for his role as ""Dill"".Everyone should, in my opinion, own a copy of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".  And if you watch it.....and aren't moved by it.....well, maybe you should have a close family member call the undertaker."	5.0	The best movie that Hollywood has ever made.....	2004-12-26	4	3	1

At our bible class this past sunday we had an hour long lesson onlearning to respect all nationalities in the whole world. God did create us all. We are truly all related. The father  displayed good principles in his own life and taught his children values. To feel the pain of others, and compassion. Our children today are flooded with bad information and behavior. Grand Theft auto should be outlawed as dangerous to our youth and their children mimmic what they see...when it is paraded in front of their eyes...it is in their minds in a distorted way. As their little minds are not mature enough to digest such terrible examples...it will affect their behaviour later. Just look around and you will see it.Sad our government does not care to regulate videos, movies and advertising on television and around town in video stores. Putting women on ads in very immodest clothing, and cigarettes in hands and alcohol in their other hands on billboards.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1G0H6150SO5G7	Lynette S. Gaines	The movie version of To Kill a Mockingbird was cast so well and follows the book closely. I have watched it so many times I can't keep track, but it's like visiting a dear friend again.I bought the DVD for a young friend of mine who hadn't even heard of the book or film and I was convinced that she would love it, but she didn't.  She refuses to watch any movie that's in B&W; and even though she watched this one she thought it was predictable and boring. How can that be possible?  I consider this film a classic that has aged well through the years but maybe younger audiences aren't interested in character developement and an excellent story. They want action, sex, and/or gratuitous violence which, fortunately, this movie doesn't offer and shouldn't need to. (In all fairness, I wasn't impressed with Citizan Kane and it's considered one of the greatest films of all time!)	5.0	American Classic	2008-01-27	0	0	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2Z5O8XQ4F0JTO	Lynn F. Casella	The movie is a classic, and even though it is in black and white, its authenticity to the book, except in just a few details, adds to itssignificance.The director of the movie took the liberty to put Scout in a papier mache hard cased ham costume, while in the book she was in a chicken wire and cloth costume, which added to the danger when she was attacked by Mr. Ewell. The wire was flexible and hard on the skin. Also, in the final scene in the movie Boo was hidden by the door, whereas in the book he was just in the corner and visible to all.Robert Duvall played an excellent Boo in his debut role. Gregory Peck was a precise and perceptive Atticus Finch. The actor who played Tom Robinson recently died, but gained fame in his role. It is interesting to note that the character of Dill was patterned after Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote, in her own words.While she spent four years writing the novel, which eventually earned the Pulitzer Prize, her audience and readers have enjoyed many years enjoying not only the book, which is one of 130 banned books because of the exposure of racism, but also the movie.	5.0	To Kill A Mockingbird VHS movie	2005-09-03	5	3	2

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1B05INWIDZ74O	M. A. Ramos	The setting for this movie is a dusty southern town in Alabama during the depression and is shot through the perspective of a child's eye. Mr. Gregory Peck does a superb job of playing a southern lawyer who defends a black man who is accused of rape by a white woman and her father. There is no question as you watch the movie of two things; the outcome of the trial and the fact the man is obviously innocent.In this movie we have a great example of a man, Gregory Pecks character, setting a good example of a parent and of being a good member of a community. He instills good values in his children, shows tremendous courage and strength of character. He teaches that you cannot judge a person until you can see the world through their eyes. He is a peerless man, in that everyone is his peer. This is a film whole families should watch together.	5.0	A must see film!	2007-01-18	3	3	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1D90MKRWB0ZKP	March boy	Academy award nominations: Picture, Director-Robert Mulligan, Supporting Actress-Mary Badham, Black and White cinematography, Original Score-Elmer Bernstein.Wins: Leading Actor-Gregory Peck, Screenplay Based on another Medium and Black and White Set Design.March Boy awards: Supporting Actor-James Anderson, Screenplay Based on Another Medium and Black and White cinematography.To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those movies where if you say an ill word about it people will gasp and say things like &#8220;Oh my goodness! You have no taste! That&#8217;s like criticizing the Mona Lisa or the Sistine Chapel! Go back to your CGI transformer flicks!&#8221; It is rated 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and there is not a single negative review on the critic page of the Internet Movie Database. For that reason I think it is a little overrated.It is beautifully shot and has a good score but a movie needs more than great photography and music. It needs great screenwriting (which is frankly excellent especially in the courtroom) but it also needs great acting and direction and that is what To Kill a Mockingbird lacks a lot of.Gregory Peck is a star I just can&#8217;t seem to warm up to. He was handsome and had a great speaking voice but I&#8217;ve never felt like he became the character. I&#8217;ve seen Gentleman&#8217;s Agreement, The Yearling and Roman Holiday and all these performances have a sameness to them. The same can be said about Atticus Finch. Peck is fairly good in the quieter scenes like when he&#8217;s talking to Scout and Jem but whenever a scene becomes tense or dramatic he never seems to loosen up. He has a habit of going into these self-conscious frowns and smiles and sometimes says his lines like he was sight reading the newspaper. Even his &#8220;In the name of God believe Tom Robinson&#8221; is as calm, cool and collected as if a rape case were the most ordinary thing of the day.The child actors got on my nerves too. They aren&#8217;t exactly bad but their whole demeanor struck me as a little too cute country bumpkin. John Megna as Dill is especially annoying; that whinny voice of his could peel paint.On the other hand, many of the supporting players are superb. Alice Ghostly and Ruth White are excellent as the cantankerous neighbors Stephanie Crawford and Mrs. Dubose. Brock Peters is great in his one little scene as Tom Robinson, (especially his line delivery of &#8220;I did not sir!&#8221;) Collin Wilcox Paxton (Mayella) plays eccentric and nervous like no other and James Anderson&#8217;s snarling, vicious Mr. Ewell should have received an Oscar nomination.Robert Mulligan&#8217;s direction ranges from average to not very good. For instance, there are plenty of moments where he could have shown close ups of the characters faces but instead shows their back from a distance. When Jem, Scout and Dill are all clustered at the courtroom door trying to get a view, they make a tower and stand Dill on the top. As he look in he says &#8220;There&#8217;s a colored man standing next to your daddy. There&#8217;s another man shouting at them.&#8221; But we only see the back of his head. Why couldn&#8217;t we see his reaction to the courtroom proceedings? Also after the trial, when Atticus comes home with the news Tom is dead he slumps against a rail and says &#8220;We had such a great chance. We had MORE than a chance.&#8221; Once again we see the back of his head instead of an effective close up of his face to see his expression&#8212;how he&#8217;s desperately struggling to keep all his inner tensions bottled up. However, I think the scene where the kids are sneaking into Mr. Radley&#8217;s yard was appropriately suspenseful (especially with Boo&#8217;s shadow) and the courtroom scene was good too.Make no mistake. To Kill a Mockingbird has a great story to work with&#8212;the father/son/daughter relationship is quite beautiful and Atticus is a parent everyone should strive to emulate. He knew in his heart he wasn&#8217;t going to win this case since he was defending a black man against a white jury in the South but he still stood up for what he sincerely believed was the truth. A movie with a storyline as great as To Kill a Mockingbird deserves to have devoted fans so if you love it, be fanatical by all means. I enjoyed it; I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as spectacularly done (technical-wise) as so many people give it credit. I wouldn&#8217;t call it an example of terrific filmmaking but I do think it&#8217;s worth watching nonetheless.	3.0	To Kill a Mockingbird is a little overrated but still good.	2013-12-16	3	1	2

The town is Maycomb.  It is in Alabama (not Georgia).  And the poor white woman's name is Mayella Ewell.As to the movie, I've seen it dozens of times since I was 6 and it is one of the few movies that can touch the hem of the garment of the book (though it did change a few things, and leave some parts out--for example, Tom Robinson was shot 17 times and not once in the leg, and he was shot trying to escape prison).  It is a beautiful movie, despite the ugliness and three of the best played scenes are when the black minister tells Jean Louise Finch (Scout) ""stand up.  Your father's passin'"".  The other is at the beginning when Atticus is on the porch listening to Scout ask Jem what their momma was like.  You could feel the pain on Atticus' face.  The third and most beautiful was when the adult actress voiced over for Scout at the end and said she thought of those childhood times often--of Boo, of Tom Robinson..and of Atticus; and though you weren't told, you just knew that Atticus had died by then.Also, I never felt that Mayella Ewell was evil.  Poor, deprived, ignorant and pathetic, but not evil.  In the book it was clear she had been molested by her father, who was definitely the villian in this tale.  All in all, a touching movie with great performances that has stood the test of time."	5.0	Please please-if you're going to review, check the credits	2004-09-08	4	4	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A129YBX5BVNW2	"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry"""	"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY VERSION ***In April 2012 Universal Studios is 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given re-launches across the year as well - each featuring distinctive ""100th Anniversary"" card-wrap packaging and in many cases a host of new features. Most (not all) of these re-issues will be two-disc sets containing the Blu Ray, the DVD and also means to obtain a Digital Copy via download.1962's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and an absolute peach it is too.Released 10 January 2012 - it comes in a gorgeous limited edition 'book pack' (Barcode 5050582881844). The outer hardback holder has a card-pouch wrapped around it at the base and a 45-page booklet contained within. The book has interviews with Veronique Peck (his wife of 40 plus years), Harper Lee (author of the 1960 novel), pictures of the Shooting Script, Original Storyboards, Original Posters and Lobby Cards (from around the world), Press Book Excerpts and even Correspondence surrounding the movie (telegrams of congratulations from Fred Astaire, Betty Bacall and Charlton Heston). It's a visual feast with loads of photos peppering the wonderful memorabilia. Universal are to be praised for this because it absolutely looks the part. But the real fireworks comes in the other two elements at play here - the extensive extras - and the glorious new print...Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results are BEAUTIFUL. Even from the opening logo and credits of a child drawing - there are no lines or scratches of any kind - and the black and white cinematography of 1930's Alabama is fantastically clear. Stand-out clarity - the scene where the accused black man Tom Robertson is sweating in the courtroom as he relays his side of the story (a superlative Brock Peters - he read the Eulogy at Peck's funeral in 2003 at Peck's request), Atticus's son Jem is in his dad's car outside the family home of the black Robertson family as the hateful Bob Ewell looks on, the three children watching from the bushes as the mob try to take the jail with Atticus guarding the doorway, Atticus explaining what happened to Tom Robertson after the trial as the moonlight shines on his suit, the young girl Scout pointing out the simpleton Boo Radley behind the bedroom door (Robert Duvall's stunning cinematic debut where he doesn't utter a word but leaves an indelible mark) - it's all suddenly gorgeous. And the sound is rounded and clean too. An exemplary job.The extras are equally superb - the centrepiece of which is a near one and half-hour documentary called ""A Conversation With..."" It's a feast for Peck fans - interviews with Barry Norman in 1974, Terry Wogan in 1979 and other notables throughout the years are peppered with home movies and footage of Peck giving a one-on-one show to a Virginia audience in 1999. It's a raconteur tour-de-force a la David Niven - an 83-year old Peck is generous, charming, witty, responsive - full of anecdotes about Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Harper Lee. We get stories about meeting his wife in Paris just before shooting for ""Roman Holiday"" began - there's footage of dinner with the President of France Jacques Chirac and his family - a visit to Niagara Falls with his daughter Cecilia (handshakes with an adoring public) - US President Bill Clinton giving Peck the National Medal Of Arts and dropping it! But most of all as the minutes pass by you 'get' why Gregory Peck was greeted with such staggering affection everywhere he went in the world - he literally exuded 'good guy' from his every pore - that old style Hollywood class - a talented giant who didn't have a mean bone in his body. It's joyful stuff to watch.The movie itself has entered into folklore - released in 1962 and filmed in Black and White - it primarily centres on a black man accused of raping a white woman and the trial that follows. Such was the power of the story - and especially Peck's central performance as the principled lawyer Atticus Finch (his only Oscar win) it literally inspired members of the public to take up the law as a profession and even impacted on America's turbulent and changing racial landscape of the time. The performances by the children as innocents are particularly superb too - but it's Peck who dominates the whole thing with a gravitas and sincerity that few actors could match. His stand against bigotry is magnificent and filled with a quiet decency that has touched audiences for decades. As if sensing the importance of the part, Peck's scrawl is all over the shooting script - to the point that it often obliterates the text - the four words he scribbled on the last page describing the character he plays title this review - and describe the great man himself.To sum up - with the 1930 anti-war masterpiece ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" also being amongst the first vanguard of these 'restored' releases - it's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of its movie legacy - and be proud about doing so too. I for one will collect the whole series - and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.An absolutely first-class release - and then some.BLU RAY Specifications:EXTRAS:1.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AKX28FGA6L47J	Mark	"This is probably my very favorite movie - the one film that I would have to have if I was stranded on a desert island that, fortunately, had electric outlets, a televison and a DVD / VCR.In a time when we've all become accustomed to these panoramic epics which command a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars and seek to spell bind the audience with breath taking special effects, To Kill A Mockingbird succeeds without having to resort to any of these.This movie, filmed appropriately in black and white, tells the simple story of Atticus Finch, an attorney in the south of the 1930's who is raising his two children, Scout and Jeb. The story is seen through the eyes of Scout, a young girl, who is narrating the story many years later as a grown woman. And this is one of the important elements of this film. To Kill A Mockingbird is seen from a child's perspective and, as such, men like Atticus and the poor black man charged with the crime, Tom Robinson are seen as very honourable men (which is what they were.!!) almost wearing white hats while the evil people in the movie - the woman wrongfull accusing Tom of rape and her white, trailer trash father - are thoroughly despicable individuals more to be pitied than to be hated.The movie's focal point - and it certainly was a very powerful one in 1963 when this movie was made - concerned Atticus Finch's defense of a black man who had wrongfully been charged with the sexual assault of a white woman, a crime in the 1930's south that usually bypassed the courts entriely and went directly to the nearest tree which had a limb big enough to throw a noose over.This movie, of course, addresses racism and it must have opened alot of eyes in the 1960's when it was made in terms of addressing the progress, or lack thereof, that had been made in the intervening 30 years.But more than that, it was very much a movie about growing up and how we saw the world and our parent(s) and adults and good and evil. The conclusions we came to and how the events of our youth shaped our lives and made us the people that we are today. It showed us, for example, that the boogey man ""Boo Radley""- wonderfully played by a young Robert Duval - was not so scary when you understood the real ""boogeyman"" was the flesh and blood father of the woman who cried rape.Needless to say, Gregory Peck, who won the Best Actor award for his incredible performance of the decent Atticus Finch, was riveting. In a very low key and understated way, Atticus quietly exemplified all of the best qualities an individual could possess - honour, honesty, self-respect.This wonderful movie was based on Harper Lee's best selling Pulitzer prize winning novel. Surprisingly, Harper Lee never published anything more of significance after this book. In retrospect, how could you possibly follow up ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". I think it would have been comparable to following the Beatles after their initial Ed Sullivan appearance.This movie is one of those rare adaptations that actually adhered exclusively to the book and, as a result, was an artistic and commercial success. It's rare for a movie to ever approach the book in terms of quality (look at the movies based on Tom Clancey novels..!!).Another wonderful contribution to this film was the soundtrack. The almost haunting quality of the music, coupled with the black and white cinematography, created a wonderful mood - both during the film's ligher moments as well as the terrifying moments(as seen through the child's perspective). It's a beautiful soundtrack and certainly merits inclusion in your collection.This movie had a significant and lasting impact on me as an 11 year old seeing it for the first time. And many yearslater, it can still convey the same feelings in me that I felt back then. There's a very good reason why the book is considered mandatory reading in many American schools.If you're a lover of great films, then this movie is essential viewing.!"	5.0	A Timeless Story For Everybody..	2004-08-24	9	9	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"Harper Lee wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about memories she made growing up in small town Alabama during that time between the Civil War and World War II, when blacks had been emancipated, but many whites, especially in the South, were reluctant to acknowledge blacks as equals.  The setting of this story preceded Martin Luther King, Jr's work by two decades. The novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the most important, passionate, beloved, spiritual and moral works in the English language.  It rightfully was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and if only one had been awarded for the entire 20th century, it would still get my vote.Rightfully so, Harper Lee was hesitant to see her beloved story turned over to ""Hollywood"".  She needn't have worried.""To Kill a Mockingbird"", the film, has become as beloved as Harper Lee's book.  When the American Film Institute came out with their many ""100 Greatest..."" lists at the turn of the century Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch came out at #1 on the list of ""Greatest Screen Heroes"", ahead of such screen icons as Indiana Jones, James Bond and Rick from ""Casablanca"".  The film itself ranked as #34 of Greatest Films of history.  I would personally rank it in the top 2.The story is relatively simple.  A black man, Tom Robinson (in a noble performance by Brock Peters) is accused of raping a young woman from a ""white trash"" family.  The guilt of the black man is a foregone conclusion in this predominantly white southern town, but the Judge knows the only man in town with a chance to defend Tom.  The Judge asks Atticus Finch.  Atticus Finch is a widower, raising his two children on the salary of a small-town southern lawyer, frequently taking livestock and vegetables in trade for his services.  Atticus has many friends in town, and everyone who knows Mr. Finch knows that he is a man of saint-like honor.  Atticus never brags and much of what his own children learn about him comes from other adults who have known him for years.Wisely approaching the movie from the same perspective as Harper Lee's original narrative, Robert Mulligan tells the story from the perspective of the Finch children: Mary Badham as daughter Scout (who seems about 10) and slightly older brother Phillip Alford as Jem.  Scout and Jem do the things that children do.  They play hide and seek.  They tell ghost stories.  They roll tires down the street.  And, most importantly, they watch their father defend an innocent man who is sometimes an inch away from being lynched.The courtroom scenes are taut, with racial conflict simmering away like a pot threatening to boil over at any moment.  Atticus Finch keeps the lid on that pot.  The courtroom scenes here have not been matched by any film before or since.  Gregory Peck confided to Director Mulligan that he had won the Academy Award for him in just the scene at the end of the trial where Atticus silently packs up his papers and walks out of the courtroom.  If you haven't seen the film before - watch for this moment and you'll know what he meant.Supporting performances perfectly compliment the transcendant one by Mr. Peck.  Robert Duvall makes an impressive screen debut in an important role that doesn't appear until the final moments.  Collin Wilcox Paxton captures the pitiful ""victim"" of the alleged rape, Mayella Ewell.  James Anderson is terrifying as Mayella's spitefully prejudiced father, Bob Ewell.  Estelle Evans plays Calpurnia, who mothers the motherless Finch children when Atticus must be away.  Frank Overton is authoritative and one of the only professional friends Atticus has as Sheriff Tate.  Paul Fix presides over the famous courtroom scenes, in addition to asking Atticus to carry the unbearable load of defending the case that can't be defended in that town at that time.In America (and, dare I say, other parts of the world) issues of prejudice and racism have not completely subsided.  But the days of Emmitt Till seem long ago and far away.  It took something to change the minds or racist Southerners not that many generations away from slavery.  ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" has done as much to advance the principles of fairness and justice as any single work of history.  It's that important."	5.0	One of the greatest Treasures in film	2005-12-06	3	3	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1RDQWI6E5DHEI	"Mark Vandergaard ""Looking at Roots"""	This film is a great film that records the strained and alienating relations of a dominant white society against African Americans in the 50s and the right for a trial and a plea for justice. Gregory Peck plays a white lawyer defending an African American who is wrongly accused of raping a white woman. While this film ends sadly, it nevertheless reminds us that injustice still exists today whether you are Mexican, Middle Eastern, or any other ethnic group that has suffered from the powers of white racism.	5.0	A Classic that will never get old	2013-04-14	0	0	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A258YDD6553JA2	Mary F. Sibley	Every so often, as surely as night follows day, a film comes along that manages to transport us from our everyday lives and into a time and place that is recalled through memories of better and in a reversal of fortunes, turbulent times. To Kill A Mockingbird is such a film.In a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, the small town of Macomb, Alabama is portrayed in the summer of 1932, during the deepest depression that the United States had ever experienced. Over the course of the next year and a half, events will burrow inside this sleepy southern town and the lives of its residents will be transported by actions, ideas, perceptions and convictions that will influence one and all in ways that will ring true for years to come.Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and widower, raising two small children, Scout (Mary Badham) and her older brother Jem (Phillip Alford). Into their lives enters a visitor, Dill (John Megna) from Meridian, Mississippi, come to spend two weeks with his Aunt Stephanie (Alice Ghostley). Macomb is a town with nothing to do and if there were, no money to spend on it. The stage is being set for a life shattering episode that will not go quietly into that good night.Childhood holds its fascinations, its myths, its coming of age and through the eyes of the three children, the audience is allowed to peer into the adult world around them as perceived through the minds and souls of innocence that will be all too easily shattered as time whistles down the track. One of the stories woven so masterfully within its covers is the local urban legend of bogeyman, Boo Radley (Robert Duval), who lives on the same block as the Finch family. In a narration, rather like playing telephone, his persona takes on all the familiar attributes of a raving lunatic, a monster out for blood. His aura becomes the end all for Scout, Jem and Dill as they seek to master the mystery surrounding Boo and the ability to live to tell the tale!Into this world of innocence, a shattering crescendo of complexity wraps itself in the lives of the townspeople in the form of an alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Violet Ewell (Collin Wilcox) by a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). Atticus Finch is called upon to act as counsel for Robinson and in doing so, the stage has been set for a dance with race relations and the exemplary lengths that are gone to in order to allow justice to prevail in the face of malcontent.The performances throughout To Kill A Mockingbird are stunning. Gregory Peck, as the gentleman lawyer, mired in small town attitudes and thoughts that were so representational in the southern gothic sphere, has collected and held a restrained order to his character, and in the process, he has allowed us all to be on the receiving end of hate as conveyed through the actions of small minds and small people. The children, especially Mary Badham, are siblings of more than a movie making venture. They show the absence of preconceived notions, and the guile of beings before the actions of adults can render their world as lost and gone with the shedding of time.James Anderson as Tom Ewell is the complete representation of oily slime as Mayella's father. He embodies all of the hate and prejudice that continues to be harboured to this day in the souls of those who would attempt to wield their vision of the way things should and ought to be. He has a foul baseness that lingers like a bad rash as he attempts to invoke his arguments through drunken bullying and hatred. Collin Willcox as Mayella is excruciatingly convincing as the bored, housebound white woman who tries to tempt Tom Robinson into kissing her and through her actions sets in motion a rollercoaster of tragedy to come. Her speech to the assembled courtroom is superb and as the audience, you feel her anger and resentment at having to be put in such a position, having to lie to save face and what little position she has in the town. Brock Peters as the aforementioned Robinson is equally sure in the allotted time he spends on the screen. There is a noble demeanor to his bearing, and yet we are aware of the restrictions that blacks were held to in their relationships with whites at the time.Robert Mulligan, the director and Horton Foote, the screenwriter, have presented us with a look into our pasts and faithfully etched a portrait of quiet and artfully rendered proportions that draw us into the canvas and the lives of those assembled. We have walked a mile in their shoes and been under their skin. Foote worried about being able to do justice to Lee's novel, but he worried for nothing. He has completely evoked an era that now rests behind clouds of dust, blown by the winds of time into oblivion.The cinematography by Russell Harlan and the set decoration by Oliver Emert carry us back through the courtesy of black and white to a depiction seen only in old photographs and clouding memories of those who lived in those precarious times. Black and white films seem to have had a curse thrust upon them by the younger generation today, as boring and tedious, but through the courtesies extended by Harlan and Emert, we are richer for those perceptions that would harken back throughout the pages of history.Elmer Bernstein's film score carries us like an old friend and helps us to make our acquaintances with the characters held within this framework. He has achieved much with a simple theme and persuades us that said simplicity is fulfilled with less rather than more.To Kill A Mockingbird is beautifully haunting and having been made in the 60's, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, it garners our attention to stop and take the time to truly 'see' what the human race is all about and what it can and should be, if taken over the bumps in the road and onto a path of sincere honesty and purpose. No special effects were needed, no huge Hollywood budget, no splashing of a story that had a happy ending for everyone involved. It is an open book into the realities of a world tilting temporarily off its axis, and being brought back on track through the goodness that sits in the hearts, minds and souls of mankind, if given half a chance.See it and be amazed at what real moviemaking is all about.	5.0	The Summer We Discovered Life	2004-01-21	9	9	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A35XMSURGM0L1N	M. Buisman	'To Kill A Mockingbird' is of course the movie adaptation of Harper Lee's movie with the same title. Gregory Peck is a lawyer in rural Mississippi who is asked to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.The movie starts however with a seemingly unrelated event, the lives of Atticus Finch's two children. His daughter is a tomboy and his son is trying to keep her from getting into more trouble. The stumble upon some strange items and look at the house of a strange man called Boo Radley.Then the movie goes into the court case. It is of course very obvious that the black man is innocent, but this is 1930's South with an all white jury...Then the two parts of the movie come back together again...The acting in this movie (in black and white) is superb. I recall that Gregory Pecks perfomance was voted the best of the century. Even the little girl is superb, she even got a nominatation for an oscar. Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall, though he says next to nothing and is only in the movie for a few minutes. He of course 10 years later would play Tom Hayden in The Godfather.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1TPAG6HM8EN8L	"Melanie N. Lee ""mnl_1221"""	"This past winter (2010), after losing a job and having very little money, I was driven to watch my VHS of To Kill a Mockingbird over and over again.  Yesterday (5/5/10) I finished the novel, and I wrote a separate review of that.  Here in this review of the film, I want to concentrate on two things: the images of fathers, and the music.As I kept viewing the film, I noticed that except for Atticus Finch, practically every father in the film is either absent or abusive.  Boo Radley's father cuts him off from the world; Bob Ewell gets drunk and beats his child, and doesn't stop there; Dill Harris' father has apparently abandoned him: after saying he ""hasn't got a father"" but he's ""not dead"", Dill then says his dad let him drive a railroad and one day will swoop him away on an airplane.  Even Tom Robinson, a hard-working Black man with a wife and children, is forced to abandon his family.  Probably Walter Cunningham Sr. does is best, but he is dirt-poor, and can't rise above the prejudices of his society without help.In contrast, Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), is kind, patient, analytical, discreet, approachable, humble, and courageous, providing an excellent example for his children.  Because he's not a macho man--he refuses to play football for the Methodists because he's too old--his children at first don't think he's much to be proud of, but boy do they learn!The other thing I want to mention is the music, written by Elmer Bernstein (no relation to Leonard Bernstein, though they were friends).  The main theme, played on flute, violins, then piano, is a haunting melody which probably speaks to the innocence of childhood and nostalgia for that innocence.  The theme plays over and over again in my mind, speaking things to the emotions that words just cannot say.  Elmer Bernstein won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and was nominated for an Oscar.This film has a great story, great characters, great performances, and a great mood.

I have taught this book in my class for over 15 years. Each time I see the movie, I am reminded of how this book echoed through the minds of readers and  publishers when it was published in 1960. Then, something magical happened.  A movie. This movie steals the very heart and soul of every human being  that watches it. I can still see the moist eyes and cheeks of my students  as they exit my classes. This movie is a timeless classic that will never  die. Please, make yourself feel good, and purchase this movie- or even rent  it for a night. You will never forget it.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1	Melissa	I loved this DVD and movie in general. I loved the book when they made us read it about in Middle School. Since it's been ages since I've seen or read either I needed to get this video and I recieved it as a wonderful gift for Christmas. Though, it took me a while to watch it. When I did watch it however, it really does make you think back to those times. And some things I didn't even catch when I was younger that I do as an adult. The story is told by a grown up Scout who was rather a Tom Boy. Her and her brother growing up with their father who's a lawyer. The story intellengently touches on perhapes three stories in one. One story is of the family in general, the second one is the story of the kids wanting to know about their neighbor Boo Bradley. The third and most thought provoking and sometimes hard to watch because of it being so dramatic is where the father defends a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. That scene in general was outstanding. It's easy to see that Gregory Peck won an academy award for best actor. The movie makes you want to read the book, which does give more detail. However, the great thing about this movie is not for the actor's but the fact that it really does follow the book.As for the DVD it's self it was a pleasure to navigate around. Has a wonderful information on production notes. And the idea of an author (Harper Lee) loving a Screen Play is quite unknown so that just tells you how much this movie is loved. The only thing is that the sound was rather hard to hear, however I haven't been able to find a DVD or Video yet that had good sound with this movie. It's still worth the buy you won't be sorry, the picture is great for a black and white film and it's fun re-watching a child's adventure in the times of a depression. I recommend this movie for anyone who's old enough to understand this film, and I garentee after you watch the movie you'll want to read the book. I wanted to re-read the book after I saw the movie again :)	5.0	Wonderful and Thoughtful Story	2002-01-09	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3S1HAQDAFM6FD	M. Eugeni	To Kill a Mockingbird is immensely simple, echoing the languid mood of a small town, pre-television, pre-suburban isolation, and very much in the midst of ignorance and prejudice. Main character is Scout, a child growing up with older brother Jem who longs for manhood and her father Atticus Finch, a uniquely dedicated lawyer and good man. Racism is the issue that stands out in the end, but TKAM is more an exploration of a time and place that most of us will never--and might never hope to--know. What action exists is observed by a mysterious neighbor and the stoic dad. Don't be fooled by the slow pace; there are myriad joys and hopes to be found in this film.Collector's Edition DVD includes Fearful Symmetry, a wonderfully illuminating documentary about the making of the film and the basis for its story and characters. It starts slow but the messages (some rathy wordy) are poignant. Narration includes many quotes from the book, details that are left out of the movie in effort to translate to screen. For anyone unsure of the value of movie and its story, this feature-length documentary is a wonderful introduction or alternative.	4.0	Absorbing classic about racism and family	2004-05-13	8	5	3

To complement our discussion, we rented this film, which led to a second discussion about filmmaking and the whole &quot;the book was better than the movie&quot; conundrum.One thing on which we all agreed was that the movie is a gem. My son also noted the following:After our book dissusion, we saw the movie To Kill a Mockingbird. Through it, I learned that moviemakers condense characters so they don't have to introduce a large cast. For example, in the novel, Dill's aunt is actually Mrs.Rachel, but in the movie, the characters of  Mrs. Stephanie and Mrs. Rachel are combined. The Finch's large extended family is missing from the film, as are Scout's teachers and classmates. I also learned that a filmmaker may also have a different vision of a book's characters. My mental picture of the characters included Scout as a small girl with freckles and pigtails and Calpurnia as a pudgy old woman in glasses. The actors who portrayed them in the film differed greatly from what I imagined.	5.0	Great film!	2001-04-01	3	2	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AY3EENC2BGTGK	"M. G. Gagliano ""Maria"""	"The 411 by Maria:Unlike a lot of my friends, I don't recall having to read this book in school but then again, that was a long time ago. If I am going to watch or read something, I don't like to read the synopsis so I had no idea what the movie was about when I started.The movie is set in the 1930's and focus on Atticus Finch played magnificently by Gregory Peck and his two children, Jem and Scout (more on them later). Atticus is a respected attorney who has been commissioned to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a woman in her own home.What I Can Tell You:Wow, where do I start. I was completely floored with this movie. Gregory Peck performance is completely stunning! The fact that he won best actor for the role was not lost on me, completely worthy of it and one of the best acting I have ever seen. However, after seeing some of the bonus features, I believe he was pretty much playing himself!  A gentle, kind soul, whose thoughtfulness and mannerisms bring out the best in those around him. He allows, after a gentle nudge to make their own assumptions and mistakes in life in hopes of becoming a better person.The actress who played Scout was unbelievably ""real"". You would never believe that this child was not Gregory Peck's daughter. There is real love there and I was n awe of how much acting had to be done. Most emotions were seen not heard. Without the use of a soundtrack and a whole lot of dialogue these actors really have to ACT! You can hear everything. The actors are not bogged down with dialogue, the scene is set, and you act!The quietness of the whole movie is really what got me. When I discussed it with people after watching, those who have seen or have not, that was what I mentioned most. I appreciated the quietness. For such a sensitive subject matter, I felt that if this was being done today, the deepness of it would be lost in translation.I have so many favorite scenes:Scout saying goodnight to her father and asking what he has to pass on to her when he is gone.Brock Peters taking the stand. His emotion was so real!Atticus speaking to his children. He is such a gentle, caring man who obviously loves his children.Scout and Jem's relationship. Anytime they were on the screen I was in love.Scout talking to the gang who headed to the jail to take the law in their own hands. Her innocence was palpable.Scout talking to Boo Radley after he helped her and her brother.If you do get the Blu-ray, take time to watch the bonus features. Truly a blessing to have this footage. Well worth your time.To Kill a Mockingbird won Academy Awards for Best Actor (Peck), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Art Direction. Truly a classic and one that everyone should watch.  This is when acting was actually acting. No green screens, no classy soundtracks, no glamorous special effects, just acting at its finest."	5.0	Timeless Classic!	2012-01-30	5	3	2

Within five minutes, one can see why Horton Foote's awesome screenplay won an Oscar, and why Gregory Peck won his only Oscar for his role as Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham, Philip Alford and John Megna as the children are priceless; Robert Duvall in a small but pivotal role is magnificent; Colin Wilcox as the so-called rape victim gives a dynamic performance, as does Brock Peters as the accused.  Estelle Evans as Calpurnia, the housekeeper, evokes the warmth and maternal kindness of a caring housekeeper, and Frank Overton as the sheriff has a fine moment in the end of the movie.  Not a weak performance in the cast.  Beautifully directed by Robert Mulligan with a fine score from Elmer Bernstein, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD remains a powerful and affectionate cinematic treat.	5.0	AN AMERICAN CLASSIC	2004-10-31	10	6	4

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2PTL3QI1NIYGS	"Michael G. King ""skyyking"""	I can't write about Harper Lee's novel, the Pulitzer Prize, the Ocsar nominations from this film, or any of the other big worded babble I see in many other reviews. I can only write about my own simple feelings, so here goes:I first saw TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD along about 1975 on late night TV. I was about twelve years old at the time. My parents had just bought a farm in the country and they spent a lot of time there. I was allowed to stay home in the city alone. Well, sort of alone, my grandmother lived right next door and kept a watchful eye over me. Never the less, this was my chance to watch the old movies they played on late night TV.I was completely into this movie. I couldn't get up from the floor where I was sitting in front of the television set. No small feat to accomplish with a twelve year old boy. At the time, I was only a couple of years older than the character Gem, Atticus Finch's ten year old son. This movie, on this night in 1975, changed my view of life forever.My father, born and raised in the time this film occurs, was very opinionated of those who were of a different race. He had no use for violent racism whatsoever, but Atticus Finch he wasn't either. While I loved my father dearly, this film helped me understand that he wasn't always right. The film also made me understand that remarks and opinions weren't always just about race. Sometimes, as with Boo Radley, they were about the people down the street, be they different in any way. My father was guilty of this sin too. Again, I learned that all of his opinions did not have to become mine.White, Black, Comfortable, Poor, Smart, Slow, Good, Evil, Fun, Serious, Laughter, Fear. All the elements are here, as seen through the eyes of children. Sometimes, we know not what we do to our children because of the way they see things. This film awakens us to that fact. All of these lessons taught in a film of kids having fun. Oh man, I wish they still made tires big enough to ride inside of.Crayons, marbles, pocket watches, oh the simplicity of what is fun in children's eyes. Despite our present day culture of buying loads of manufactured toys and games, most young children would just as soon throw out the toys and play with the boxes. Mason jars, hot summer evenings, and fireflies are also more fun than any amount of money can buy.I had spent years looking for a VHS copy of this movie, and finally found this version....I went and purchased the Wide Screen Edition immediately. I find myself popping this in, late at night, and reliving the experience I had at twelve. It happens every time, I have to stop whatever else I may be doing and watch attentively.I play this for my six year old son every chance I get. I too, think that this is required viewing for children six through twelve. I really believe he'll learn something about life, and will have fun doing it. It also gives me ideas, like finding the largest motorcycle tire I could find and tying it up with rope to our maple tree in the front yard, making a swing out of it. And despite what my neighbors may think, believing it right to do so. How about going to a yardsale and buying an old scratched up toy car for less than a buck and placing it in a tree knothole for him to find. There is no way to measure the level of excitement, and that scratched up old toy car becomes his favorite toy. Even Christmas can't compare, because he knows it's comming.Repeated viewings of this film makes me a better father. It makes me remember to think like a six year old again. So what if the boys create a dirt figure 8 track for their toy cars right in the front yard. If the neighbors don't like it, maybe they should move.

Edelman	True to the novel from which it was drawn, this movie combines a number of stellar performances from a tremendously talented cast to produce what I think of as the quintessential American film. The issues it deals with are the big ones- love, death, growing up and racism- and it views them through the clear eyes of a young child. I've been watching this film at least once a year since I was a child. It still never fails to move me.	5.0	The greatest American movie ever made	2001-06-25	1	1	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3N8WAQZVOAO8G	Michael Matthews	The film, truly an American classic and, for my money, one of the 10 best American films ever made, is splendidly rendered here with a mint-condition print. The DVD also offers a superb mix of additional features, most  especially the remarkable documentary on the film, &quot;Fearful  Symmetry,&quot; by Charles Kiselyak, and compelling yet unassuming  commentary by the director, Robert Mulligan, and the producer, the late  Alan J. Pakula.Besides interviews with Mulligan and Pakula, the  documentary includes interviews with the actors who play the children, Mary  Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem, as well as with the screen  writer, Horton Foote, and the composer, Elmer Bernstein.  The documentary  also includes interviews with several residents of Monroeville, Ala., the  real Macon, to round out a sense of  &quot;Macon&quot; then and  now.Among the revelations in the commentary is that production designer  Henry Bumstead (Vertigo) masterfully recreated the children's neighborhood  on the Universal backlot using houses that would have been demolished by  the construction of a freeway. The main titles, by Stephen Frankfurt, with  Bernstein's theme, manage brilliantly to capture not only the essense of  the film but an essence of childhood, about which both Harper Lee's  timeless only published novel and the film itself are very much about. Only  later do we discover the nature of that blend of innocence and experience  alluded to in the William Blake poem from which Kiselyak takes the title of  his documentary.My only regret is that Harper Lee, though she helped  Kiselyak in producing the documetnary, declined to be interviewed for it.  In its stead, however, we have another evocation, that of Ms. Lee's voice  in the rich tone of nostalgia and reminiscence with which Kiselyak infuses  his own small but mighty masterpiece.	5.0	An American classic classically rended in DVD	2000-06-05	125	119	6

Injustice, racism and cruelty and one man who stands up with the courage to defy it. It is a wonderful story of a little girl growing up in a very grown up world.

I found it very touching, owing to all the performances of the actors, particularly that of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.

The documentary on their restoration process is awesome! Just wished it was more detailed, but they get their message across. There are tons of extras to enjoy on this blu ray.

It is one of the rare instances where the movie is almost as good as the book, written by Harper Lee.This is the Legacy Series edition of this movie and contains additional features for ardent fans of this incredible work. Contained here, along with the movie on disc one, are Gregory Peck's Academy Award acceptance speech for best actor, his remarks from the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, an excerpt from the Academy's tribute to Gregory Peck, an interview with Mary Badham (Scout), feature commentary from the Director and Producer and the theatrical trailer.Disc two includes a well produced documentary titled ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" where Peck reminisces his stellar career and interacts with audiences and past co-stars. Here Peck's somewhat controversial social activism is touched on, which may be a turn off to some as he was a staunch and vocal advocate of gun control, withdrawal from Viet Nam and other activist issues of that age. This disc also includes the making of the movie, which is an exceptional feature.Also included in the Legacy Series edition are eleven matted reproductions of original theatrical posters, which would be suitable for framing for collectors of such memorabilia. This is all housed in a sturdy and attractive book-type case. If you don't already own this movie, I highly recommend this edition."	5.0	Additional features to a classic.	2006-05-21	30	15	15

Watching this film has something of the opposite impact--it makes one appreciate the depth of talent displayed and that writers, directors, and actors actually had to rely on the storyline and acting for films to succeed. This is one that did and does.Some of the ""special features"" drag a bit, but it is interesting to hear Gregory Peck talk about the film and to experience his wit and humor. Again, ""behind the scenes"" isn't about how things get blown up or car crashes are staged. It's about the heart and soul of the film, the characters and the actors who portrayed them.In a word, ""Recommended.""While some kids might groan at the black and white images and lack of ""action,"" it's good family viewing.

The uppermost of the three panels in the otherwise solid doors is now clear glass besides the transom.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A25ZVIPQV9CKAU	NYYanksFan	"I remember several years back watching one of those AFI ""Top 100"" shows, this time relating to the top 100 heroes and villains in film history.  It was easy to predict that Hannibal Lecter would be the top villain.  But as the countdown progressed, I wondered who would be the top hero.  My personal film hero has always been Atticus Finch, but as the Superman and Indiana Jones characters were being named in the final few slots, I didn't think the AFI voters would agree with me.  I was genuinely surprised, and very, very pleased, that the top film hero named was, indeed, Atticus Finch.I then started to think why it was I considered this character a hero, because certainly in Atticus Finch's mind, he wasn't doing ""heroic"" things.  He defended Tom Robinson not to be looked upon as saintly or holier than thou, but because he wanted to set a good example for his children -- and, very simply, he thought it was the right thing to do.  I think Atticus Finch's quiet devotion to his children, and his belief in doing what was decent and right in his life and profession, made this character a hero in my eyes.  As an attorney, I think often of Gregory Peck's summation in the film when I'm preparing for a trial.  I always find it inspiring.This is a film I revisit at least once a year, and it never ceases to move and inspire me.  Harper Lee must have been so proud."	5.0	Heroes	2008-01-28	6	6	0

What I will say is this particular packaging of the Movie, was a wonderful bonus, and has increased my appreciation of the movie two fold.  The bonus disc gave me an insight into Gregory Peck , whom I knew little about.  Like wise the interview with Mary Badham (who played Scout), provided me with additional enjoyment.  I watched this over the weekend with my three year old son Jacob, kids today don't go out of their way to watch anything in B&W, but such is the power of this movie, that he sat wide eyed waiting for the final arrival of Boo Radley.  Whom he calls ""Boo Wadderwee"". I watched the same reaction in him, that I had all those years ago when I first saw Robert Duvall behind that door, the hairs even today, still stand on end!

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1T7OVMIIDQQ0V	Patricia R. Schneider	One of my favorite, all-time movies, that embodies the innocence of childhood, the grace of Southern Charm, and the horrors of racism as we follow three children, two whose father has been assigned to defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young, white woman. It's a story of dignity as Atticus Finch, an honest God-fearing man and father, takes seriously his role to prove the accused as being innocent, and the respect with which he treats the accused and his family.In the meantime, we follow the lives of the three children during one summer, one who is a summer visitor and based on the life of Truman Capote, who was a neighbor of the story's author Harper Lee. The big mystery for the children is, who lives in the big, old scary house down the block? Their goal in life that summer is to find out who lives there. Most of us who grew up in the era where we had a lot of freedom to play outside and didn't have any fear about it will not only relate to the things those kids get into, but the horror that one hateful,white racist tries to do to Atticus through his children.Even though this is seen through the eyes of children, I wouldn't recommend it for children, especially young children---it could cause nightmares. Gregory Peck's finest role.	5.0	Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!	2013-07-04	0	0	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ACAE6O42VX2BQ	Patrik Lemberg	"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is at the time of my writing this ranked at #41 on IMDb's top 250 list (of movies of all time.)I haven't read Harper Lee's price-winning novel on which the movie is based, but watching the movie today (my second time in a year) reminded me of how much I wanted to experience the original story, in print, in addition to the film.Gregory Peck, who'd started working on Broadway and in movies 20 years prior to this film, does a very stable and critically acclaimed (Oscar rewarded) performance as Atticus Finch - a small town lawyer who, in 1930's Southern America, is defending a colored man (accused for rape by a white woman) in court.Much of this 1962 B&W; movie, which incidentally includes Robert Duvall's film-debut, is played out through the eyes of Finch's motherless children, ""Jem"" and ""Scout.""I recommend it highly to anybody anywhere, regardless of age and culture, as it contains no ""foul language"" or ""severe violence."" Sure - the story might not be very accessible to a five year old, but the content of the movie is not bound to hurt anyone. For all the viewer is aware, this could be a recreation of actual historic events, which it in a sense is.The music, composed by Elmer Bernstein, undoubtedly suites the picture and partly reminds me of musical elements (harmonically and in instrumentation) from harp-dominated 1950's Ingmar Bergman pictures (such as ""Smiles of a Summer Night."")Though probably not within the incoming year or two, I'm sure I'm going to watch this movie again.The well-restored sound and (widescreen) picture of this DVD features an insightful 90 minute long ""making of"" documentary as well as a theatrical trailer and biographies over the movie's main actors. There are also Spanish subtitles and a French audio track.For a regular film-lover to leave this classic unwatched would be like killing a mockingbird.OBSERVE: This review, which I wrote in March 2005, was not for the gold cover Collector's Edition, for which the review currently appears!"	5.0	Acknowledged masterpiece	2005-03-09	5	5	0

It is an excellent adaptation of Harper Lee's book.  Gregory Peck IS Atticus Finch.  A lawyer in a small Southern town, he's approached after dark to represent a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Although in that time and place a trial would just be a formality, Atticus Finch (played impeccibly by Gregory Peck) agrees to represent the defendant.  As a sub-plot, Finch's children amuse themselves in the pre-television era.  There are the endearing interactions between Atticus and his children.  In a dinner-time conversation, Atticus explains that when he got a shotgun as a child, he was told he could shoot any bird but that it was a sin to kill a mockingbird (and thereby explains the title of the book).  Harper Lee portrays small town life during the depression with great detail and the movie brings this out.  Any remake of the film would be simply superfluous.	5.0	An excellent adaptation of Harper Lee's book	2010-12-24	0	0	0

It's truly difficult to find fault in such an emotional, gripping, and touching story. The acting is fantastic (including some of the most natural child performances you've ever likely to see), the score is magnificent, and the film is very well-made.As part of Universal's 100th Anniversary, To Kill a Mockingbird has been given an all new restoration. The result is breathtaking. This is one of the clearest and most beautiful transfers for a film of this age I've seen. The sound, while slightly held back due to this being a 50-year old movie, also fares very well.This release is packed many worthwhile and insightful extras, particularly a feature-length documentary and commentary.A timeless masterpiece earns an equally impressive blu-ray release.	5.0	Early contender for blu-ray of the year	2012-08-22	0	0	0

Not purposely, but simply because life got in the way--raising a family, working two jobs, dealing with setbacks and disappointment, trying always to rise above the roadblocks, to make it all worthwhile, and even have some fun, along the way. There were years when my passion for reading took a back seat to being a wife, a mom, a part of the work force that keeps society moving, money in the bank account. Reading never stopped, but time became a luxury I often had to steal for an occasional book. Today, when I might have three books going at once, plus all the internet information I can devour, bliss is mine. Now, as I read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm beyond sad that this feast was denied me so long. Given the current, woeful state of the world, of national politics, reading this book has provided me a deeper well of comprehension of racial realities of which I was aware, certainly, which offended me, throughout my life. But this small jewel of a book has cracked my mind open in a way nothing else ever has, driving home again the immense power of books to reveal, to define reality clearly, in yet another light. I will be giving this book as gifts for a very long time.	5.0	To Kill a Mockingbord	2009-09-14	0	0	0

The great movie carefully preserved and restored with bonus materials.  There is little deviation from the book and the cast are great.  Centered around a girl and her family during the trial in a southern town of a black man accused of a crime by a white family.  The trial however is only one part of the story and the story of growing up as a child shares the focus.	5.0	Re-released and issued in an aniversary edition.	2013-02-06	0	0	0

I really enjoyed the movie;  it showed how the kids and the adults could really get along and not worry about ""the race stuff""! (I especially loved how the kids sat with the African-American townspeople in the court house upper level and it wasn't ""wrong"") The story of how a African American was accused of a Caucasion woman's rape, was the main focus of the plot. The man was put on trial and sentenced. Gregory Peck was the man's lawyer and really his ""advocate"" for justice! In the end,there was a second death;  the sherriff was called in, and  wanted the possible ""murder""(it was really self defense in my book), to be forgotten or put on the books as an accident....sooo after all the pain and tribulation,  he had changed and wanted people to come together, to forget their differences and to ""get along""!

I was around the same age as the kids in the movie.  Even though the movie was set in the South, I felt a connection with these characters because my pre-video game/VCR life was much like theirs.  We made our own adventures.  So the connection was very intense.  I immediately bought the book and read it cover to cover on my own and I loved the book even more.  I was not forced to see it or forced to see the movie in a classroom like the students in the school I used to teach at.  I did all of this willingly.  When the 2 disk anniversary version of this movie was advertised on Amazon.com, I jumped at the chance to own the ultimate edition of this movie.  I think I bought it more for the extra features than the original movie since I had already seen it multiple times.  I was not disappointed.  The Special Features were tremendous.  To think that a movie that was so endearing and social relevant was actually filmed on the back lot of Universal Studios and was so ""movie fake"" was so good on the screen all  bound together by one of the best movie sound tracks ever written is a testament to the creators of this motion picture.  It is a classic.  For anyone who wants a nostalgic evening of magic movie making with documentaries, commentaries, behind the scenes, what they look like now, etc. etc.  Immediately buy, borrow, or rent this classic motion picture that I grew up with and now have my own copy thanks to the magic of ownership of the DVD."	5.0	To Kill a Mockingbird	2005-10-18	1	1	0

For some reason, I had not gotten to it, and that seemed like an oversight. I really enjoyed reading Harper Lee's book; I also read about her life and about the filming of &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34;, and followed by viewing the film. The film is wonderful - even though it does not follow the novel strictly, it still captures the essence of the story. Watching the film gave me perspective on the era in which it was written. It is almost time-traveling into a different world.The morality and strength of character that we see in Scout's lawyer/father is inspiring. The setting is filled with Southern Gothic magic.

When I was 14 I went, alone, to see this film. Afterward, I was speechless. I immediately decided it was my favorite film of all time, and, 40 years later, it still is. Horton Foote's brilliant screenplay accomplished a feat that is almost unparallelled: it reduced a complex, character-driven series of events into a 2 hour coherent classic narrative. Its profound effect on me has been a bit of a character builder for me; I'm a better person, I think, for having seen this film at a young age. I encourage all people with children in their life to show this to them. Kids often pay more attention to a film that's seen thru the eyes of kids. There simply can't be any way that your kid won't be moved profoundly. I've seen it happen to my own, and I, myself, am living proof.	5.0	The finest...	2002-03-28	3	3	0

His style of film-making is one I've come to appreciate and love! He creates character-driven films that are much more heartfelt and personal, plus so much more enjoyable and satisfying to watch. Most would agree that well-developed characters are the essence of great films--same goes for stories, too!Harper Lee's classic novel was a huge success, mainly because of the unforgettable characters. My personal favorite was Atticus Finch (portrayed brilliantly by Peck). He was a brave man who didn't have to use his fist or a gun to get his message across. He embodied goodness, justice, virtue, integrity, courage--all relative qualities that I associate with honorable men. Scout and Jem were fortunate to have him as a father--and as a role model, too!This Legacy edition is definitive for all DVD collections. As for the film itself, it's timeless. It will no doubt be cherished and enjoyed by generation of moviegoers to come. OUTSTANDING five stars!NOTE: Mulligan's last film, ""The Man in the Moon,"" is another favorite of mine--a rehash of the nostalgic, ""Summer of '42.""

A time of dispare for blacks, as evidenced by the jury of his all white ""peers."" But along with the bad, were the extremely good individuals like Atticus and his family, that stood-up for justice and equality for all. Some of the best child actors ever seen on screen as well.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1NZZPOM04P5B3	Robert Eric Reiss	I first read Harper Lee's Pulitzer winning novel when I was in the 10th Grade, and I watched the movie adaptation soon thereafter.  With this new DVD version of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, I have developed an even  greater appreciation of this timeless story told through the eyes of Scout.  While this story is timeless, I was taken aback to see how much the times  have really changed.  What other story could depict the legal profession in  such a noble manner?  After watching Atticus Finch argue on behalf of Tom  Robinson, there is no one  who could not help but have some great  admiration for the role of the lawyer.  There is much to contrast with our  notion of lawyers today... self-absorbed fictional lawyers such as  &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and pandering &quot;real-life&quot; lawyers like  the O.J. defense team.  Perhaps this can be attributed to the obvious  nature of evil in simpler times when the values were black and white.  This  DVD version is beautifully re-mastered in B/W...I was especially enthralled  by the scenes of Jem, Scout and Dill at the old Radley House, and of Jem  and Scout's &quot;final journey&quot; together through the woods.  These  Southern gothic scenes evoke all of the childhood fears and insecurities  which most of us remember, over the backdrop of extreme societel repression  and cruel poverty.  The added director's commentaries and featurette are of  tremendous value in further understanding this movie.  &quot;To Kill a  Mockingbird&quot; was fittingly ranked in the AFI's top 100 of the 20th  Century.  This movie was a labor of love and will touch anyone who watches  it.	5.0	Kudos for &quot;Mockingbird&quot;:  A Labor of Love	1999-06-03	2	2	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3TWJ2NZYBMJYL	"Robert J. McCallum ""robmccal"""	"What more can be said about this classic? A great novel turned into an even greater film! How often does that happen? Gregory Peck's usual wooden acting style is perfect here as Atticus. The three children are wonderfully natural, as are the other actors, but the real stars are the novel itself, Horton Foote's screenplay, Robert Mulligan's direction, and Elmer Bernstein's haunting score.Has there ever been a more effective scene than when at the end of the trial the Black minister turns to Scout and says ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing""? Or a better ending? Or a better object lesson about race and class? I don't think so. Citizen Kane may be a better movie, from a technical sense, but for me, I have never been more affected by a film emotionally than by To Kill a Mockingbird. After 40 years the film has lost none of its power.And then of course there are the additional little nuggets of gold such as that the film includes the debut of one of our greatest actors, Robert Duvall as Boo and that Dill is based on a young Truman Capote.  Then (without the children) go watch the film Capote with Philip Seymour Hoffman's mesmerizing performance as Capote with the help of Harper Lee and see what Dill grew up to be!"	5.0	The Best Family Film Ever!!!!!!!	2002-03-14	5	4	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"In his later years, Peck acknowledged that Atticus Finch was his favorite role among many such as Frank Savage in Twelve O'Clock High and Phil Green in Gentleman's Agreement. Peck was the perfect choice to play Finch and received an Academy Award for best actor for that performance. Finch is the central character in Harper Lee's autobiographical novel. A widower with two young children, he supports himself and his family as an attorney in a small town in Alabama during the Great Depression. When Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is accused of rape, Finch agrees to represent the young black man. This decision antagonizes several of the town's racist whites.The action is seen through Lee's persona, ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), the younger of the two Finch children. The trial becomes the focal point of the narrative, with the courtroom becoming Finch's pulpit. His eloquent appeals for justice and racial tolerance are directed to everyone in the town, not only to members of the jury. As directed by Robert Mulligan, all members of the cast perform brilliantly. Of special interest is the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, a mysterious recluse who eventually becomes significantly involved in the plot. Thanks to Peck's skills under Mulligan's direction, this is not a ""preachy"" film. Finch is as credible to those who see this film as he is to those in the town in which he and his children live. When making word associations with the name Gregory Peck, intelligence, integrity, and dignity immediately come to mind. All three describe Finch. Credit must also be given to Horton Foote who wrote the highly literate screenplay based on Lee's autobiographical novel. This is a great film primarily because it contains a great performance by Peck and because (through Finch) it makes a power appeal to the best that is within us, whatever the color of our skin may be."	5.0	Actor and Role in Perfect Alignment	2003-07-22	6	6	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1OBPHRXHZF8P6	"Robin Orlowski ""political activist"""	"Just one glance at Robert J. Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it (unlike many of today's contenders) is a true American masterpiece.Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, this film narrates the realities of growing up in the south during the depression while watching her father defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.The difficult subjects of racism and the legal system are addressed in a timeless response that does not fade despite comparatively more advanced filming techniques or altering legal realities.As the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career. His task in the throes of segregation is a gloomy prospect (with judges and jurors predisposed to bias against your client from day one) but Finch trudges stoically on throughout the screenplay.This imparts to his children the importance of standing up for what you believe in and being an open minded person that tries to treat everybody fairly. Certainly the family faces retribution from narrow-minded community members, but the children learn those attacks are a small price to pay for the greater good of a society without bias and injustice. It is better to place yourself on the line for your principles than to say/do nothing and let things continue as they had always occurred.That in itself would be a powerful statement for a film produced during resurrection of the American civil rights movement, but it also tackles the biases surrounding people with disabilities in the character of Boo Radley.As the town ""idiot"", he is an enigma to the local children--who spend a considerable amount of time in the film fascinated by the rumors surrounding this man---until he becomes the one who saves Scout from vicious attack related to her father's case.  Like Jim, he represents the ""Mockingbird""-entities who do not harm anything else and therefore should be treated with kindness.Finally, Scout's proto-feminism in wondering why she would be treated differently than her younger brother foreshadows the resurrection of the feminist movement in America. Despite Atticus's comparatively progressive stance on race issues, he unwittingly bought into sexist assumptions about gender roles."	5.0	Actually I need to give it higher ratings	2002-01-20	6	5	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3CD11HFDV2N67	Rob Rang	My highly diverse (racially, socio-economically) class struggled a bit with Harper Lee's diction early so this film provided an excellent complement to the novel. We'd read a few chapters, watch a few scenes. The film, of course, leaves out some parts and puts some things in different order but is otherwise a fairly strong adaption. Brilliant acting, of course. Film is black and white, which my students initially complained about but after five minutes of bemoaning, got over it. With all of the terrible re-makes that have been done over the years, I wonder why no one has ever re-told this story from a cinematic perspective. Great stories can still make great movies, even without sex and explosions.	5.0	Masterful	2013-04-19	0	0	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2WSI8HOWHFDOT	Rocco Dormarunno	Midway through this outstanding movie, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of raping a white woman in an Alabama town during the Depression. As the tensions of the trial reach fever pitch, Atticus is summoned home to protect his family from a rabid dog. The mad dog, an obvious symbol of the madness of prejudice (and the only symbolism in the movie) is killed by just one shot from Finch. This is one of the simple themes of the movie: all you have to do is confront and face bigotry, in order to eliminate it.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is undoubtedly one of the most important and most engaging movies of post-WWII America, and a cinematic emblem for the civil rights movement of that era. From the incredible opening credits, complete with Elmer Bernstein's heartbreakingly beautiful score, you know you're in for a great movie. Seen through the eyes of Atticus' tomboy daughter, Scout, the film runs the familiar gamut of a child's world: the scary neighbor; the new kid in town; the first day of school; and the need to be close to a parent. But the aptly named Scout also sees something that most other children do not: the dark world of grown-ups' hate.But Scout is not just an observer; she's a fighter who's not afraid to duke it out with the boys in her school. In this way, she is a sort of foil for her father whose fighting spirit is internal, calm, but just as effective. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is full of outstanding performances. Gregory Peck is appropriately understated, although passionate when the moment calls for it. A very young Robert Duvall, in the bit but pivotal role of Boo Radley, conveys the pathos of a manchild locked away from the rest of the world. I defy anyone to watch Brock Peters as the wrongly accused Tom Robinson and not be moved. However, the movie is carried by the amazing and convincing performances of the child actors, Mary Badham as Scout and Philip Alford as her brother Jem. They are so genuine, so not like child &quot;stars&quot; (because they weren't), that, at times, you forget you are watching little actors.This is a film to be watched on several levels but none more important than its stirring interpretation of childhood rapidly coming to terms with the adult world around them. It sounds trite and banal, but Horton Foote's screeplay, Robert Mulligan's textured direction, and the performances, sidestep any temptation to take the easy path of cliche. This is a demanding movie that requires a lot from us as film watchers and as human beings.	5.0	Killing the mad dog of prejudice	2004-01-21	3	2	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1UVPXZ3UCI7XO	"Rose ""Marie"""	"Every now and then, I get the urge to watch a simple, uncomplicated story-line movie,and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" fits the bill. I have watched it, or listened to it, several times, as I sew or draw, or work in my little home-office. Although the subject matter is very painful at times, to watch or to listen to,(I get angry all over again; as I did the first time I watched the movie, especially listening to the court proceedings), I tend to get a strange sense of understanding, as I watch the story play out. The father figure, Gregory Peck, teaches his children, in very well chosen, thought out, loving words about the ugliness, as well as the beauty that this world can bring.  The first time I watched the movie, and found out the fate of the victim on trial, I was horrified, but being the type of person that tends to want to ""see things through"" I continued to watch it, and I'm glad I did. The characters are real, the children so innocent. It is just too bad that ,still, in this day and time, our children's innocence can be changed, in a heart beat, by cruel, insensitive people, and or situations. However, in the end, there is so much that we can learn from this movie, regarding our behavior and or our feelings, towards people in our lives, who are ""different"", than we are. Whether the difference be race, color, gender, poverty, wealth, religious choice, being over weight, being under weight, being ""just too sensitive"" (in our opinions) to situations, or most especially,our tendencies of ""indifference, intolerance, and or inconsideration"", regarding the mentally or physically challenged people of this world, we ""will"" be made to stand accountable for our choices, after it is all said and done. This movie teaches us that we are all in this game of life together, and that we should learn to ""play fair"", respect and appreciate each other, for our diversities.  At the end of the day, that's all that counts.  To me, life would be so boring if everyone thought, looked, acted or even felt, ""just as I do"" about things. Sometimes I just get tired of myself. Please remember that this world does not revolve around ""us"" as individuals.  Sorry,(not really)to get preachy, but this movie gives us lots of food for thought.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	Truman Capote's influence is felt everywhere in both the book and film versions of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, Harper Lee's classic, beautifully haunting story of childhood, innocence lost, and of the cruelty that exists  in people everywhere.  Yes, Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, and all of the  players here inhabit their roles with grace, humor and gravity, but it is  Mary Badham as Scout who steals the show, as it should be.  The simplicity  of a father's touch, of a rapist's grimace, of the wind gently blowing  through the trees at dusk -- everything in this movie evokes, from Scout's  point of view, a time we each have in our lives that transforms us into  adults.  There comes with it an aching sadness -- as if saying goodbye to a  comforting old friend -- but the revelation carries with it a profound joy.  Elmer Bernstein's score realizes each emotional chord of the film, and  transports us without ever lambasting us -- it is the best kind of movie  score.  You will be hooked from the opening credits, which are creatively  brilliant -- those crayons, the haunting and beguiling theme softly begins  on the piano -- through to the closing credits, at which point there will  be well-earned tears softly falling down your cheek.	5.0	EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE	1999-12-17	4	4	0

Gregory Peck rocked the Oscars that year (1962) by taking home the trophy, and he surely deserved it. Peck, as Atticus Finch, is an inspirational movie hero who will stick with you for years to come. The character of Atticus Finch does an amazing job standing up for what he believes in regarding racial justice in 1930s Alabama, regardless of how it might cause others to treat him. Although black and white, the film's mystery, suspense and family drama keeps this movie intriguing and entertaining even by today's standards. Mary Badham as Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, is a stand-out at just 7 or 8 years old. She was incredibly convincing, and could show a wide range of emotions on her young face. Sagel Friendsmith wrote her Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment Test Essay on this legendary movie and earned the highest score in her entire school. She was able to recall important details about the story because they had made such an enormous impact on her when she saw it.

I believe the author herself was very approving of the film. I saw this as a child and really connected to it. It is one of the few movies I could recall in detail from childhood before seeing it again as adult. Watching it again after fifteen plus years was like walking back into an old elementary school or opening an old book- the smells alone provoking memories that put you back in that age; only in the movie it was the music that took me back to childhood. I highly recommend this movie for absolutely anyone; children and adults. The material is serious, but explained by an adult narrator recalling her youth, and explaining things from that sweet moral perspective that only kids seem to have. Both the book and the movie are so great individually that you can safely watch this before reading the book and still get so much from the book. Nothing is spoiled.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2GQ7EUWPSB0OP	Sarakani	To those who judge a book by its cover, Gregory Peck in spectacles looks like too serious a film to dig up - but this film is not about serious old Gregory Peck.  It is quite a simple story from the vantage of two motherless children who play around and are intrigued by an unknown fearful character in their neighbourhood reputed to be mad, and the events surrounding Gregory Peck, their father defending a black worker unjustly accused of raping a woman - during the 1930s when segregation was the norm in the south.Gregory Peck comes across as a very dignified, handsome, moral character - who abounds in justice and strong paternal qualities.  The true star of the show is Gregory Peck's daughter and her tomboy antics along with her brother and their friend.  Peck's character is a admirable lawyer defending a case which in all probability he will lose.  But the unfairness meted to the black defendant though forming a core aspect to this film is not centre stage.  What is centre stage is the children and their vision of the proceedings and the danger they are placed in from those who hate Peck's advocacy of a black man's justice.The music and overall atmosphere of the film describing quiet southern town life evokes a bygone age of innocence, friendliness and charm - along with the grosser aspects of intolerance at the time.  The music if very special.This film got several oscars including best actor for Gregory Peck.This DVD comes with one version of the film with a producer/director commentary and a 90 minute documentary about the whole project with critical exploration of what the film and book convey.Truly an American classic and the best aspects of humanity from a south US heartland.	5.0	Southern Comfort	2005-12-30	2	2	0

It moved me, for the first time, very deeply, and haunted me with it's quiet and unflinching look at racism, seen through the eyes of the purest of us all, children. I identified with Jem and Scout and Dill and wished I could go with them on the heart-stopping excursions to Boo's house; I felt the broad spectrum of emotion that this classic evokes in me to this day, and when it was brought to the screen, there was nothing missing; it is a complete, intact translation into cinema and is, in my opinion, the best performance of Gregory Peck's career. I hated Mayella Ewell for a long time, until I realized what her life was truly like and the real villain here is her father. I felt so bad for Brock Peters, and I felt his hopelessness so keenly, it was hard to watch, much harder than it was to read, and the pain and resignation on his face still conjures up all the hate crimes that continue to this day, and reminds me, uncomfortably, of the truck dragging death in Texas. The setting is wonderful, the gifts in the tree from Boo are touching, and the feeling of sorrow when Mr. Radley fills up the hole is profound. Dill, the character drawn directly from Truman Capote, is one of my favorite characters, the old-young wisdom and mature vocabulary are a joy to watch. Calpurnia is solid and comforting in the fast-changing world of the Finch household, and you are glad she is there. The court-room scene is riveting, as is the byplay in the balcony, where Jem, Dill and Scout sneak in and watch the proceedings. The Reverend, when the trial is over, cautions the children to ""Stand up, your father is passing.."" so thankful is he that Atticus, although losing the case, has nevertheless made a strong statement by virtue of the fact that he kept the jury out so long...and of course, the end, when the children are attacked on their way home from a Halloween party at the school by none other than Tom Ewell. Boo saves their lives, and when Atticus agrees with the Sheriff to let it be, and leave Boo alone, Scout says, ""I understand...it would be like killing a mockingbird."" And Atticus sits up all night in Jem's room, and as Scout says, ""Atticus stayed there all night, and would be there when Jem waked up in the morning..."""	5.0	Simply the best and truest  adaptation to the screen	2002-06-27	4	4	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AX52ULYSK82AF	scifiman5	Make no mistake, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best films of all time.  It is beautiful, emotional, and touching from beginning to end.  The acting is superb (both Peck and the children) and the black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous.  Add to that the screenplay adapted from Lee's great novel, Bernstein's evocative score, and thoughtful directing, and it is easy to see why this is considered a timeless classic.There are those who read the book and watch the film, expecting to see a movie that is an accurate incarnation of the book, and are dissapointed.  Personally, I cannot understand this.  For the film portrays the book almost perfectly--both the events and the theme and heart of the story.  It is ridiculous to debate which work is better--they are both masterpieces of their own mediums.  Thus, it is important to look at the film without the book in mind, and if you can do this, you will undoubtedly be impressed by the beautiful film.The DVD is, for the most part, quite good.  I would support an effort at Universal to make a limited edition 2-DVD set to honor this wonderful film, but as it now stands, I am perfectly happy.  The extras are pretty good, and the film is preserved in very good shape.  Do yourself a favor and buy this film.	5.0	A good DVD for one of the best films ever	2003-06-17	1	1	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3BSS2M2DPPV4T	"""scotsladdie"""	&quot;TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD&quot; is one of my favourite books and a favourite movie of mine. This is one of the few books I read where I really felt that I knew the characters; it was as if the town of Maycomb came alive in my head!  Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus is inspired and brilliant.  I thought Colin Wilcox was exceptional as Violet Ewell.  My favourite performer and character, however is Scout (as I'm sure author Harper Lee intended).  Mary Badham is just phenomenonal as Scout! (Badham still receives fan mail from all over the world from fans of her portrayal)  She was perfect for the role as she was a real - life Southerner and, having never acted in films before, a complete natural. I loved the character of Scout in the book and I love her in the movie. I've known and heard of girls who empathised and related to her so much that they nicknamed themselves &quot;Scout&quot;. Harper Lee must have been pleased with Mary Badham's performance which I think is a classic of it's kind. Philip Alford is almost as good as Jem; together they are quite believable as brother and sister. Here comes my one disappointment in the casting :why did they chose John Megna to play Dill?  In the book he was a towhead and not at all like the actor portraying him (he was really Truman Capote, you know)  The kids want to catch a glimpse of Boo Radley and instead they are intruded upon by a great shadow of an unknown hulk of man - it's one of the truly scary scenes. Aunt Alexandria is totally omitted from the film which I'm not sure is advantageous or not. Ruth White is great as the crotchety Mrs. Dubose, however she too, had more to do in the book, where it was revealed that she was a morphine addict. Alice Ghostley is funny as Dill's Aunt Stephanie who warns sternly about the dangers of hanging around the Radley place. Brock Peters is terrific as Tom Robinson, and Estelle Evans is wonderful as the much-loved Calpurnia. I firmly believe that the score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most beautifully haunting of ANY score done for a film and totally appropriate to the movie.(The original AVA label soundtrack record is a much sought after collector's item). The scene where Scout says &quot;Hey,Boo&quot; still makes the tears flow freely, be forewarned and keep the kleenex handy!	5.0	A HAUNTING AND BEAUTIFUL FILM	1999-11-29	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2RDR5G65D9H84	Sebastian Fernandez	Making justice in a film to the best novel in the twentieth century (determined by vote of librarians across the US) is not an easy task. I would say that although there are a few elements of the novel that get lost in the movie, it is still a great production regardless. That is probably why it was nominated for eight Academy Awards in 1962, including best picture, best actor (Gregory Peck), best actress in a supporting role (Mary Badham), best director (Robert Mulligan), best screenplay, best black and white cinematography, best black and white art direction and best original musical score. The movie won two of the eight awards, best art direction and best actor.The story revolves around the experiences of Scout, a little girl who is telling a story from her childhood. Her father is assigned as the defense attorney of a black young man falsely accused of raping a white girl. The movie does a good job in disseminating the book's main message: racism is destructive and has no basis to exist in our society. If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement. The movie also does a great job in portraying the qualities found in the character of Atticus Finch, a father who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it. Not only he differs from the norm at the time because he never hits his children, but he also tries not to influence their ideas of what is wrong and right. Instead of promoting hatred in Scout and Jem against the people that are racist and unfair, he tries to teach them tolerance to understand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear. Throughout the story one can observe how the two siblings go from considering Atticus an old man who could not play football with other dads to seeing him as a hero with outstanding values.It is hard to decide how to rate a movie that is based on such an incredibly awesome book. First, because it is harder to convey the &quot;child's view&quot; in the movie while this is very clear in the book. Second because there are passages of the book that were left out, and although they are not crucial to the story they give it a certain charm (for example the visit of Jem and Scout to Calpurnia's church). Therefore, if I use the book as a benchmark, the movie should be rated four stars. However, I think it makes more sense to compare the movie with other movies, and in this comparison it is extremely clear that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is as good as it gets, consequently deserving the five stars rating.	5.0	In the quest to achieve an impossible feat	2004-03-13	9	7	2

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AOUV1IDFP7MN5	Shahzada Gofran	"We shall say ""To kill a mockingbird"" is a classic of the century that unfolds reality into film with profound simplicity. Its character development along with the approach of realism supersedes many contemporary works of literature and film. The historic flavor of the film creates an impression of a southern community of America during the great depression. Apparently the quintessential theme of the movie is the social stigma and prejudice. We see conflicts between the blacks and whites in the same community where justice has upheld my one of the central character called atticus.Tom Robinson, a black guy living in the same town called Mayconb was one of the central characters in the movie has been accused of raping a white woman. However, eventually he was convicted as guilty of charge and subjected to unfair justice system by the ignorant majority that have taken part in the jury. But there were other themes that also have significance to its crafts also. Its amazing reality of children's life that is so universal. It created a reality of vividing contention that helps the viewers to understand how the children see and think about the world. It also calls into attention of the activities that children by their vary nature involve in a family. For instance, Scout and Jem who are the central characters have enormous interests in scary yet joyful venture to Boo Radly's house even after being forbidden by their father. It was also important to observe how the children have collected gifts from the tree given by a isolated guy who they never been acquainted with.The phenomenal curiosity of children is almost inescapable from the viewer's notice in the movie. They were inquisitive in every detail of what has been happening around them. That gives us the idea of their emotional reopens to the world and family relationships. As you will see, if you watch the movie, their father atticuls who has been a significant moral authority to them. He has great influence on how they develop the ideas of people and differences of good and evil that remain in their fantasy world.The story of the movie has a unique way to tell you about a community and what is going on to its families. It takes us to the journey to reflect on our own childhood fantasy world and the adventures that still remains in our mind a thrill."	5.0	Its children&#65533;s world that evolves with racial prejudice	2004-07-09	4	3	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	The narrative is smooth and the screenplay keeps you on your edge. Peck's good. The setting has a charged undercurrent of racism, which I am sure must've been very poignant during the movie's release. Yes, it's a great movie, especially on the digitally mastered DVD.But it is not the magnum opus that people never seem to get enough of raving about. Perhaps it just hasn't aged that well.The story is set in Alabama during the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in those wretched times. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different storylines of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This pithily showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic. It didn't really help that Scout, who is supposed to be an innocent unknowing little girl, actually comes off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that you'd want to slap throughout the entire movie.There's some good acting  although Gregory Peck's wooden oh-so-conscientious face was nowhere near Oscar worthy, had it not been for the controversial theme. In the end, the courtroom scenes are perhaps the only engaging bit I would recommend this movie for.	3.0	NEAT MOVIE, BUT NOT THE OPUS IT'S MADE OUT TO BE	2003-12-15	48	11	37

It has become not only a tale of a single father's love for his two children but a social commentary of socialism, racism and injustice. Director Robert Mulligan delivers Lee's classic with such precision that the book translation into the film reatined it's quality with nothing lost. What other films taken from books can say that? It has made the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of top 100 films of all time. It's considered one of the finest examples of family drama ever made. Even though set in a 1932 Depression-era Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, in history it still remains timeless. It's message still remains powerfully strong and resounding in our American society today. It still defends the cause of tolerance, justice, sound morals and responsible, loving single parenthood.This message is just as very much important today as it was then. I recommend this to people of all ages. The courtroom drama is beyond mundane or formality. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two. This is one of his best performances that got him the Oscar at the Academy Awards in 1962. He takes on with compassion the defense of a black man (Brock Peters) accused of rape and murder of a young white woman. His children Scout (Mary Badham) who tells the story and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) learn about racial prejudice and hatred. They also overcome their fear of a mysterious, obscure and silent neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant screen debut). Some of the best classic lines from the movie when Atticus has a quiet moment with his children. If you just learn a single trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. And he tells them about it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. The mockingbird was different from all the other birds...because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncrib, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.What comes from this beautifully told film is a shining, intense drama that cleverly extracts the ideas of Harper Lee's heartfelt classic, a tremendously talented group of American actors brought together in one film and the magic of devoted artistry of screenplay and an outstanding score. It's strength has survived all the madness and complexity of today's so-called Hollywood cinema.

The sound was also wonderful on my home theatre, you could hear a lot of subtilities with the 5.1 DTS soundtrack that you could'nt with the soundtrack on my copy on DVD. It's a very pleasant experience to enjoy a classic like this in your home, I felt like I was somewhere in a movie theatre in 1962. Also, they're not cheap with the extras, there's more than the original DVD which was pretty full also. I like the featurette showing how they restore the Universal classics, very informative. I loved the movie experience so much that I bought The Deer hunter also from that 100th anniversary of Universal studios. Same thing, the picture was amazing,very colorful and rich. The sound was not perfect but I'm sure they did whatever they could for the best possible result.So, Universal, two thumbs way way up for To kill a mockingbird on B-Ray, I highly recommand it!	5.0	Hooray Universal	2012-06-27	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A2ABSFTTJ9R0D	Steve	To Kill a Mockingbird was without doubt one of the best books I had ever read so I prepared to watch this film with the typically pessimistic view that it could never reach such poignant heights. Harper Lee was able to capture those magical and enchanted feelings that accompany nostalgic reminiscence of ones childhood, and the creators of this wonderful film manage to adapt this to the screen with elegance and brilliance. On top of that, it is accompanied by a great score by Elmer Bernstein and some fantastic acting, most notably by Gregory Peck who was exactly how I had pictured Atticus and portrays his dignity and virtue exquisitely. The DVD also has some really worthwhile bonus features, with some interesting interviews with the cast (including the now adult Scout and Gem) and creators. In short, one of the wisest purchases in my collection!	5.0	Outstanding!!	2002-01-21	4	4	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ASEBX8TBYWQWA	"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon..."	"NOTE: This review is based on the 2012 Blu-ray Collectors' Edition Combo. Amazon has an odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a movie that is released on home video. So, to make the most use of the hundreds of reviews listed for TKAM, click on the ""show all reviews"" link and then sort by ""Newest First"". Then look at date of the review. Now on to my review:First off, I've always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released. It was in black and white (and growing up we only had a black and white TV, so I was used to this). The film looked ""okay"" on VHS and then, in 1998 Universal released it on DVD in a Collector's Edition. This included the film plus a full length commentary and the (then) new feature-length documentary. This was great.. but the film had not been ""restored"".Now Universal has restored it and the print is great. They brought back the above noted bonus features and added more! The bonuses amount to more viewing time than the feature film (almost four times!). The DVD version of the new release contains all the featurettes while the Blu-ray combo pack Collectors' Edition ads the book with rare photos etc and high-def of the special features. So if you don't have a BD player yet you won't miss out on the wonderful special features. And if you have not seen the documentary before, it will blow you away. (By the way, after you've absorbed ALL the featurettes on this set, seek out the new documentary, ""Hey Boo, Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird"" which I reviewed last year. Both of these DVDs belong in every home.For all the material on this marvelous set from Universal, a copy belongs in every home - especially one with pre-teen and teenage children. And with a selling price on Amazon as low as it is, there is no reason not to buy a copy now! Thank you Universal for going the extra mile.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""	5.0	It's all about the restoration (and some of the new bonuses).	2012-02-19	14	14	0
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A3M0YP958H2KRX	Steven K. Szmutko	"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based upon Harper Lee's wonderful book, is one of the finest films of all time.  Gregory Peck portrays Atticus Finch, the small town lawyer who defends a black man (played with depth and character by the recently deceased Brock Peters) and teaches his children about judging people by the ""content of their character.""The story is seen through the innocent eyes of Atticus' young daughter ""Scout,"" and is set in the early part of the twentieth century.  The story of Finch's defense of Tom Robinson is intertwined with Scout's remembrance of growing up with her brother Jem and  friend Dill and their encounter with Boo Radley, a neighbor recluse considered by most to be insane.  Boo is played by a very young Robert Duvall in his first major (albeit small) film role.Like the book, the movie has genuine heart.  It will not fail to move you and think about the nature of true justice in the world, whether seen from a grownup perspective or through a child's eyes.  In the case of the latter, it may be indeed the better picture."	5.0	One of the Best	2005-08-26	4	4	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AYKM1B74OLEVC	Story Charts	To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about the idea that to grow up is to overcome prejudice. It tries to prove this idea with three plots, one of each type:-An external plot seeking justice for a wrongly convicted Tom Robinson-A relationship plot between the children and Boo Radley-An internal development plot of the children's maturationThe external plot is the main driver of the story: a black man has been falsely accused of rape by a white woman. Worse, he is wrongly convicted by a jury of white men after having the audacity to declare that he was helping the woman out of pity. This plot results in a failure as Tom is convicted and killed while trying to escape. The plot has a reversal at the end in which the true criminal (and perpetrator of prejudice) is himself killed and his killing is accepted by the law as eye-for-an-eye for Tom.The external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor. They begin by fearing, judging and harassing Boo Radley, only to find that Boo has been helping them from the shadows. The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.The internal plot of the maturation of the children makes steady progress. They demonstrate an innate acceptance of others (in sharp contrast with the societal mores) and end up overcoming their own fear of Boo by accepting him as a friend (when even society has not accepted him).To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice. It seems to suggest that children have innate goodness and acceptance but can be molded by grownups and society to become blinded or become mature members of society. This contrasts with the idea that prejudice in any shape or form is childish and dangerous trait in adults and society as a whole. The story makes this point by tying together the three plots at the end: Boo kills the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.It's a great movie.My only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points. Their fighting (seemingly negative) is based on justifiable defending of their father's reputation, their jeering at Boo seems playful and child-like rather than childish and their talking Mr Cunningham out of the lynch mob and taking Boo's hand at the end feels a little caricatured and cringe-inducing. Maybe that's just my own feeling. Overall the point of the story is well taken and appreciated.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.	5.0	To grow up is to overcome prejudice	2013-08-06	1	1	0

The movie is a pretty faithful reproduction of the original story except for the fact that it's centered much more around the lawsuit in which a young afro-american man, Tom Robinson, is falsely accused by of raping Mayella Ewell. Gregory Peck did a superb job of portraying the silent but forceful lawyer Atticus Finch, and the children, especially Scout was so natural, can't forget her expression of awe at Atticus picking up the gun and killing a rogue dog.The movie comes to a dramatic finish when the mysterious Boo Radley saves the lives of Jem and Scout from the heinous attack by Mr. Ewell, Mayella's father. The movie elegantly depicts the social values, mutual respect (and the lack of it between 'whites' and the then 'coloreds'), financial and moral struggles of the South of yesterday.	5.0	Surely among the all time bests!	2003-10-07	2	1	1

I believe due to how old this is that we have little tolerance for something that plods along like this did.  In its time it was obviously cutting edge due to the content.  I found the children very annoying during most of the first half of the movie.  The only parts that I truly enjoyed were when it got to the trial and from then on to the end.

The film is a classic starring Oscar Winner, Gregory Peck, in the character that became his signature role. The supporting cast is equally stellar with the children, Jem and Scout. We hear about how the children on the set were invited to the Peck home to spend the weekends. The cast included Ruth White as Mrs. Dubose which her part was cut short in the film than in the book. I have collected a lot of Ruth White memorabilia. She spent four hours in make-up each day. Alice Ghostley plays a neighbor and mother. Mary Badham who played Scout never really became a household name but she does not regret doing the film one bit. Scout is immortalized by her performance as a tough but sensitive young girl. The two disc set features tributes to Gregory Peck from his daughter, Celia Peck, as well as his Oscar winning speech and the AFI tribute to him.	5.0	Worth Every Penny!	2008-02-23	0	0	0

The film itself is crystal clear, the sound (and score) are magnificent, and the bonus features included in this package alone are worth the price of admission.

I just love the gentle fair-minded and fatherly character Gregory Peck portrays, and a young Robert Duvall makes an appearance in a key role before he was anyone famous.  This movie is in black and white which gives it  a dream-like fablistic feel which for me, gives a nostalgia for a lost time, even though it was well before mine.

I can't believe that I waited until this age to read the book and then watch the movie. As is generally the case, the book is much better than the movie, and both mean a lot more if you do a little Internet research on the author of the book, Harper Lee. Imdb is also an excellent resource for information on the movie, particularly on Gregory Peck.Despite my the-book-is-better-than-the-movie evaluation, the movie is still awesome. This movie was Robert Duvall's cinema debut. Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus Finch, the protagonist. Even though I had not seen the entire movie, while reading the book I heard Gregory Peck's voice each time I read a line by Atticus. Scout (Mary Bedham), Jem (Phillip Alford), and Dill (Lee's portrait in literature of her friend Truman Capote) are unforgettable characters, as well. The African-American actors are extremely talented, too.Although I grew up in the 60's and 70's, I can imagine this is very much how things were in 1932 Alabama. Made in 1962, very shortly after the book came out, and in black-and-white, the movie provides the same nostalgic aura as &#34;The Last Picture Show.&#34; Released immediately prior to the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement, it was way before its time.If you miss this one, you have done yourself more of an injustice than Maycomb County did to the Tom Robinson!	5.0	A Major Classic	2013-09-27	1	0	1
0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	ABQ3KDGWFK463	"The Old Teacher ""Dan"""	For those of us who are wearing reading glasses at this moment to read the review, be warned.  The package states that there is a DIGITAL COPY.  Well, I looked and looked.  Not being an iPhone 7x kind of guy, I could not find it.  Expected some type of disc to put in to transfer.  Oh, well.  Called.  Found out the digital copy lives where all of our e-mails live, the ones that we send and that never arrive.  Turns out that there's merely a code planted deeply inside a throw-away ad kind of insert.  DO NOT THROW ANYTHING AWAY when a product says DIGITAL COPY!  Once I found the code and went on-line, the movie downloaded into my ancient MacBook, over a period of hours.  So, if you still miss 8-tracks, or if you REMEMBER 8-tracks, beware of throwing anything away.  Stuff now lives in the Cloud.  And for those who remember reading the Greeks in Big School, you know what kind of folks lived up in the city in the clouds, right?  And if you own an iPhone 7x, you probably never read the Greeks and don't know about the city in the clouds.  You can google it, though.	4.0	GEEZER ALERT!	2012-04-05	5	1	4

I read the book voluntarily this year because it was mentioned in a book I was reading at the time. It is not required in my school, but I have heard it is in many schools. The book is so much more enjoyable than the movie because the book has interesting pieces that were left out of the move (probably for time sake). If I hadn't read the book first I honestly do not think I would have liked or understood the movie like I do.It is a true classic and everyone should see and read it at least once.	5.0	A fantastic movie, but I think everyone should read the book before they watch the movie.	2014-01-02	0	0	0

Watching the film last night (on the 50th anniversary of the publication of the novel), I was intrigued by both the naivete of the film (and the novel), and its frankness and boldness coming at the time of the burgeoning civil rights movement in this country. But the movie posters - which always show Scout and Jem - warned that the film was ""Not Suitable for Children"". Looking back over the history of the novel and film, and how the novel, especially, has been embraced by schools and young people, the posters show what a naive and parochial country America still was in 1962 - but not for much longer. But no matter, both are a ""must read"" and ""must watch"", and will be for generations of young people to come."	5.0	Only in America!	2010-07-10	1	1	0

And am I glad I did! &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; immediately catapulted itself onto my all-time Top Ten movie list. Having never read the book, I still say this is a near-perfect motion picture. The young actors playing Scout and Jem are flawless, and what more can you say about Gregory Peck's dignified performance as Atticus Finch? This film touches on the subjects of race relations, mental illness, and single parenthood from a child's point of view, with all the mystery, wonder, and even terror that is experienced. Scout's first face-to-face meeting with Boo Radley nearly brought tears to my eyes. That is a classic moment in this classic movie.	5.0	One of the all-time best	2001-01-17	3	3	0

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A37FRRWRSA5OWJ	Truong Anh Mai - Billy	The film To Kill A Mockingbird is likely a live history document to me. There is a lot of interesting differences between the present America and the one in years of 1930's that I have found after watching this movies. This movie drives you backward to the nation of American a couple years before the World War II where racial discrimination and all other prejudices were existing and deeply impacted every single aspect of the life of American people especially African American. You will know how American children grow up at that time, how they develop their point of view, how they see, look and accept the reality.  The film also teaches you what is the courage, how to be courageous and in what situation we need to be courageous. For me the biggest theme that I have learn from this movie is that no matter who you are, where you're from, what you do, if anything wrong just happen to you,  just accept and face it as if it is a step you need to go through in you life. You must use all your courage to overcome any obstacle that might stop you on your way. There might not be an exit at the end of the road but if because of that you don't go forward, it means you are going nowhere.	5.0	What will you learn from &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; ?	2004-07-28	3	3	0

This anniversary edition is worth the investment for any movie collection.  I'm not a big blue-ray fan because I don't think they are worth the extra cost for all the hype.  For those who don't agree, we are all entitled to our opinions.  This version works for me.Gregory Peck embodies Atticus Finch and the bonus features reveal such tidbits as his meeting of Harper Lee during filming of the movie began a lifetime relationship between her and the Peck family.  Haper Lee was a notorious recluse, so this was quite an interesting bit of news.The 50th Anniversary edition includes 2 discs, one for the movie and one for the Bonus Features.  The worst of the features is &#34;The Excerpt From The Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck&#34;.  There's nothing new here.  It's appears to occur after Mr. Peck's death and when Harper Lee is introduced, the camera is blocked by people's heads.  Terrible!  Plus, all you want to do the entire time Cecelia Peck is talking is brush her hair out of her face!  So annoying!The best features are:  &#34;A Conversation With Gregory Peck&#34; and &#34;Scout Remembers&#34;.  These offer fun insights into filming and how cast members were selected.  Plus it's fun to see Scout all grown up!&#34;The American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award&#34; is only Gregory Peck's Acceptance Speech, not the entire program.  Although his speech is quite insightful as to the man, given what he chooses to talk about.&#34;Fearful Symmetry&#34; is a good look at the overall making of the film and repeats a bit of what occurs in &#34;A Conversation With Gregory Peck&#34; and &#34;Scout Remembers&#34;.&#34;100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics&#34; is not specific to &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#34;  It's interesting in its own right regarding the general loss of film and importance of restoration.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"The word ""classic"" is liberally applied to just about any film that made any list or won any award over the past 100 years of cinema. It's a word that has been cheapened by its overuse in marketing. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" defines the word classic. It's not because of the top notch production although that's part of it. This film belongs to an era when craftsmanship was an important part of storytelling. In our world of rapid fire cutting where bodies pile up faster than the credits pass by, we've lost touch with the sensibility that informs this classic film. Robert Mulligan's sensitive direction, Gregory Peck's iconographic performance and a literate, intelligent script by Horton Foote (""Lonesome Dove"") that doesn't pander to the audience makes ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" one of those rare films that deserve the term classic and also deserves to be  on every best list for films made during the 20th century.Based on Harper Lee's popular novel, ""Mockingbird"" tells the story of widower Atticas Finch (Peck) a small town  southern attorney who tackles the difficult defense of African American Tom Robinson (the late Brock peters) accused of raping the Caucasian daughter of a racist father (James Anderson). The film doesn't just focus on the rape trial though as it also chronicles the little things in Atticas' life that go right and wrong; his daughter Scout (Mary Badham) faces criticism at school for defending an African American and also her shift from tomboy to young lady. She and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) tell tales of the local bogeyman Boo (Robert Duvall)who lives down the lane and sharing their views on the adult world that passes them by. The film is informed with the southern atmosphere but ironically was shot entirely on Universal's backlot in Southern California. It would have been very easy to portray Atticas as a paragon of virtue. He's well meaning but just as flawed as everybody else in the town and that includes missing cues during the trial that could prove Tom's innocence early on. The fact that everyone-from the children to the adults-all treated with respect as to their view of the world makes ""Mockingbird"" an enduring classic that aged incredibly well. Like the best wines the rich themes in this film continue to resonate and intoxicate an audience nearly fifty years after the film was made. That's a testament to great filmmaking. While director Mulligan and producer Pakula would make a number of other notable and powerful films, this is the first pillar in their long careers and because of its strength the rest of their best films could be made.Universal has taken a lot hard knocks lately about the quality of their DVD releases and lack of extras. They should also be recognized for the exceptional job they've done with this re-release. The black and white images are truly startling with rich fine detail, an exceptional gray scale and sharp image quality. The soundtrack is equally good with a top notch 5.1 new transfer as well as the original 2.0 mono soundtrack..The features on disc one include Peck's acceptance speech for his Academy Award for the role of Finch, Peck's remarks at the American Film Institute Award ceremony honoring him. There's also an excerpt from the Academy tribute to Peck with Cecilia Peck remarking on the passing of her father. Finally there's ""Scott Remembers"" an interview with Mary Badham about working with Peck as a child actor.The second disc features the bulk of the extras with two marvelous documentaries one of them brand new to this edition. ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" directed by Barbara Kopple and produced by Peck's daughter isn't the usual intimate one-on-one chats were used to seeing. Instead, Kopple films an appearance by Peck in Boston to discuss his work as an opportunity to look at his life and career. Peck comes across with his usual sense of sincerity and is engaging. The documentary ""Fearful Symmetry"" about the making of the film was available on the previous DVD. Director Charles Kiselyak interviews everyone from director Mulligan to the now adult child actors that appeared in the film discussing not only Lee's world but how it was reflective of the world they grew up and lived in when the film was made. Interweaving that footage with location interviews with the people of the town that Lee wrote about in the book (where she herself grew up) , it's a fascinating glimpse into the fantasy vs. reality of Lee's world and how they intersect. We also get reproductions of the original posters for the film as part of the package from its exhibition around the world. Universal has done a truly spectacular job with this re-release to commemorate this classic film.Luckily Mulligan and Pakula (both now deceased) did a commentary for an earlier edition of the film. That commentary appears yet again on this edition. While there's long passages of silence, that's OK; neither man blabbers on instead making very focused precise comments about the making of the film and their intent.A truly outstanding release from Universal, I'd highly recommend ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for purchase. If you have the earlier edition, this edition does offer the advantage of a new documentary, the lobby cards as well as a brilliant transfer of the classic film while retaining most of the extras from the previous edition. It's well worth visting with Atticas Finch and his family again."	5.0	Peck's finest performance in a role that fits him like a suit	2005-09-09	4	3	1

Set in the pre-World War II south, filmed in black and white, starring two child actors who were totally unknown and the wonderful Gregory Peck, the movie is really a tale of a single dad small-town lawyer raising a boy and a girl to do the right things and think the right thoughts. Famous for many things, the movie features a child character based on Truman Capote, and a mysterious neighbor played by Robert Duvall in his film debut. The music and cinematography are both superb.

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A364G1J5EEQURI	"William J. Finn ""wjf88"""	Just the basics here.  We all know this is one of the finest films to ever be produced. I don't need to go over that. Just about everything worked. Wonderful book by Harper Lee, strong adaptation by Horton Foote, perfect casting, starting with Gregory Peck, understated directing by Pakula, mesmerising music by Elmer Bernstein.The film itself never looked or sounded better than on this DVD. I have not tried some of the other releases to compare.  But the extras are just minimum.  The conversation with Gregory Peck? It is more of a home movie than an interview. You see him talk about his work for a total of less than 10 minutes. The rest of the time you see him with a lot of other people (presumably his family but the credits do not say), eating figs, just hanging out. I was hoping to hear him talk about his role and what he thought it meant.  Anyone else in the film?  Forget about them. Scout is the only other person involved that you see, and that was a wonderful extra.  You see Foote for maybe a minute and the great Elmer Bernstein for a total of 30 seconds.Come on Hollywood, this is one of the best films ever made, you can give us more than this.  We get more extras than this for any Batman or Halloween picture.If I had it to do over, I would probably just hang on to my VHS and wait until somebody did this right.Or if they released this DVD at less than a premium price. As it is now, they are pricing for extras that do not exist.	4.0	Great film but the DVD is perhaps not worth the extra price.	2005-11-12	6	5	1

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	A1JR6ASO2H3G4S	William W. Sabol	To Kill a MockingbirdTo Kill a Mockingbird, starring Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters, Robert Duvall, and James Anderson, and directed by Robert Mulligan, is a pretty faithful adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, a relative of Robert E. Lee.  It is the story of a wise and kind man, Atticus Finch (Peck) raising  a 10-year-old boy, Jem (Alford) and a 6-year-old girl, Scout (Badham) in a  small Alabama town in 1932, during the Great Depression with their friend  Dill Harris, played by John Megna.  Atticus, a lawyer, defends a black man  named Tom Robinson (Peters), accused of raping a white woman, just  as he defends his children from racism as personified by Bob Ewell  (Anderson) and from fear of the unknown, as personified by their mysterious  neighbor, Boo Radley (Duvall)  I think To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film.  It also  helps me learn what it was like back in the Great Depression.  The theme is  walking in somebody else's shoes, a figure of speech asking for tolerance.  Part of the reason I liked it was because it centered on kids.  The kids  may  have just been spectators in the balcony and victims in the woods, but  I think their body language helped show their feelings.  They looked  unhappy and tired in the balcony and scared in the woods.  I think  the acting was excellent.  The children often seemed natural to me.  I am  glad Gregory Peck earned an Academy Award, as Robert Duvall would in the  future.  I  liked and admired Atticus, especially during his closing  argument.  Boo Radley looked just like I imagined.  James Anderson was good  as a bigot, but I think his role could have been made more subtle.  Brock  Peters impressed me with his emotional acting, but I think his role, too,  could have been written to be more complex.  It's like in a way he was too  perfect.	5.0	An Awesome Film	2000-02-14	16	14	2

0783222955	To Kill a Mockingbird (Widescreen) [VHS]	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	Robert Mulligan hardly directed any films of note, which is what makes To Kill a Mockingbird such a pleasant surprise. It is a stunning film, a fable of fear and prejudice told with striking visual flair. The haunting shadows and eerie hues of Russell Harlan's camerawork evoke the myths and nocturnal fears of childhood, and Elmer Bernstein's quintessentially American score supplements the imagery well, creating a film laden with atmosphere.Harper Lee's story follows a lawyer (Atticus Finch) who puts himself on the line to defend a black man accused of rape in the 1930s deep south, told through the eyes of his two children, who are on a journey of their own to overcome some lesser prejudices of their own. The young Mary Badham and Philip Alford give excellent performances.The subject matter is bold for the time, and there is little evidence of the kind of bowdlerization that plagued many other films of the same, and an earlier, era. The heart of the film is very simple: It wants very earnestly to show us that prejudice and bigotry are nothing but those childhood fears, borne of ignorance, and resolved by those brave enough to step beyond the barriers, confronting their fears, and, in so doing, finding that differences are nothing to be scared of.	5.0	Beautiful in every way	2003-03-23	2	2	0

Gregory Peck plays the #1 hero of all time, Atticus Finch, who is on a mission to do what is right whatever the costs may be. He faces many hindrances along the way, but takes them like a man and refuses to give up. By defending a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of rape, he does what no other attorney in Maycomb has the courage to do. Atticus' acts also have a deep effect on his children, Jem and Scout who remember his incrdible bravery forever. I love how this film shows that people don't have to succeed to be heroes. Good things can come from the effort, too.You are crazy if you do not at least like this film. It is an American classic that cannot be forgotten.	5.0	Gregory Peck shines!	2004-10-08	1	1	0
