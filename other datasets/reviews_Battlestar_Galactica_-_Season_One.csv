1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3MCIAFO37VH14	"2-Stage ""2-Stage"""	Some times I just could not figure out where in space or time I was in.  But then that might be expected.  The acting was really good.  Characters well developed and the effects were 2005..but good.  Not overdone.  Kind of a Deep Space Nine with descent acting and an edgy plot.  And not a little sex.  There that ought to sell it.  But even that was done tastefully.  This is a well color graded product from a post production standpoint.  Visually a delight with good camera moves.  Good action.  Radio communications are really realistic so kudos to whoever spent the time to do that.There are some really good looking actors in this--and they all have angst.  I like that.  No heros emerged..or they are all heros I suppose you can say.Still, for the narrative and arc--where in space time am I?  And if this is post-futuristic (you'll have to see it to understand that), how do we get from there to here?  So 4 stars instead of 5.	4.0	Retro but inciteful	2013-01-20	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2O64AG9B5QS8O	&#34;Sarah&#34; B	If I have only one negative to say about this show is that if this version of the show was shown in 1978 when I was 4 my parents probably wouldn't have allowed me to watch this show until I was older.  I'm thankful to be the age of 33 this month and to have watched the original series when I was a kid.  There is no comparisons to both versions to Battlestar Galactica.  The original Battlestar Galactica was cheesy, humorous and fake (although I still hold the original dearly to my heart.) I too was a critic when I heard that they were remaking this show with Starbuck and Boomer being female but now 4 years later have I completely changed my mind and am eating my words.  I never thought the remake was ever going to work but after 2 of my best friends and Howard Stern talking about how great this show really is I had to finally give it a watch.  I borrowed season 1 which includes the miniseries, 2.0 and 2.5 I'm still finishing 2.0 and 2.5 right now marathoning the episodes and boy was I wrong.  This isn't a remake but a reimagined version of the original.  The writing is very racy, explicit and adult oriented majority of the time but now that I'm older and can appreciate to know the difference between reality and fiction it's just refreshing.  I know that when I was a kid I wouldn't understand what's going on and I'm pretty sure that a lot of the show would scare me but now being older I understand how realistic and fun this version is as well.  I can't stress enough to anyone out there that is discovering the new series for the first time not to compare it to the original.  The original was created in a different era as the wagon trail, cold era was slowing coming to an end.  Westerns were very popular during the 50's to the 70's while the 80's introduced the pop culture with a redifined science fiction including Airwolf, Knight Rider, Star Trek the next Generation, V, etc. and of course in the 90's you had Deep Space Nine, Enterprise, Voyager, Babylon 5 and others where here after 9/11 things have changed.  Ronald Moore formerly one of the great producers of DS9 and David Eick have come over and developed a huge reimagined version of Battlestar Galactica.  While some of the characters have changed and writing style has become more mature the premise of the show is still the same.  Galactica is still trying to find Earth and I'm glad that in the miniseries also includes a little homage to the original by showing the original Basestars and the cylon centurions before the decommision ceremony plus during the decommision ceremony plays the original Stu Phillips theme.Again don't stray from this new series and give it a chance.  By the time you finish the 1st season all the things that even I was critical with go out the window.  You can't miss an episode it's a Babylon 5, Band of Brothers and Sapranos style of writing.  If your only looking for an upbeat, cheesy and happy atmosphere than watch the original but I've learned in my 33 years of life that you have to give things a chance and I'm thankful for watching these episodes so far.  Very thought provoking and entertaining I have to say this is by far the best science fiction show ever made next to Babylon 5 and even better than Star Trek.The music also is a very nice touch to this reimagined remake of the show.  Sure the original Stu Phillips music was very bombastic and thematic being upbeat where here is very much held back not to a point where it's boring but it fits the mold of the story very well.  Again I'm still watching 2.0 and 2.5 plus I have to catch season 3 on either the reruns or on DVD but as far as season 1..Edward James Olmos said it best as good as the miniseries is the first season really takes off even further.  Included in the first season box set is the miniseries and some of the best surprises and jaw dropping writing and cinematography ever seen on television.  Some great guest appearances are included in season 1 introduction to regular appearances from these guests..so anyways please see this show and watch this show make television history in sci fi writing.	5.0	Re-Imagined Sci-Fi for the ages which was made for anyone	2007-03-06	4	4	0

And you are wondering when is someone going to say something different? Well nobody is because it's the truth.No need to go on reading reviews, trust me everyone says the same thing.I strongly recommend this dvd set to any wife or girlfriend as an excellent gift for a typical guy who likes dramas or scifi. Why? Because most people haven't seen the whole season because of it's horrible time slot. (Friday nights? Newsflash: People go out!)p.s.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2O8RIDCJ0H83V	Acoma	"Let me just say up front that I do not watch hardly any television. Maybe the Daily Show on Comedy Central before bed or Family Guy on Cartoon Network. The last time i scanned through television in the evening I was greeted by a slew of reality TV shows.When I seen that SCI-FI had a new version of Battlestar Galactica I tuned in to check it out. They played the original mini-series followed by the pilot...and I have been watching it ever since on Friday's 10pm EST (Also a rebroadcast at 1am EST). The main pull to watch this was memories of Battlestar Galactica on TV when I was a kid. However, I went in with an open mind and was able to appreciate what I saw. This series is storytelling. It is not about the CGI effects. I definately don't watch it just for the effects every week.TV Guide recently called it the ""Best show on Television"". On this...I whole heartedly agree. This is the only Television show I make plans to watch right now, practically everything else on TV is not worth the time to get involved in.One of the best parts about it too is you can jump right in to watch it. It is a ongoing series where each previous episode builds upon the next. However, they will do a very good brief recap of key scenes that are important to the show you are watching now. This isn't important obviously when you have the entire season on DVD, but if you start watching the latest episodes on SCI-FI channel you won't feel lost."	5.0	Television is still worth watching...	2005-08-16	31	29	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1A692B4XLFOLL	"A. Courie ""Treb"""	"I don't even watch or care for television drama (the Sopranos is the only other drama I've followed in the past 10+ years), but I love ""Battlestar Galactica.""After the Cylons (robots) wipe out almost all of humanity in a sneak attack, the ""Battlestar Galactica"" is the last remaining human warship and leads the few survivors on a search for the mythical Earth.  The television show focuses on the President of the Colonies and the military leaders aboard the Galactica.  The show has a gritty, realistic, military feel, but despite this, the show is much more than an action/military show: it expertly blends politics, morality, philosophy, and religion into its many plots and focuses on the many characters as they cope with the travails of humanity facing extinction.Season One begins with the pilot miniseries that began the show and 13 one-hour episodes.  It features great acting, excellent production quality, and brilliant intertwined and ongoing plotlines.  While it may not be true enough to ""the original"" Battlestar Galactica, it is a fantastic television show.  Watch this one, and then enjoy the remaining seasons."	5.0	Fantastic Show - From Someone Who Doesn't Watch TV	2007-07-02	2	1	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1VJU3NG5W15L4	A Customer	I never got into the original series starring Lorne Greene. It seemed like Bonanza in space, and I never could get around that.However, I gave season two a shot on the SciFi channel and I became enthralled, so I purchased season one. I needed to find out if the shows I watched on SciFi were just a fluke or whether this was a quality series.The season one set includes the original miniseries and the entire season.They have done a quality job in putting together a well thought out and intelligent series. The gist of the show is that humanity created androids called Ceylons. Forty years earlier the Ceylons revolted, and humanity fought them to a draw. Now the Ceylons have come back with a vengeance.In a blitzekrieg attack, the Ceylons wipe out virtually the entire human race, leaving sixty ships with 50,000 people scattered across space. This comes down to a battle for survival and a war of attrition.There are number of different back stories going on (e.g. the president's cancer, the challenge between military and civilian authority, the interplay between Lee, Adama and Starbuck over Zack [deceased son and lover]).This is a science fiction series that actually tackled religion intelligently. Somewhere along the line humanity moved into pantheist worship that appears to honor a Zodiac number of Gods, where the Ceylons worship a single God. There is also the quest for earth, a lost or mythical place.You just don't know where everything is headed, as pieces are slowly revealed. Also not all the action takes place in space or aboard ship. There are plenty of sequences that occur on planet surfaces.All in all, several hours of enjoyment.SO when does season two come out on DVD?	5.0	This is not your father's galactica	2005-10-08	24	23	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1HIZC2BJYEY5P	"Adam Davis ""Adam Gone Wild"""	The show is stellar, but the packaging is quirky and oddly difficult to navigate (you have to screw and unscrew the HD-DVDs from rubber stoppers).  Audio is good, but as previously stated, the transfer overly enhances the sharpness of the source material so much that it looks super grainy; like 300-caliber grainy.  Releases like Heroes Season 1 in HD destroy the picture quality of this release, and it's sad because the show is awesome.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3300SFI0JF7OM	Adamtron	"The new series took everything that was cool about the original series and tossed it out the window.  Gone is the great opening theme music that got you excited and ready to watch the show.  Gone are the cool suede warrior jackets.  Gone are the great special effects of awesome ships, dog fights and explosions.  Gone are the cool flashgun lasers.  Gone are the cool Cylon robot voices.  Instead we have ambient ""music"" (and I use the term loosely) that opens the show.  Boring costumes.  Lame CGI effects.  Edward James Olmos is not exactly easy on the eyes.  The robot Cylon's don't talk.  They have switched the genders of the characters- Starbuck is no longer a cigar smoking ladies man, he's now a woman!  What's so sad is that the younger generation is eating this up like it's so great and they have no idea what they're missing.  Some people may say to get over it and move on, but it's hard to do when you've experienced greatness and then get handed trash.  Every month the new show continues, I keep thinking about what a wasted opportunity this was.  They should have brought back some of the original actors, (which were available and ready to work) mixed them with a new cast and furthered the epic saga in the original style."	1.0	A Shameful  Abomination Of The Original series	2005-08-23	129	24	105

This does not seem to be the fault of Amazon as my set was securely packaged.  In addition to the scratches, the Dolby TrueHD audio track on disk 2 is very noticeably out of sync with the picture.  Since the problem only appears on that disk, it probably has something to do with the encoding.  Hold off buying these and see if Universal corrects these problems.

I didn't like Battlestar when it was on (you know where you can stick your ""Fifth Cylon"", guys!?), and then I watched it from the top, and I now stand corrected. I admit it.The acting is wonderful (Olmos!). The characters are great, even ones like Helo who seem cookie-cutter but have a cool amount of depth. The effects are great. The cinematography is gritty and original. Even the soundtrack (kind of a world music, flute-y sound) is hauntingly beautiful. Basically, everything is unique and involving. I never watched the old series but I still like how they reference the ""first Cylon war"" in the miniseries, which kinds of makes it a psuedo-continuation. Nice.My main complaint is the same though:  the human Cylons are a lame idea. Somehow, this attempt to give a ""face"" to the faceless robots has not really worked out. The human Cylons are more or less clones, and there's never any exposition provided on HOW they are different from people or what they can do. It's all very underwhelming, and from what I recall, it stays that way throughout. Oh well, no show is flawless."	5.0	I was skeptical, but...	2009-04-20	1	1	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1CE1Z8NPODBG6	AftrBrnr	First, I have to chime in on what many here have already said: the reimagined BSG is, IMHO, the best show on tv. Despite it's sci-fi setting, it's a brilliantly written, produced and portrayed drama that breathes some much needed life into the genre in particular and tv in general.As to the 5 disc set - it's worth buying. Let me clarify - I already owned all of season-one from HDTV conversions to DVD and the quality was excellent. Not noticably better or worse than the store-bought disks. But the extras, quality packaging, interviews etc... make this set well worth the cost. Note: This is very much unlike the DVD standalone release of the pilot (horrid extras, dreadful quality - my HDTV conversions were better) so if a previous purchase of the DVD pilot turned you off, don't let this one pass you by.One (very minor) complaint: the episodes I've watched prior to this release have all (so far) been non-US versions and the intro music is markedly different (and, IMHO) much better than the US releases. If you've been watching the non-US versions you'll miss the very climatic music you're accustomed to hearing but it's a small thing, really.	5.0	DVD Review	2005-10-12	16	15	1

But don't forget to watch the movie miniseries first before this.  And for $5 this is a great deal (the dvds are still much more than that, and downloading these from elsewhere is takes more effort than $5)This review is mostly for using the digital movie service, Amazon's Unbox, on my Tivo HD since the content of the video is already well known.I bought this to watch using my TiVO HD box but had some troubles getting it set up. There was a very long delay between buying it online and watching it on my tivo. (24hr+) I actually had to call Amazon for help - they ended up ""repushing"" the download to my Tivo. The eps did look pretty good once I finally got them all downloaded.Also, your viewing library is limited to your TiVO HDD space. I am a cheapskate who enjoys HD, so I only have the standard size tivo DVR.  So since then, this content has been auto-deleted to make room for normal recordings. I am not sure how to re-download the episodes in the Tivo UI without running the risk of paying for the episodes again. :(In general the big downside I see to this is that this content is downloaded, not streamed. This means that if you want to watch something on your Tivo, you can't watch it immediately. You have to wait for it to download onto your box. I have downloaded tv shows from iTunes before (How I Met Your Mother) and that process was much more straightforward and simple, although that was on my PC.SUMMARY:I give this 3 stars...5 for BSG awesomeness, and -4 for the overall unbox experience, but I will put in a handicap of +2 because maybe my problems were really just user-induced and I really like amazon...so I am really surprised at how much of a pain it was."	3.0	Great show, confusing service when using with Tivo	2009-09-17	0	0	0

The cameraman is in a constant seizure while taking every shot.  Some call it edgy or dedication, I call it crap.  During spacebattles they zoom in and out, IN and out, IIN and out, then you barf and ships explode offscreen and then the battle's over.2. Plot.  If you wanted Lord of the Rings of Sci-fis, this is definitely not it.  There's enough holes in the script, I'm suprised the actors can read it.  Every episode, the writers just pull something out of their butt and say: we've planned this since the beginning, to impregnate a robot.  wtf?3. Mood.  If you love Colonel O'Neill on Stargate SG-1 and all his funny quips...go watch SG1, because this dialogue is devoid of comedy.  People say: It's supposed to be dramatic and serious.  That's bull.  Anyone who's been in a real life stressful situation ESPECIALLY WAR (ask your grandparents) tell jokes out of nervousness and desperation all the time.  Personally, these colonials can stay the hell away from Earth, cause I don't want their unemotional selves near me.4. Music. Where is it?  All I hear is a constant low, changing tone in the background.  Even bad movies and shows are saved by a good orchestra every now and then.5. Special Effects. These are actually pretty good.  I think the space battles ""would"" look nice if the zoom function was broken on the computer model camera for once.6. Technology.  Basically: We're lookin at an advanced race of humans with laser guns in their fighters...then a virus takes out all the cool stuff and they're stuck with machine guns.  Yeah, I know, WWII in space.7. Politics.  Now this angers me most of all.  That the show even focuses on this aspect just makes me want to lash out and destroy my TV.  The Secretary of Education takes over the presidency and instead of heeding the Admiral's advice or at least DOING WHAT'S SMART, she does stupid, moralistic crap to protect her own butt, even when she's dying from cancer.  If this happened to any nation on Earth, we'd immediately go to martial law which would supercede a political figurehead or democratic body.  I think 12 planets being wiped out and your entire race genocided constitutes a ""national emergency"".  And one last thing: Starbuck is a loser, end of story.If you like Desperate Housewives or the West Wing, this is for you, but if you're a trekkie, a star wars fan, or any other person that enjoys good ol' fashioned sci fi: cover your eyes and hope it gets cancelled next year."	1.0	I'm suprised I didn't vomit.	2005-10-12	106	33	73

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3H67QWXB5CSV4	"Allegro100 ""allegro100"""	I get the feeling that many of the complaints here boil down into three categories:1. Fans of the original, incensed that the new Starbuck has far larger stones than Dirk Benedict's lame womanizer.2. Hardcore SF geeks who want to see more things blowing up, and less talk.3. People who watch SF shows to escape the real world, not to be reminded of it.To the first two, I say: tough. This show's brilliance lies in its characterizations, none of which are the least bit one-note or stereotyped. Every single one of these people is complex, flawed and intricately-drawn. The cocky fighter pilot with a drinking problem and a penchant for casual sex also happens to have a complicated history involving childhood trauma. The male lead spends more time working out his relationship with his father than being a stereotypical untarnished hero. This is great stuff, folks. If you want bland characters, look somewhere else. These people--and toasters--are not easily categorized, and that makes them far more interesting than the vast majority of SF/F characters.As for the latter, I understand. There are times I want to escape, too, and some things are great for that. But there are also times to think about what's happening in our own real world, and the things BSG can teach us about what's going on--terrorism, politics, the power of human grief and anger and joy--by playing out these themes in a non-real situation are important. I imagine the people who find the series boring don't go to arthouse films or read the newspaper much, either. And that's just sad, really. We all need escapism, yes, but art that can examine current events is important to get into, too.On a DVD-specific note, I love the commentaries by Ron Moore. He's brutally honest about what works and what doesn't, and why they made the choices they did for certain things. He and David Eick, both with degrees in political science, have made a unique show, and it's great to hear their perspectives.	5.0	The best show on tv	2006-02-17	8	7	1

Compared to the old Sci-fi series which it is based on, in the new series there is still the quest for Earth, the Cylons are the bad guys, the names of major characters are used and some of the ships look similar; Almost everything else in the new series is different from the old one. Initially I was a little wary about the series because of the political correctness attached to the show like Starbuck being a woman, the Cylons being previous slaves of humanity, etc but the show came off as spectacular !!! While the old series had its moments and charm, the new series is far more interesting all around.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1D676Z8ZD6BEV	Amazon Customer	"I wrote a very long review of this item earlier today but lost it in a reboot (my own error). This version is much more brief and probably not as well-written. Sorry.Anyway, to summarize, I have been a long-time fan of sci-fi, both written and televised, but only got interested in BSG long after its run. I purchased the HD-DVD version of Season 1 for less than nine dollars, so it was not much of a loss risk, and was immediately captivated by the first episode, which I understand was actually a miniseries/pilot. The video was not up to my standards for a hi-def transfer, having previously purchased ""Bourne Identity"" on DVD (which was none too shabby on my Panasonic F85 at 480p), and later, on HD-DVD (which, at 1080i, showed an amazing improvement in video resolution), and later still, on Bluray (which, at 1080p, was virtually indistinguishable from the HD-DVD version).I was not familiar with BSG's dialogue, techno babble, or names of its characters, so I was somewhat at a loss, especially with the audio and video occasionally out of sync, as some reviews have mentioned. Therefore, I depended highly on subtitles included on the first disc. I was quite distressed and irritated to find that the second disc did not even have a menu option for subtitles, even for the conclusion of the miniseries/pilot! Inexcusable. For that reason - ""once bitten, twice shy"" - I am now debating whether or not to purchase BSG on Bluray. Movie distributors should, at a minimum, give the option for English subtitles on ALL video releases.Update (2-13-2012): A further note: one of my reasons for hesitation in getting interested in BSG during its original run was the screenwriters' attempts to circumvent censoring by regularly utilizing an obvious substitution for the ""F Bomb,"" which has probably given rise to a similar practice in other television series; e.g., ""My Name is Earl,"" in which Joy popularized the well-known use of ""Oh, snap!"" as a substitute for a less acceptable expletive.Update (2-16-2012): Following up my original review (again), I must also add my discovery of messed-up HD-DVD menus. (Hopefully they are better in the Bluray versions.) There are items allowing selection of either Dolby TrueHD or standard Dolby, sometimes listing one episode with those two choices, followed by a separate listing of the next two episodes with those same two choices. Additionally, although there is no menu item allowing for subtitles beginning with Disc 2, I have found that I can, in fact, select them using my remote control. I guess the distributors thought they had to get the product out before it was actually ready, perhaps realizing that HD-DVD was obsolete so they just wanted to make a quick buck.Update (5-4-2012): I need to correct part of my original review and my update of 2-16-2012. After further exploration, I discovered that I was quite incorrect about the HD-DVD menus. In fact, I was able to scroll down further in the menus to select the audio format and the subtitle language. I had, quite literally, not seen the faint on-screen arrow at the bottom of the menu, indicating further menu items below.As a consequence, and with suitable quantities of egg on my face, I apologize for any confusion. Furthermore, I subsequently purchased (and enjoyed immensely) the entire series on Blu-ray."	3.0	Captivating...with some caveats	2012-02-13	1	0	1

It is one of the best written shows on television right now, the plot is gripping, and the chcracters are much grittier and more realistic than on many other utopian sci-fi shows. I have seen it dubbed ""The Sci-fi series for people who hate sci-fi"" by at least one critic.The show is not affraid to examine many contemporary issues in the guise of fiction, and it shies away from easy answers. Although there are villians and antagonists throughout, one of the most endearing features of the show is the way these roles can change and shift over time. There are certainly times when the viewer is not sure who is right and who they want to win. There are no classic heroes or villians, although characteristics of both are certainly present in abundance in some characters. It's this dystopian view that keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled, and always wanting more."	5.0	one of the best Sci-Fi shows of the current era	2006-12-26	3	1	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2BZLK7CUE3Q7G	Amazon Customer	"When Amazon asks us for customer reviews, they are asking us for reviews not of the show alone, but of this particular offering: this show's presentation on this DVD set.  As such, my review is tempered.  Were I able to rank this offering solely and merely on its content, five stars would not be sufficient.  I strongly believe that this is perhaps one of the finest -- and possibly THE finest -- of all the various shows that have hit the airwaves within the last few years.  Ron Moore's writing is taut and gripping, the acting is first-rate, touches of humor abound, and human relationships take center stage, even amongst those inhuman, despite spectacular eye candy (and candy of both the CGI and slinky kind!).That all having been strongly emphasized first, the mercenary rate at which NBC/Universal Studios has chosen to price its Battlestar Galactica offerings simply cannot be ignored.  Season 1 was only 13 episodes, yet it was priced at $60.  The two individual half-season offerings are only 10 episodes each, yet they're priced at $50.  That works out to $4.61 an episode for season one, $4.99 an episode for seasons ""2.0"" and ""2.5.""  For comparative purposes, a comparable hit, ""Lost"", offered its 24-episode second season for $60, which is half that: $2.50 an episode.This product would easily receive five stars were it only to be priced at a rate designed to be equal to those offered for other television seasons.  As it stands, charging full price for half-content is an act extremely insulting for a show that has received such emphatic and enthusiastic support, and NBC/Universal Studios should behave better; the review is thus downgraded accordingly.  I would, in fact, downgrade it to a single star, except that I cannot bear to go on record as having given this fine series such a low rating.  I would gladly rate this a full five stars were the season offered for a price reasonable for a 13-episode season (say in the $30-35 range); as it is, charging a $60 list price for a 13-episode first season, or a combined $100 list price for a 20-episode second season, even one this good, can only be termed massive gluttony and avarice on NBC/Universal's part."	2.0	A fantastic show -- but you can't look past charging double!	2006-12-22	22	16	6
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AAKZ8IN9HDL9X	Amazon Customer	"I sat down to watch this show with an open mind; I could feel my brain cells turning to mush as the pictures moved across the screen in front of me and some of the lamest dialogue of the twenty-first century came out of my speakers.I have to say, as a longstanding fan of sci-fi, that this is one of the most craptacular pieces of sci-fi filler that I have ever borne witness to.It appears that the powers-that-be robbed the ill-fated Space: Above and Beyond series blind: Helmets, fightercraft and enemies that seem to have been ""borrowed"" in whole cloth.  It is extremely sad that the quality of writing and acting of S:AAB were not similarly transferred over to this nasty piece of anti-art.I can only assume that the casting agent was out sick, so they simply hired the first hundred zombies that found their way to the casting location.  As this show is essentially sleazy cable porn in a sci-fi setting, the casting couch would have been a legitimate casting medium for this rancid garbage-fest and might also explain the far-below-average acting ability of the people in this festering dog-show.  Actually, I would probably go so far as to say that these actors are the ones who couldn't get into real porn films because their acting abilities were considered too stunted even for that genre.This isn't a remagination, this is an unimagination.  Yes, the original show was in some ways cheesy, but this new regurgitation has gone from cheesy to sleazy.  Adopting every cliche possible doesn't make this show any more interesting, or even bearable.I'm alarmed and shocked that this reimagination has gained an average of 4 stars; I would hate to see what these reviewers consider to be a below-average show, but with the general lousiness of sci-fi over the last decade, I guess something has to float to the top of the swamp."	1.0	Galactica 90210	2006-02-12	95	24	71

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3KOCVDQ5R3K0S	Amazon Customer	As many others do, I consider this one of the best shows on tv.  The acting, special effects, writing, and sets are all great.  I want to address some things other raters have pointed out, though.1)  I did not grow up watching the original series, but I have seen a few episodes on tv every now and then.  From what I have seen, the acting was bad, the script was bad, the special effects were laughable, and the Cylons were ridiculous.  The new series is much, much more serious.  As such, it has a much darker tone, and the characters are not constantly making jokes.2)  Throughout the show, not just season 1, humanity is in a very bleak situation.  Going along with that, the futuristic stuff isn't all shiny, a la Star Trek.  In fact, it is shown to be rather pedestrian, mainly just functional.  Since the show isn't about countless alien races and stuff like that, things are not meant to look too foreign to us.3)  The acting is superb.  True, the characters may seem one dimensional at first, but that is what makes the show so successful.  Their character storylines continue throughout.  Heck, in season 3, they are still developing the characters.  They are anything but one dimensional.  Since the show has a continuity line throughout each episode, the characters may in fact seem one dimensional if you only watch one episode.  That is why you cannot just watch an episode whenever you feel like, as you can do with Star Trek.4)  Plus, the show is just bada**.  Never have I seen any show that is so intriguing and has such a myriad of congruent plotlines.	5.0	Thoughts on BSG	2007-05-15	3	3	0

Get over it! This is NOT the '70's BSG and thank god for that. I too was a fan of the original when it was on, I was 10 in 1978 though, what is everyone else's excuse?Yeah that's derogatory but if everyone took an honest (not nostalgic) look at the original I think you'd all admit that it was pretty terrible (a few months before the remake began Sci-Fi channel ran the original, I looked forward to watching it and I was shocked that I ever thought it was good). ""Cheesy"" is being too kind when referencing the orginal Battlestar.This new show is NOT cheesy, it is anything but. It is intense drama and the BEST show on television today. Notice I did not call it the best ""sci-fi"" show. It contains all the things that are missing in bad sci-fi; real human interaction, powerful drama, political intrique, religious and philosophical arguments, great acting and so much more.The technology is realistic, no transporter beams or replicators. There are even bathrooms, the ships need fuel to run and one of the fleet's priorities is maintaining a supply of food and water.One of the best things about this show is that unlike ever other sci-fi show except Babylon 5 (another favorite of mine) is that every episode doesn't reset at the ending. In any of the Star Trek shows that have been on for the most part no matter what happened in an episode things were ""back to normal"" at the end (minus the occasional 2 parter). You could miss ten eps and it didn't matter. This is true of most television but sci-fi especially (again, B5 was the exception, the fact that it was the only ongoing series that I know of that was MEANT to end after five years allowed the show to change radically as it went on). Not so in BSG, things happen that have REAL consequences for the characters.It is a dark show, the story involves the extermination of the human race minus 40,000 some survivors, not a lot light there. It is adult, the characters are ""real"" people not cardboard cutours, they drink, swear (the explictive ""frack"" is one of the holdovers from the original) and have sex. This isn't for kids, there are no bug-eyed monsters.If you normally disdain sci-fi because you mistakingly think of it as a ""kid's genre"" take a look at this show anyway, you may be surprised. It has many of the elements you'd see in episodes of NYPD Blue, West Wing, 24, Alias and Lost but is so much better than all of them (I speak as a fan of most of those shows too, I can't stomach the liberal whining of West Wing though). Don't think that because it isn't on a major network or HBO that it has low-end production values either. The ships and environments look real, not the white-washed sterility of Star Trek or Star Wars, more the practical, lived-in look of ALIEN.Whether you loved, hated or never saw the original it doesn't matter, give this show a viewing.Battlestar Galactica is the best sci-fi since Babylon 5 and one of the best shows made, period."	5.0	One of the best TV shows ever!	2005-08-06	48	40	8

If you're looking for thought-provoking and intense human drama with complex, realistic characters, you can't top Battlestar Galactica. If you just want non-stop comedy, you should look elsewhere. I don't mean to impy there is NO comedy at all in Battlestar. The 9th episode is very funny, and James Callis is a hoot in his role as Gaius Baltar. But expecting a LOT of comedy is unfair; it would not make sense in a show with Battlestar's storyline.	5.0	Excellent drama	2005-10-31	9	7	2

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A928WN8NV03WZ	"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy"""	"Though this show doesn't really follow the original except in concept, it is actually well done and believable for the subject material.This series follows right after the decision in the miniseries to try to reunite themeslves with the lost colony(Earth), which might be the last human society left in the galaxy.  The cylons are chasing them, and have made it known that they consider it more than just succeding their masters, they look at it as a holy mission.The season starts out with the very tense episode ""33"".  So named because after the fleet sets out on its journey, the cylons start attacking, but they attack every 33 minutues precisely.  It gives a look into a life of a millitary that is on the edge of breaking.  No one has slept in days, pilots are required to take stims to keep their edge, people have a foggy far away look, and tempers are frayed.  Other episodes of note are Bastille day where they bring back a member of the original series as a Nelson Mandella type character, 6 degrees of seperation shows the growing madness and desperation of Baltar, the Hand of God where in desperate need for fuel they attack a Cylon refinery and we get some gratuitous action, or the season finale Kobol's Last Gleaming.All in all this show impressed me for the plain and simple quality of the production.  The actors fit their characters, the FX is gritty and farily realistic, they convey a sense of desperation well, and they create an interesting storyline.  It can get a bit melodramatic, but when you think that these are a group of people that survived the apocolypse of not only their home planet, but every known human civilization except for a mythical lost colony.  They also convincingly give the clausterphobic feel of what it must be like to be trapped in a ship.  As well the feeling of general distrust and paranoia when it is revealed the cylons look like people.This show isn't for everyone.  It is for those who like sci fi dramas, i.e. babylon 5, deep space nine, etc....  Fans of the original show might be dissapointed at all the changes that they have made.  Ones that I have known say it follows the original in premise and plot to a lesser degree. But most agree, it is a good show on its own."	5.0	different show, but good on its own	2006-03-29	5	3	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1GQ7AFCN7OZMK	amster	When I watched the original mini-series a year or so ago, I gave it a pretty harsh review (...not you father's battlestar galactica...).  I was annoyed that they had made so many radical changes to the show I grew up with (like making Starbuck a woman).  Well, I decided to give it another chance and watch the first season. Now that I see where the series is going, all I can say is, I was wrong.This show is not your father's Battlestar Galactica.  Its superior in almost every way.  The Cylons are infinately more evil and cunning than in the original series.  Take for instance the not so subtle references to religious fanaticism in their portrayal.  Brilliant.  Its what sci-fi is supposed to be; a commentary on the modern world that we live in.In my opinion, its the best drama on television.	4.0	I was wrong...	2005-07-26	40	35	5
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2EQM0P51VXDKY	Amy A.	"Please ignore the individuals who keep bashing the show. They're either fans of the original Battlestar Galactica series, fans of other sci-fi shows who are jealous of all the critical love this show receives, or people who are just unable to recognize quality.The simple fact is, this show would not have been named""THE BEST SHOW ON TV"" by Newsday,""ONE OF THE TOP SIX DRAMAS ON TV"" by Time Magazine,""THE BEST SHOW ON TV"" by The Christian Science Monitor, and""THE BEST DRAMA OF THE 2004-2005 SEASON"" by the staff of Television Without Pityif it's as bad as the bashers on Amazon claim.This new version of Battlestar Galactica is one of the most intelligent shows in years. It has outstanding character development, gripping action, and careful plotting. Even people who are not fans of sci-fi will love this show because it is very character driven.In response to Sharonda B. above:You're right that TV Without Pity sometimes gives individual episodes of the O.C. higher ratings than Battlestar Galactica episodes. That's because it is ONE reviewer deciding on the rating and he/she or she is not directly comparing the two shows.When the staff of TV Without Pity decide the winners of their annual awards, that is the opinion of MANY TV critics who are DIRECTLY COMPARING all the shows on TV. They determined that Battlestar Galactica was the best (tied with Deadwood).TV Without Pity also allows visitors to give their ratings. Sometimes visitors give higher rating to The O.C. eps than Battlestar Galactica eps. If you prefer to rely on their ratings, that's your prerogative but I'd bet that most of these people don't watch both shows so the relative ratings are unlikely to be an accurate comparison."	5.0	Critically acclaimed show	2005-08-19	37	34	3

It's plot is deep and addictive, and if you're even remotely interested in Sci-Fi, pick this one up. However, if you're a fan of the original, be wary of a few major changes.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1EVD37ULFNOKU	"Andrew Frankel ""Huge movie collector"""	I was a late BSG fan, so late, that I started it only after much persuasion from a scifi friend. I was unemployed and had nothing but time to devote to the entire series, which was completely on dvd when I started (just emphasizing late BSG person). I watched the miniseries first of course, and I have to say I wasn't too sure what I was getting myself into. They were ok, but I wasn't fully paying complete attention while they were on and I had just finished the Farscape legacy a week before, so I think I was a bit sci-fi'd out. Then I started the pilot episode 33 a couple weeks after watching the miniseries, again my fault for starting this series after just finishing another. The pilot episode started what I would later call my Extraction from Humanity of 2010. The series is like a plague, the writing is fantastic, the characters are really developed, and the actors are amazing. I would watch one episode after another after another. I started talking like them, you will be surprised when FRAK accidentally slips out of your mouth when you are with people, but luckily, most know exactly what FRAK is and may become a conversation starter. Don't even get me started on So Say We All. I can't stress enough how really amazing this series is, I would love to talk about it in depth here, but I won't give any spoilers, and to be honest with a series like this, you really want to go into it fresh. I had no idea what the story was when I started and I just got sucked in. My friend told me about as much as I am telling you that inevitably got me to watch the series, so I hope it persuades you to do the same.My only problem now is when I completed the whole series, the miniseries disc vanished, and I would have liked to go back and watch them over again, so I am now purchasing the first season again; hence the review.	5.0	Be Careful once you start, you can't stop.	2011-01-06	1	1	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3HLXNCQGTW187	ANDREW J. GERO Jr.	I'm not one to get involved in any of the SciFi Channel's Series since the inception of said channel.  I usually find the special effects less that wonderful, or on the flip side, all the show had to offer.  I was familiar with the original Battlestar Gallactica, and considered it outrageous camp, complete with bad acting, and two dimensional characters.  However a friend of mine insisted that I sit and watch the opening miniseries, and with a great deal of angst I sat down and watched it.  In all honesty, I had my socks completely knocked off.  I promptly went out and bought season 1 and 2 and watched them non stop.  As so many people before me have stated, it is, in reality, a gripping, character driven drama, that just happens to take place in outer space.  The writing is brilliant in that they manage to make me empathize with one of the Cylons, (The Bad Guys).  The Cylons are truly villanious, and to make the viewer care for even one of them is quite a feat.  If you are like I am, and have a few misgivings, give yourself a treat and watch the miniseries,  I recommend that you start at the beginning because the show is not episodic.  I can't wait for the next DVD to be released.	5.0	The Best SciFi/Drama Television Show in Years!	2006-04-07	4	3	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"Battlestar Galactica is a story of genocide.  Man created machines.  The machines rebelled.  Now, humanity has been reduced from its population of billions down to a mere 50,000 survivors.  Under the leadership of the newly appointed president (and recently diagnosed cancer patient) Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) and protected by the Battlestar Galactica under the command of Commander William ""Husker"" Adama (Edward James Olmos) the starfleet containing the last humans in the solar system must flee and find the legendary planet Earth.The mini-series (which is basically an extended pilot to the series) is about the very short war between the humans of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol and the Cylons (my full review of the miniseries can be found on the page for the Battlestar Galactica Mini-series).  The people of the 12 Colonies (each with a name that is a derivative of zodiac signs) had fought the Cylons before, when the Cylons looked like large chrome robots.  Now, however, the Cylons had adapted to human form.  One particular model, Number Six (Tricia Helfer), was able to trick Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis), one of the brightest and most well-connected human, into allowing her access to the defense mainframe which made the cylons' new sneak attack possible.  After getting the remaining ships together, Adama ordered a faster-than-light jump out of the solar system, and told the fleet that they would be seeking out the legendary 13th Colony; Earth.If losing most of humanity and having to leave their homes wasn't bad enough, things just continue to get worse for the humans once the series begins.  They soon learn that some cylons are programmed to believe that they are human, making them the perfect sleeper agents in the fleet.  One such agent is Lt. Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii (Grace Park), who, early on, destroys most of the fleet's water supply.  Furthermore, her relationship with Crew Chief Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) complicates matters due to an order to stop seeing each other.  They disregard it, and when Boomer inadvertantly causes disasters due to her programming, Tyrol looks the other way and covers for her.  Meanwhile, pilots for the Viper starfighters are becoming scarce, and Lt. Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) is forced to teach flight school to a bunch of inexperienced and unprepared teenagers.  If that weren't bad enough, Starbuck has many personal problems (such as insubordination) as well as concern over teaching the new pilots based on a mistake in her past.Starbuck isn't the only crew member with problems.  The Executive Officer, Col. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) has alcohol issues, and, towards the end of the season, has to deal with his unfaithful wife.  Commander Adama's son Capt. Lee ""Apollo"" Adama (Jamie Bamber) has just become the lead pilot on Galactica, and is unable to do what is necessary to truly lead.  Plus, he and his father are still going through a small fight that was caused when Apollo's brother Zak died (although, this is mostly resolved in the mini-series).  Baltar is seeing Six whereever he goes due to (supposedly) a microchip planted in his brain by the cylon.  Six's image tells him to do certain things that, if followed, keep him safe as well as cause good things to happen to him.  If Baltar refuses, misfortune usually comes his way.  Six is using the doc as a pawn in the cylons' master plan.  Further complications are caused by Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch, of the original Battlestar Galactica), a man imprisoned for terrorism.  He is a man with a definite, yet unknown, political agenda who will stop at nothing to get Roslin out of office.  Finally, there is Karl ""Helo"" Agathon, who was stranded on the colony of Caprica in the mini-series.  Unable to return to the fleet, he meets up with another copy of the Boomer cylon, and thinking her to have come back from Galactica to rescue him, embarks on a journey with her that has some unexpected results.Battlestar Galactica is probably the best show I've ever seen on the Sci Fi channel.  Its stories are very compelling and very real, even though this show takes place on a space ship and involves killer robots.  It is strange how shows like this (or even Buffy and Angel, which also deal with sci-fi/fantasy concepts) can be more real that shows that don't have such elements.  The acting is good.  It is not amazing, but it is not so bad that it takes away from the show.  I'd say it's pretty normal; none of the actors are going to win any Emmys (although it's very rare for a genre show to win Emmys that aren't in special effects categories), but it is leagues ahead of a lot of other shows on the Sci Fi Channel (even shows that I like, such as the Stargate shows).  Speaking of special effects, this show excels in them.  Using the same company that did the effects for the show Firefly, and the upcoming movie spin-off, Serenity, things look beautiful.  The ships, the Cylon Centurions, the dogfight sequences are all very well done.  Another great thing (that was also borrowed from Firefly) is the ""shaky cam"" movements that make it seem as if someone actually took a camera and filmed the ships flying around in space.The mini-series is great, and the series is even better.  If you haven't checked this show out yet, you should seriously consider it.  If you are a sci-fi fan, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching this.  If you aren't, I still suggest this show.  As I said earlier, this is a very real, very human story.  While it does require a little more suspension of disbelief than the average drama, it is more a drama than a sci-fi show, and it is one of the best dramas I have ever seen."	5.0	Earthbound	2005-07-22	23	16	7

The humans are trying to fing Earth.Those are just a fraction of all the emmy-worthy things in BSG.

The religion and politics in the show keep me guessing as to what it's advocating, if anything, and if the show creators think it would be applicable for today. Sounds geekish, I know, I am THAT into it. This show is not science and technology oriented at all, and some people might complain about the seeming lack of dazzling technological concepts here. This show is very fast paced, and it seems like every single sub plot grabs my attention - for me personally, there are no groaner plot lines, or amazingly even groaner events! The only one is where someone says they are a crack rifle shot and the rifle has a laser pointer on the top of it. See! I have to get that specific to find something stupid!

I was young and those Viper fighters were so cool -- I didn't really pay much attention when the SciFi Network revived ""Battlestar Galactica"" several years ago.

The new ""Battlestar Galactica"" is one of the most intense and compelling television dramas I have ever watched.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AE7EQ5123M75T	a writer/reader/listener	"I have brooded a long time about how to write a review of the remake of Battlestar Galactica. The problem is that I can't say enough good things about it to do it justice. This is without a doubt the finest science fiction (and some of the finest action/drama) ever to come to the screen, big or small. As a devotee of the original, I was leery when I heard of the plans for the remake (especially when I learned that Starbuck was gonna be a GIRL!). But the remake utterly eclipses the original even while paying it an undeniable and thorough homage.Battlestar Galactica has great action, a strong and extremely realistic military undertone, and an earnestness, grit, and extraordinary attention to detail  that make most other science fiction shows seem contrived and plastic. And that's only the beginning. Good science fiction goes beyond the technology and wrestles with basic human/philosophical issues. Battlestar Galactica does so more than any prior SF series (including earlier ""intelligent"" SF such as the original series of Star Trek and the more recent Babylon 5). But rather than doing so in some abstract, preachy way--such as having the actors all stand around at the end of a show reflecting on what they've learned in the past hour and lecturing about the nature of life, the universe, and everything--the BSG remake weaves these issues into the marrow of the drama and the action. What does it mean to be human? How does (and should) a society govern itself? What is the nature of God, assuming God exists? What is the nature of good, and of evil? The series explores all of these in utterly gripping ways, through intense character development and conflict and through literally edge-of-your-seat action and combat sequences.As just one of many possible examples, in dealing with the nature of humanity, the series posits that the Cylons--intelligent machines constructed by (and now apparently bent on destroying) the human race--have evolved into models that are practically indistinguishable from humans (and even able to interbreed with them). So when humans capture a Cylon who can easily pass the Turing test and gives every evidence of feeling fear and pain, can they justly torture it to get information? If the Cylon is a female model, may they justly rape it as part of that torture? As one character tells another ""You can't rape a machine,"" yet is the bleeding, traumatized ""woman"" being interrogated truly a machine? The philosophical questions aren't abstract--they are played out in a gritty battle for human survival.Another very welcome dimension to this show is religion. One can go through all of the various Star Trek series (for example) and hear almost no mention of religion as an important motivator in individuals or societies, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of real-life humans profess to believe in God(s), and many humans throughout history have shown a great willingness to go so far as to kill or die for their beliefs. BSG acknowledges this religious dimension: The humans are polytheists, while the Cylons are equally sincere monotheists, believing that they are doing their god's will (which apparently includes the murder of billions of humans). And, also true to life, some characters, both human and Cylon, are more religious and/or moral than others, making religion play a realistically complex role in the drama.If this sounds too ""intellectual"" for you, don't be turned off, for the drama and action predominate in this show, and they are both gripping. On several occasions when I watched this show and came to the end of an episode, the cliffhanger (action or dramatic) was so visceral that I simply could not stop but HAD to watch the next immediately. The characters are all superbly drawn and acted, and there are so many relationships I can't begin to get into them here. There isn't a weak character or performance to be found in the large slate. Bill Adama, The gruff commander; Laura Rosslyn,  the inexperienced but resolute president; Saul Tigh, the alcoholic executive officer who's uncertain of himself; Lee Adama (call sign Apollo) the young pilot and his tense relationship with his father (who is also his commander); Boomer, the Cylon who is also apparently a human pilot and having an identity crisis; and Starbuck, a particularly complex and well-played character. One of the most absorbing characters is Dr. Gaius Baltar, who is not so simply drawn as to be a villain. He's selfish and oversexed, and he has constant visions of the Cylon who used him to compromise the human defense network, but while he's totally self-serving, to call him evil is to be simplistic; he's far more nuanced than that. James Callis as Baltar is by turns sinister, tragic, and wildly comic. Even Richard Hatch, the original Apollo, shines in his recurring guest role, a far more mature and accomplished actor than he was in the 1970s.I could go on, but to no avail. All the descriptions are bound to fall short. Watch this show--even, or rather especially, if you aren't into science fiction. You will NOT be disappointed."	5.0	One of the best shows, science fiction or not, ever to hit the screen	2008-01-26	6	5	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A156EO06B08ZL3	"Barbara Morrissey ""spiritkittykat"""	I have to say that this show exceeded my expectations. When I first saw an ad for the mini-series I was thought it looked interesting but I thought that, like most shows on Sci-Fi, the most I could hope for was some fun camp. I was wrong. I watched it and thought that it was fresh and unique. The acting is great, the directing is great and the way they use different styles of cinematography is also great.The writers used different topics that they meld together very well. The human/Cylon clash that results in the almost total annililation of the human race, religious aspects, and messages of hope of finding the birthplace of humanity, Earth, are all storylines that keep me coming back for more.If you are a fan of Science Fiction than this will be great for you. If you are a fan of the original than please don't rule this show out. It is not a refilming of the original, it is a whole new ballgame. Starbuck being a woman and Boomer being a woman make their storylines fresh and endless.I recommend picking up both editions (U.K. and U.S.), if you love this show and, like me, were unable to wait till September to watch the first season again.	5.0	Battlestar is Great	2005-08-20	25	22	3

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	"I grew up on the original Battlestar Galactica, but even as a kid, I knew I was being pandered to with robot dogs and flying motorcycles and a cute kid hanging around on a military ship.But the premise -- robots all but wipe out humans elsewhere in the galaxy, and a ragtag fugitive fleet makes its way towards the semi-mythical Earth while pursued by the relentless Cylons -- was sound.Jump forward to 2004, and the new incarnation of the series. Most of the characters are reimagined, even if they fit into the same general niches -- two of them are even women now -- and the entire affair takes itself much more seriously. No robot dogs wrestling cute kids on the floor of a military cruiser here.Likewise, the special effects are a major leap forward and the dogfights in space are shot in bar-raising documentary style fashion, making them feel much more immediate and dangerous.The tweaks to the Cylons, both toasters and a new series that look like humans, make them much more interesting and frightening, and the changes to their human collaborator make him more than a joke. (Although Baltar is still a joke, much of the time.)The acting, especially by Edward James Olmos and Grace Park, is also miles beyond the original cast (although the original Apollo has a recurring role in the new series, playing very much against type).But ...(You knew there'd be a ""but,"" didn't you?)But the writing is sloppy at times to the point of carelessness. I'm not one to nitpick minor details like the names of characters' never-seen parents or what have you (although it'd be nice if all the characters stopped calling the NCO ""sir""), but major plot points appear and disappear out of the ether.At the end of the miniseries (included in this DVD package), Commander Adama receives a note in his quarters stating that Cylons look like humans now, and noting how many models there are. Who left this note? How did they know the information and why share it with him? And, most importantly, why wasn't this ever followed up on?Likewise, the Cylon plot doesn't appear to make much sense, nor does some unseen Cylon infiltrator placing a key clue on the bridge of the Galactica to be found make much sense either.(I'm also not a fan of alien humans wearing neckties and a Caprica that looks an awful lot like contemporary America/Canada, but I get they had to save money somewhere in the production process.)But the good outweighs the bad, and the whole affair is carried off with such style that it would be a huge shame for any space opera fan to not give it a try, just to see if a BSG without robot dogs is for them.Strongly recommended to fans of the original and to those looking for a more gritty alternative to the relentlessly utopian Star Trek franchise."	4.0	Lots of fun, but sometimes marred by sloppy writing	2006-06-09	7	2	5

There are episodes where every civilian is wearing a necktie and a suit, as if this was taking place on Earth!StarBuck drives around in a Hummer, American street signs, an absolute lack of any type of advanced technology. Give me a break- why would everybody dress exactly the way we do? Most scenes that take place on a planet,look exactly like they are taking place on Earth. There is nothing alien about the surroundings at all. They never show an extra moon in the sky or alien life, etc. This series shows absolutely none of the attention to detail that made Star Trek a classic sci-fi series. Its has none of the exotic feel that I look for in sci-fi. The Cylons appear as totally human looking and act like humans- there is nothing spooky, unusual or mystifying about them at all- what is the point of that? In fact, one of the main Cylons is a cute Asian girl, who may as well have on The Apprentice or the OC, she seems and acts totally normal! Adama speaks in a constant mumbling monotone and shows absolutely no emotion ever. The President is played by a whiny neurotic woman who has absolutely no ""presence"" when compared to other actors who have played Presidents on other shows. The Battlestar Galactica is a dreary worn out ugly ship, with absolutely no indication itpossesses any advanced technology. They speak to one another with big blocky old style wired telephones! Wouldn't a starship have at least cellular phone technology?? The list can go on & on. The Balter gimmick is silly- he is constantly talking to a beautiful Cylon women only he can see. Again, the same problem- what is Cylon about her? She is just another ordinary annoying woman- there is nothing alien about her! Also, how about an explanation of how the Cylons came to be & how they became independent- there is no history with respect to this at all."	1.0	This Reincarnation is Extremely Bland	2006-01-14	74	17	57
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A4GOHQ0EXX8C3	Benjamin Guilfoy	"Now in its second season, Sci-Fi's ""Battlestar Galactica"" is getting heaps of praise from critics everywhere, including USA Today, TV Guide, and The New York Times.  It is the Sci-Fi Channel's highest rated program.The show is the story of 50,000 survivors of the human race, on the run from a race of evil robots called the Cylons.  Although set in space, BSG uses characters and stories that could easily exist in contemporary shows.  Themes of religious fanaticism, paranoia, suicide bombers and every other horror our world faces today are presented in a tense, dramatic show that easily bests the cheesy 1970s original.The new ""Battlestar Galactica"" has already succeeded the original, which lasted merely a season in the late 1970s.  The new show ditches all of the cheese and sets up a realistic, gritty portrayal of a group of survivors on the run and fighting for their lives.It's the brainchild of Ron Moore, veteran of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"", and stars Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell as the two remaining leaders of humanity who butt heads over how to survive and where to run.A highly recommended, highly exciting series."	5.0	A great new show!	2005-07-26	30	26	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2B4GW5A7RUQU7	B	After re-watching the original BG movie I'm left feeling like it was just a blueprint for this amazing new version of the story. I was really put off by the obvious sexism displayed in the original - one of the original TV series' episodes features a storyline in which the 'male' pilots are struck ill and so 'females' are trained to become pilots. Any female character in the original was mainly a weak damsel in distress, there to be arm candy for one of the male leading roles. I've found that the new Starbuck is immensely more filled out and likeable/hateable of a character than the original, and in fact all of the characters in this new version are more real and personable. And the distribution of female/ethnic roles is much more realistic and much less irritating/discriminatory. Also, the original is a complete Star Wars rip off -  the costumes (robes, Darth-like helmets, cloaks), robots, sound effects, aliens, and basic plot aspects - while the new series sways directly away from such copy-catting and dives off in its own direction.As for the story in this version, it does seem as if the original was just a rough outline for this attempt. There is a much broader and more meaty description of the culture and history of the characters and their struggles, including their fued with the Cylons.All in all this BG series is beatiful and emotional and physical and so insightful into the Human condition. Its also rough and violent and gritty and again, so human. The special effects are fantastic, the sets are super realistic, and the acting is fabulous.I would recommend this series to drama fans, war film fans, sci-fi fans, love story fans, fantasy fans, action-adventure fans, and everyone in between. One of the best thought-out, put-together, and visually and mentally stunning shows on television, not just currently, but ever.	5.0	Amazingly Beautiful Redux	2006-07-31	7	4	3

A friend of mine, however, persuaded me to have a look at BSG's Season One DVDs.  After viewing Disk One (Disk One is the miniseries that spawned the series - the remaining 4 disks are Season One of the series), I went out and bought the DVDs for myself.Probably everything I'm going to say has been said in the 500+ reviews before this one.  Nevertheless, let me say that this looks to be one of the best shows ever on TV.  From the writing and acting, to the cinematography and editing, to the special effects, to even the titling, this is a great show.  Hollywood can learn a lesson here, namely that big budgets and big stars do not equal quality viewing.There's something here for everyone, human drama, social commentary, politics, action, romance.  Maybe that's what good sci-fi is all about - contemporary views from a futuristic viewpoint?  Anyway, count me as a new fan of BSG.

But here is the exact quote:""BSG tells us more than Fox or CNN about why we are in Iraq and Afganistan."" He's not saying that those wars are irrelevent, far from it. They are very important. But it's the crappy nature of CNN's (and especially Fox's) coverage that is in question.I feel it is very important to keep an eye on current events. However, most TV news does a poor job at that. It portrays things in black and white (in glorious HD color!), but doesn't explore the real issues/causes beneath the BS that the government's and corporations' words. BSG shows us many subtleties of human nature. Everyone has good and bad in him, no issue is simple, especially good vs. bad.Enough of defending that guy.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E	B. Martin	"To say that Battlestar Galactica's first season is all over the place, is a bit of an understatement.  By the final episode  I wasn't sure exactly what the focus of the series was or where it was heading.  Still, I have to admit that I am definitely interested in seeing how things play out.  The series follows the remaining members of the human race (approximately 50,000 souls) as they search for a new home after the twelve colonies that they inhabited are destroyed and overtaken by a race of supremely advanced machines called Cylons.  The mini-series that launched the series is included in season one and it serves as a prologue to the events that take place.  It explains who and what the Cylons are and chronicles the events leading up to their attack on the human race.Once the story has been set up and all of the major players introduced, BSG gets off to a stellar start with its first five episodes which find the fleet of surviving humans running from Cylon pursuers, appointing a president (Mary McDonnell) to keep some form of goverment intact, searching for a source of water and dealing with a political uprising.  All the while, themes of faith and the very nature of humanity are explored.But after those first five episodes, things start to spin out of control.  Onerheated melodrama outmuscles more subtle storytelling, the show's relligiious overtones begin to get heavy handed and preachy and characters start to make increasingly aggrivating decisions (Adama brings Tai's power hungry wife on board the Galactica, Boomer and a chief mechanic put the security of the fleet at risk in an attempt to hide their affair, Adama rebels against the president because she makes a decision that he disagrees with, etc.) that seem designed to keep the drama flowing.  By the season's end, things finally start to get silly when the president begins having visions of serpents that ultimately convince her to seek out a mystical arrow that she believes will help them find the mysterious planet earth that is to be their new home.  And have I mentioned the ongoing scenes between Dr. Gayus Baltar and the cylons' leader:  a vixen known as number 6?  The cylon appears only to Dr. Baltar via a chip planted in his head.  At first the interplay between the two is compelling and has an undeniable sexual tension.  But soon, the scenes become almost laughable and the only thing that they accomplish is to make Baltar look like a complete loon.  Interestingly, despite his constant bouts of strange behavior, nobody seems to question that he is a gifted scientific mind and his loyalty to the human race is only questioned once.  It would seem to me that anyone who was paying attention would be able to figure out that there is something off with the guy and maybe he shouldn't be given such high security clearance.  But as I said earlier, it just serves to create more drama and confrontation.  And before I forget, the constant use of the word ""frack"" as a substitute for that other famous f-word is just stupid.  Anytme a character uses the word, the drama is instantly sucked out of the scene.Yet despite its numerous flaws, BSG is a unique and often compelling series.  Any show that ponders what it means to be human and wrestles with big ideas such as God and fate is worth checking out.  I just hope that the show gets itself straightened out and more focused by season 2.  I can overlook the growing pains that seem to be apparent throught this freshman season, but if they continue I'll probably end up begging for them to push me out one of the air locks."	3.0	An interesting mess	2010-08-24	7	5	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA'S first season on TV is the stuff of legends. And I don't say this lightly. Built (loosely) upon the 1978 version which suffered from subpar acting, scripts and sets, this new and phenomenally improved series gives science fiction afficionados the guts to stand up and shout, ""Science Fiction is a valid TV genre!"" Although some SF series' are pretty darn good (FARSCAPE and FIREFLY fans know what I'm talking about), this smart, sexy and twisted series puts an intellectual face on the genre and dares viewers to keep up.Set in the distant future in a distant galaxy, season one opens with the Battlestar Galactica being decommissioned in favor of larger, more modern battlestars. Cylons and humans have survived by distancing themselves with no contact taking place for over 40 years. But that's all about to change. The Cylons attack all the human settlements, planets, and military ships, nearly wiping humanity from the universe. But a rag-tag group of fighters aboard the now decommissioned Battlestar Galactica refuse to give up. The remaining 40,000-plus humans cluster their spaceships around the Galactica and flee into the void. With them comes the Secretary of Education turned President (Mary McDonnell), chief military man Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the tough but sexy super-pilot Starbuck ( Katee Sackhoff, a woman. More on that in a minute), and maybe even a couple of Cylons who now resemble humans.One of the things that makes this series so engaging is that it's sexy; the stunningly beautiful Trisha Helfer plays the first Cylon-turned-human and does so by using every excellent curve she's got. But the sex is justified as we learn it's not only a tool that the Cylon's use to gain access to human secrets, but also to help them understand what humanity's all about. We also learn that the Cylons believe in God - monotheism - while the humans have reverted to worshiping the ""Gods of Kobol"" - polytheism. And it is a clash of wills between Trisha Helfer's character and James Callis' Dr. Gaius Baltar (the local genius who has problems discerning reality from fiction) that keeps this story thread extremely interesting.Another thing that keeps the story moving ahead and each episode watchable is that the plots are completely character driven. That's not to say there's no science fiction. There is. But it's just one of the many layers that makes the series sensational. I can't picture anyone else in the role of Commander Adama besides Edward James Olmos. I can't picture anyone in the role of Starbuck other than Katee Sackhoff. The casting and acting and scripts and sets and special effects are pulled off with exceptional care but don't pander to the viewer; if you don't understand something, they aren't going to slow down and explain it to you.I'm going to have to comment, of course, on the fact that Starbuck is a woman. This caused some untempered comments by fans of the original 70s version. But I found it to be an excellent change. Having several strong female leads (Mary McDonnell, Katee, Sackhoff, Tricia Helfer, and Grace Park) added a sense of futuristic realism that was missing in the original series.There are almost too many great things about this series to comment on and I'm forced to agree with the critics on this one; it is ""The Best New Show on TV."" LOST has lost its #1 standing in my view. I'm going to be checking out Battlestar Galactica's second season very, very soon. I'm hooked."	5.0	Climb Aboard The New And Much Improved Battlestar Galactica	2006-03-13	8	4	4

The rebooted BSG is simply one of the best shows I've ever seen of any kind. I don't even know where to start.  The writing is amazing, whether referring to the dialogue or the story arc.  The special effects are stunning.  The music--oh my God, the music--is terrific. The actors are excellent and the show actually makes you think.  You don't have to be a science fiction fan to love this show.  I don't even mind the fact that I missed it when it was aired, since now I'm binge-watching it for free on Prime Instant Video.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A22BJ61UAQEHWV	Brad	"As a fan of the original Battlestar Galactica, I had my doubts about this ""re-imagining"" as did many others. The old saying goes: ""Don't knock it till you try it."" Therefore, I did. Picking up the US Season One set (which includes the miniseries) I popped in disc one.Three hours later, I was completely hooked. I popped in disc two and watched the first four episodes, then the next four on the following disc.I am totally addicted to this show. The conflicts between and within the characters themselves, the fantastic visual effects, and the writing and direction totally immerse the viewer into their universe.Olmos is brilliant as William Adama, and I truly believe he is a worthy successor to the role of Adama, originally played by the late Lorne Greene. It was good to see Richard Hatch (the original series' Apollo) back in action. He does a great job playing the reformed terrorist Tom Zarek. I was a little leery about having a female portray Starbuck at first, but I'm very glad they cast Katee Sackhoff. She really pulls off the part well. Jamie Bamber is a great new Apollo, and Mary McDonnell (no stranger to human disaster flicks--""Independence Day"") does an admirable job playing the tormented President Roslin.I have to say my personal favorite character here is Gaius Baltar, played to perfection by James Callis. He is both genius in his brilliance and extremely looney, and his interactions with the mysterious Number Six (Tricia Helfer, WOW) are funny and well-performed.I'm just now wrapping up Season One. I have not seen any episodes of Season Two yet. Looking forward to it.One thing about this series: Don't skip ANY episodes. These are not standalone episodes, to be sure. It's one continuous storyline, and missed eps can result in a degree of confusion.My recommendation? If you are a fan of Sci-fi in any way, and enjoy a good, briskly paced dramatic storyline, look no further than the new Battlestar Galactica. Pick this one up NOW."	5.0	Fracking addicting television!	2005-09-25	39	37	2

I wound up losing a bet and a friend of mine made me watch this unwatchable series.  I sat down ready to hate this saga of man creating machine who fought man by creating machines to look like man.  Its TV too so the effects have got to be laughable right?  Wrong, wrong, wrong.I was so wrong.  By the end of the mini-series discs (included in this wonderful season) I was rooting for Adama and the rest of the crew of Battlestar.  The effects were great and there are some truly amazing moments (the end of 33 is heartbreaking).  The policial intrigue which underscores a tale of survival against a foe who is not as hatable as I would prefer.Well, I can be called stubborn, but I must say that I pulled a complete 180 on this matter.  You caught me Sci-Fi; hook, line, and sinker.

I reluctantly watched the miniseries, but what I found was that I couldn't turn it off. The next day I purchased the first season of this show and it has yet to disappoint. Each episode is amazing and I find myself wanting to watch a new one every night.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A42TV8FJP7MI3	Brian S.	"Certainly, this is not (as the spolight reviewer above contends) ""Soap Opera Galactica.""  The acting in Battlestar is certainly vastly superior to anything I've ever caught in daytime television.  The writing is compelling, as is the storyline.  The special effects are flawless, and the show handles cliff-hangers, dialogue, and character depth excellently.  Basically, the disagreement on whether this is a good show or not will probably (though not necessarily) come down to whether you like Sci-Fi or not.  If you don't like Sci-Fi, you probably won't like this.  And if you just like neat, clean, perfect-uniform Sci-Fi (like Star Trek) then you're less likely to like this gritty, dark, intense Sci-Fi (hi-tech gizmos get little time in this series).Lastly, though the first season stands on its own feet as a quality production, it's ridiculous to criticize things as poorly executed just because the show is witholding information for a later episode or season (if witholding information were so bad, LOST would be off the air by now).  Battlestar doesn't tell you everything you want to know in season one, or even in seasons one and two.  Big shocker - they want you to keep watching (and do a good job of encouraging you to).Basically, if you haven't caught this series yet, get a hold (rent, borrow from a friend) of the first one or two episodes of season one.  If you like those, you'll probably like the rest.  All in all, I think this series is the best written, most-consistent, most-realistic Sci-Fi series I've seen."	5.0	Perhaps the best-executed Space/Sci-Fi drama	2007-03-26	3	3	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1QJ4SLT5BPTGF	Brian Sloan	If you like Star Wars or Star Trek, you will like this show even though the directing/ editing is definitely not very accurate or detailed.Example: Season 1 Episode 1 begins with: &#34;Last time on Battlestar Galactica...&#34;  This is the first episode, how could there have been a last time?Spoiler examples: In episode 3, they release a full population of prisoners using minimal unarmed staff. They offer for the prisoners to perform hard labor in an extremely hazardous environment to earn &#34;extra privileges&#34; in their cells. They are somehow surprised when the prisoners take the ship over instead, holding the staff as hostages. In episode 5, Kara Thrace (Flight Trainer) crash landed on a random planet after a brief skirmish with the Cylon. Kara's ship is totaled, but a Cylon ship which was also shot down near her is somehow fully functional with the exception of a few holes. Kara simply holds her leg over the holes and is, #1 able to fly this alien spacecraft like a pro, & #2 is not sucked out of the holes into the super vacuum of space as she leaves the atmosphere... perhaps she has super powers we don't know about yet, or maybe... SHE IS A CYLON!!!  Have a few beers before you start each episode and you won't care or even notice those details.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A35R6YF02ZEDSH	Bruno Desjardins	"When I heard there would be a new Battlestar Galactica, I was not sure this would be a great idea.But Ron Moore was to be at the helm and that convinced me to give the series a chance. Who's Moore? He started out writing the best Star Trek ""The Next Generation"" episodes of the early years before getting on board the ""Deep Space Nine"" team. He left the Star Trek family during ""Voyager"" where he worked as a creative consultant getting frustrated by the direction Paramount adopted for that series. So I knew this series would be well written and intelligent... And it is.It's not the BG of your childhood. The new series' Adama is not the wise and charismatic patriarch Lorne Green was. Adama is now a troubled commanding officer, a true soldier that believes he must fight. His relationship with Lee Adama, his son (Codename ""Apollo"") is very strained. ""Starbuck"" and ""Boomer"" are both played by women in the new series. Colonel Tai, a forgettable character in the original series, is now more believeable as Adama's executive officer... He is not appreciated by junior officers and has a drinking problem... He is an angry man who can get the job done... The government, almost absent from the original series, is very much present in the new series and the President - an idealistic woman who did not choose this position - is at odds with Adama... Their conflicting views make good drama...I'm quite certain Moore wanted the characters to be complex. No character is more complex than Baltar... Ridiculous in the original series, Baltar has become a facinating character in the new series. Manipulated by a Cylon to whom he is sexually addicted, or maybe even in love with, the guy is not evil... No good guys and bad guys here... Shades of gray and nuances everywhere. Not your childhood's Battlestar Galactica... Life, sex, problems... Even sprituality - which was ever present in the original series that was piloted by Mormons...The music is interesting. Powerful and subdued at the same time...The SFX are excellent once you accept that the tactics they use are close to dogfighting in WW2! Then again, in BG technology is not trusted for obvious reasons... The military look and feel of the series is not that different from that of Space Above and Beyond, a sc-fi series of the early 90s created by people who would later join Chris Carter's X-Files...Again, this is not your childhood's BG: if the main story remains the same, in its execution, the new series is more compelling and intelligent. This is no longer a ""shoot'em up"" space opera series... This time, survival is important. Logistics are important. Morale is important... There is the fear of sabotage, fear of dying, fear of losing a loved one... Apparently it took robots to create characters that would really be Human...You missed it on TV? At this price, the 4 hour pilot and 13 episodes are a steal... And since the original series lasted only a year or so, there is a lot of room to create something entirely new in the coming seasons...

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AYNAH993VDECT	bsg2004	"There are already other detailed reviews, so I am going to keep it short:For fans of this show=====================This is the best value for money as it includes the mini-series (sells for $20+ as stand-alone DVD), as well as other extras and deleted scenes, some of which may be available at scifi.com, but having them at DVD-quality is a big plus.For SciFi fans==============This is at the same level as Babylon 5. It is a must see. This is ""realistic"" sci-fi but very creative, complex, thought provoking, at times dark, but also with the scifi special effects, spaceships and space battles.For non-Scifi fans==================This is a show about the human condition, especially when pushed to the edge. It is a drama set in space that touches upon a variety of issues, such as family dramas, politics, religion, military, survival, etc. There are no aliens with fancy outfits and gallons of makeup here: Just humans, cylons (robotic and humanoid) and the dark emptiness of space.DVD Package Description=======================* This DVD set contains five (5) DVD disks.* The box says ""Dual layer"" so I am guessing the DVDs are dual layer, but this is just my guess.* Each disk comes with its own slim case.* The back of each disk has brief descriptions of each episode included in the disk.* The front of each disk contains a welcome surprise to Battlestar Galactica fans. It has a full-page portrait of the main characters as follows:- Disc 1: Commander Adama (Olmos)- Disc 2: President Roslin- Disc 3: Apollo- Disc 4: Starbuck- Disc 5: Number Six and Gaius BaltarDVD contents============For each episode a one-paragraph synopsis is shown in the DVD menu for that episode.Disk 1------  Contains the Mini-series which is 3 hours long without commercials. The advertising materials erroneously reports it as a ""4 hour mini series"". It is 4-hours when shown on broadcast TV with about 15 minutes of commercials per hour. This disk also includes a director's audio track. NOTE: None of the Mini-series bonus materials are included here. Those are only available on the stand-alone mini-series DVD set which currently sells around $18 on AmazonDisk 2------ Contains the first four episodes along with audio commentary. At the beginning there are about 3 minutes of ads for DVD sets of other TV shows.Disk 3------ Contains episodes 5-8 with audio commentaryDisk 4------ Contains episodes 9-12 with audio commentaryDisk 5------ Contains episode 13, along with the following bonus materials:* Deleted Scenes: Available as one title. The deleted scenes of each episode comprise one chapter, so you can easily navigate them by chapter. The first chapter is the UK opening with the UK theme which will delight hardcore BSG fans :-) (The episodes on the disk have the USA opening theme - as it was broadcast on the SciFi channel)* Sketches and Art* Eight behind-the-scenes featurettes* The Series Lowdown - it was broadcast originally on the SciFi channel to promote Season 1 of BSG* Total run time for this disc is about 3 hours."	5.0	Brilliant work - a must not just for SciFi fans!	2005-07-26	30	25	5

This HD DVD release does have some flaws; disks can get small scratches due to the design of the case, but every disk played perfectly.  The video seems below that of what we might expect, but this show was intentionally shot grainy and that grain is more apparent in HD.  HOWEVER, after watching it in both SD and HD, I like the HD DVD set by far.  Look for jaggies...they are almost invisible in the HD DVD version, to the point that it's difficult to watch the same shows now in SD.  Another point to remember is that not only does this set include all of season one, it has the complete mini-series pilot as well.  This alone makes the HD set comparable in price to the SD DVD, with the special features of the HD extras coming as a fantastic bonus!  If you are a fan of BG, and would like to see Universal release the other seasons in HD, then by all means BUY THIS SET!

Given the recent exposure of government spying and computer system vulnerabilities, the series is probably more relevant today than when it first aired.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A5I88702K12HM	Carmilla	I came into this show thinking it was going to be extremely cheesy sci-fi schlop. Boy was i wrong...The 3 hour long mini series on disc 1 flew by with me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I was gripping the arm rest wondering what was laying ahead for the Galactica crew and human civilization as a whole.The acting was wonderful and there are a ton of likeable characters like the tremendous Commander Adama, the caring chief, the likeable/hatable Gauis, and the easy on the eyes Number 6. The reuniting scenes of many of the survivors had me smiling with emotion.And i was floored by the special effects. They are extremely good for a tv series and can hold its own to just about every full feature film made. I loved the muffled explosions and sound effects of the space battles.I guess im a late comer to this series and i have a lot of catching up to do with the entire series.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3UIMUKUZZZUTG	Carrie L. Alden	"If the ratings scale went lower than one, I'd give Battlestar Galactica lower than one! Though I haven't seen the original series, I'm sure that even with it's 70's quality writing, and effects it would be much better than this sorry excuse for a sci fi show. The stories are slow and towards the end of the season have a creepy religious undertone. The shaky camera work, which is supposedly ""edgy,"" instead tends to make watching it even more nauseating. While the effects are above par, effects, as so often is the case nowadays, do not make a show. If you ever get the desire to watch this show, I suggest first that you slam your head in a door, instead. It would be a far more rewarding experience."	1.0	A Excellent example of what's wrong with Television	2005-08-10	134	22	112

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A21VGNU5959O85	CaterpillarGirl	"Following the three hour miniseries Season One does not go downhill. In fact it just gets better and better, each episode grabbing you drawing you into its unexplainable addictiveness. You can't just watch one, you must watch another and another and pretty soon you have gone through 13 episodes as if they were sci-fi crack. I had watched a couple of episodes here and there on TV, and I couldn't follow what was going on, I was lost. Watching the entire season, in order, with no commercials is so worth the money, and things make so much more sense now! I love how the writers don't draw out plotlines till they are weak and thin and uninteresting. Most shows nowadays feel like they need to fixate on the banality of human nature, where Battlestar has oodles of human interest stories it doesn't make you want to scream ""enough already"" in regards to romance, action, and plot twists, character development and storylines. At times I would be watching one and be so engrossed and BAM the intro begins and I would say ""that was just the beginning?"" I had felt like I had watched almost 45 minutes already!  Not only is it the best show on television right now, it's the best looking. The saturation of colors for Caprica, and Galactica, outer space and otherwise is beautiful. The costumes, sets, and all around design of the show is outstanding and should be recognized. I watched the old movie and series and loved them, but this modern day version is a masterpiece.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2A3K6XHCCTJGH	C. Chan	I managed to get through the entire season 1 and the first disc of season 2 before completely giving up on this series. I seriously do not understand why so many people think this show is so great. The acting is really bad and the storylines are mostly silly. Additionally, every character is so flawed that there isn't a single one that you feel any sympathy for. So you end up either feeling hopeless because humanity doesn't deserve to survive in these peoples' hands, or worse you end up rooting for the Cylons.Don't believe the hype. And don't waste your time on a garbage show like this. There are a ton of other better shows out there on DVD that are worth your time. Just off the top of my head - Veronica Mars, Firefly, How I Met Your Mother, Robot Chicken, Lost, Heroes, 24 (barely). Heck, even the first two seasons of the O.C. was better. I'm giving up on Battlestar and moving on to the Wire season 1. Then after that I'm going to check out Jericho. I have also heard good things about House.	1.0	not a good show	2008-05-20	52	13	39
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AK5448HOQZAOE	C. Cobb	As the title suggests, this episode deals with the loss of a huge amount of water and one of the character's suspicion that she is a Cylon.  The actress did a good job conveying both of her roles, on the Galactica and on Caprica.  An explanation of how they fixed the 2 holes in the side of the ship would have been nice.  Much characterization for several of the main characters, such as the schizo doctor and the madame president.  All in all, a good second episode to a rather interesting series.	4.0	No water + Cylon Sleeper Agent = Good episode	2012-10-04	1	0	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3VP5SXUTKJFRW	"C. DeGhoul ""urieldewolf"""	"Being a fan of the original series, I must confess that when I heard the rumors of a new BG series I was skeptical. When I heard that Starbuck was going to be a WOMAN, I was appalled. Admittedly, my initial reaction was based on the fact that the original Starbuck was the character I loved most in the original BG -- and the fact that I had a teenage crush on Dirk Benedict. lol Starbuck is now a woman?! Sacrilege!! Cylons now look like humans?! Where's the fun in that?! How DARE they tamper with my beloved original! But I decided, what the heck, let's see how bad it really is and THEN I can be fair in my dislike.So, I watched the mini-series that was to launch the rest of it. Hmmm... I'm a fan of E.J. Olmos and Mary McDonnell. Maybe it won't be as bad as I think it is... What's with the camera style? Ooh! Little hints and nods to the original series. What? Apollo doesn't worship the ground his father walks on?? And he isn't very likable. Starbuck... A little too in-your-face but interesting... What's with all the sex and/or implied sex? Sure, it's realistic but it's so... mature. Everything is much darker, far more grim, than the original, but it feels right for the world we live in today.I finished with the feeling of being pleasantly surprised but still a little uncertain, a little ambivalent. I watched it again. Liked it better. Left it for a month or so. Watched it once more. Hey, this is actually pretty good. Watched it a fourth time, this time with the commentary, which helped explain the intent behind the unusual camera style. I was liking it even more and was actually eager to see how they went beyond the mini-series.Well, I'm in the middle of season one and I just can't hold back any longer. I'm addicted to this new show, even if it's so very unlike my beloved original. The characters and situations are more complex than the original. Yes, sex overtly exists in this new BG and, yes, everything is darker, grimmer, and sometimes arguably out-right depressing, but it resonates in the still-wounded post-9/11 soul. There's a truth to it, a gritty reality that the original version did not have. It's not light-hearted escapism though it definitely has its humor. And the acting? I was/am simply pleasantly amazed. Most shows take time for the actors to get a feel for their characters. The new BG shoots from the launch-tube without the usual new-series ungainly legginess. It's feels as if the actors have all been living in the skins of their characters for some time. Eddie and Mary are, as always, superb but the rookies are also surprisingly good. Better than good, actually. All the actors play their roles with conviction and heart. And another thing that surprised the heck out of me is the fact that the mini-series laid the foundation for the situation, the characters, the relationships between the characters, and even the backstory, with incredible thoroughness. When you get to the series-proper, you already know who these people are, how they feel, how they relate with each other, the ghosts of their past, etc. They end up feeling 'familiar' right at the onset of the actual series, like people you've known for a long time.To sum up my new BG experience so far, I liken it to (a woman) having sex for the very first time. (A not-altogether inappropriate metaphor, in this case.) At first, it's awkward and even a bit painful but then you realize afterwards that it wasn't really all THAT bad. In fact, maybe it's worth a second chance. The ""second chance"" goes much better so maybe then... Well, I'll stop the sex analogy there because if I continued it, I'd have to classify myself as a new-found nymphomaniac because I've gone from scornful skeptic to an admiring fan who is craving to see the next episode (on DVD. I gave up on watching television a long time ago.)If you're the type of die-hard fan of the original who is so closed-minded that there's no room in your heart and mind for two vastly different BGs to peacefully co-exist, then don't watch the new version. If you watched it once and felt, like I did, a little ambivalent about it, watch it a second time. A third time even. It is NOT and obviously was never intended to be a copy or even a continuation of the original and for me, a fan of the beloved original, I've finally come to see that as a good thing. They are so very different and both are great -- but for very different reasons. If you don't give it a fair chance, you'll never know what a splendid sci-fi show you're missing."	5.0	Unexpectedly... great!	2006-04-21	3	0	3

I have been a fan of the original when they were still showing it since I was a little girl. I love the music that the original have. Now I am in my early thirties and a mother of two. I fell in love with the new mini series starring Edward James Olmos as Commander Adama.  I think they pick the best man to play the role.  He is such a good actor. His performance is exceptional along with the whole entire cast.  The drama is much more real. No disrespect to the original series intended when I say this.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AIP23YVXTS8EH	Chris B	I never really watched Battlestar Galactica when it was on TV. I watched the first part of the Miniseries, but that was it. I didn't think I'd like a gritty adaptation of the original Battlestar Galactica. Then, as I saw the finale was coming up, I found that despite myself I had a desire to watch the series that was so acclaimed.So I did. And it truly is great. It is highly addictive; the characters and the plot are excellent. This may be the best series I've seen since Firefly or The X-Files.I can't really say much about the plot or the characters without spoiling, but try out this set; if you like it, you will want to buy the others. However, please note, the Miniseries *is* included in this set. Don't buy it separately! I did, then later found out it was on the collection. Thankfully, Amazon was amazing and allowed me to return the purchase.If you have any interest in the sci-fi genre or dramatic television shows, buy this season, and I'm sure you'll be back for more.	5.0	Truly the best TV show of the last 5 years	2009-04-14	1	0	1

The set will also includes some exclusive extras that are only available on HD-DVD plus all of the original extras from the previous DVD release. From what I've heard, BSG (plus Heroes) won't be released on Blu-ray disc because they are owned by Universal and they have a contract with HD-DVD.I started watching the show via DVD and just got hooked straight away. I was engaged by every episode and just couldn't wait to click on to the next one. I really love the style of the show and the direction it has taken. I recommend it too anyone who loves sci-fi and would say it's second to none. Although Firefly and Farscape are also brilliant.If you don't have a HD-DVD player but have an XBox 360 then I suggest getting the add-on. You can get one of eBay pretty cheap. I bought mine for around 75 pounds. So it's quite a lot cheaper than a blu-ray disc player.	5.0	Fracking best show!	2007-08-30	19	11	8

It has- great acting- very intelligent writing- complex, well-developed characters- lots of suspense- very interesting man vs. machine conflict- strong continuityDon't take my word for it. The Christian Science Monitor recently named Battlestar Galactica ""The best show on TV"" and wrote: ""The 1970s series Battlestar Galactica was so dinky that it played like ""Bonanza"" in space. The Sci-Fi Channel's radically reinvented version shares the same premise: A fleet of refugees traverses the galaxy in search of a far-off promised land, Earth. This time, though, it uses the story line as an allegory for the post-9/11 zeitgeist. The characters and plotting are so complex that you'll find other shows like ""Lost"" comparatively dull."""	5.0	The best show on TV	2005-09-07	35	30	5

LOL!It's all far more bleak and serious than the original, but that doesn't make it profound. Some kind of fun remake on the old show might have been entertaining.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AL2NGP98SD74S	Chris	I have to say i love this. In the real world where spending quality time with your father is difficult this is amazing. I watched this with both my father and brother and dear goodness it was great. I've become a battlestar junky, when the first season ended there were withdrawl symptoms for crying out loud. It lives up to the hype, is gritty, complex, entralling, funny, realistic and truly one of the greatest series, scifi or otherwise, ever made.Plus - having watched the original, the cyclons are brilliant - they're this force of ominus unknown horror and you can never really tell what they're planning. In the original they're just after you and chronically stupid.You literally feel like they're after you and its shot in such a way as to drag you in and make you feel like you're actually there.The BEST THING must be its unpredictability - things can shift at any moment and take a turn for the horrific. The viewer is also privy to particular things that the characters don't always see or notice, which can leave you quite simply: yelling at the tv to try to get the characters attention.As the story continues you feel like you're getting another piece of the puzzle as to what the Cyclons are planning. And at every step there's a new shock.The characters are so realistic too; living life as best they can, trying to find a way to a new home.It can be really funny at times and sometimes you'll wish the events you're seeing are a joke.My father - a chronic watcher of the original has given up the original series all together.The CGI is perfect, the acting is intense, the storylines are original and heart-stopping. This is quite possibly the most exciting thing your likely to see this side of the apocalypse.With a climactic end to this first season that had my brother, my father and me yelling to high heavens at the screen, and looking at each other not knowing what to do.See this. Believe me, you'll be amazed.	5.0	Climactic, Cataclysmic, Crazy, Critical...oh dear goodness just get this no matter what you do this millenium!!	2006-01-19	6	6	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	Many have said it, and I'll say it again... This is the best show on Television, of any genre. Hands down.The opening scene where the human delegate shows up at the agreed upon meeting place, knowing that it has been 40 years since the end of the Cylon war and the Cylon's have never shown up, and when the door opens and the Cylon lumbers around the corner, the human's face drawn with shock... I knew, that this show was back and it was cool.What makes Battlestar Gallactica a cut above the rest, is the upgraded Cylons, the dynamite weightlessness feel the soundtrack gives you when the fighter pilots fire their canons into deep space and the drum beats that accompany them, the incredible storylines that accompany a desperate and depleated human race as they scramble for hiding places from the newly refreshed and technically superior Cylon army... but more than anything... it's the human dramas that put this show over the top.Ultimately, that is what Battlestar Gallactica is about. It's about the human issues, romance, power struggles, friendship, bravery, having a cigar, alcoholism, trusting each other, rebuilding a society and making decisions that keep you alive.That is what makes Battlstar Gallactica the homerun show that it is. It's reliance on human issues is the heart and soul of the show. What makes us better than a race of robots? Emotions. Personalities. Love. Our nature to cherish life.BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA is a smash. Edward James Olmos plays Cmdr. Adama who struggles between his human emotions and his military emotions. Mary McDonnell plays Laura Rosin, who is the next in line surviving politician and default President. Jamie Barber plays Cmdr. Adamas son Lee and top fighter pilot. The beautiful Katee Sackhoff plays the tomboy, tough as nails Lt. Kara Starbuck who puts herself out there, time after time, in order to prove herself.The show is rich from all angles and the best on T.V. in a time when many currently running shows can wrongfully say the same thing.	5.0	EMOTIONALLY CHARGED SCI-FI	2006-09-11	8	7	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2UKA4L4SC9N0H	Christopher Bosken	First, the first season of Battlestar Galactica lived up to our expectations.  'BG' is a pretty entertaining sci-fi show, and we watched the first season over the course of a few days.That being said, the second-market HD-DVD discs are a great value.  The Blu-Ray discs have been slow to come out (other than an expensive series set), so our options at the time were regular dvds or the HD-DVDs.  True, HD-DVD is a dead format, but if you still have a player, picking up a few cheap discs might be worth it.  For us, it certainly was- the high-def HD-DVDs were cheaper than the DVD set!  Of course we also enjoyed the higher resolution.Thoroughly happy with our purchase.	5.0	Great series, HD-DVD is a great value	2010-01-23	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A385D433KD42PT	Christopher C. Smith	"I recently watched Season 1 on DVD in a week's time.  This show is astonishingly well-written and well-acted.  Katee Sackhoff (""Starbuck"") can cry on command; Grace Park (""Boomer"") plays multiple characters, each with their own nuances; Mary McDonnell (""Laura Roslin"") is a wonderful, strong female character of the sort that unfortunately shows up all too rarely in American cinema.  One of the show's selling points, in my opinion, is that it takes itself seriously, and manages to do so gracefully.  This is a rare feat in a science fiction flick; most of us take even Star Trek and Star Wars with a grain of salt (not to mention Stargate or Andromeda), but somehow Battlestar comes across as maintaining a healthy realism without being overbearing.  What's more, the dialogue is excellent and artfully delivered.Having said all that, I do have some reservations.  I frankly find Dr. Baltar's sexual charades with his imaginary friend ""Number Six"" (a cylon temptress who fancies herself some sort of religious sage) extremely tedious.  When Starbuck walked in on him while he was screwing her in his lab, I couldn't help but shake my head at how juvenile it was.  This is the classic pitfall of good science fiction: catering to nerds who spend all day looking at porn on the internet, and thereby destroying its credibility as a weighty, even philosopohical drama.All in all, this is one of the best shows I've ever been addicted to.  I recently ordered Season 2.0 and 2.5 on DVD, and I eagerly await their arrival.  Highly recommended!"	5.0	An Excellent Show, with Minor Flaws	2007-03-23	11	7	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1GW7V6S6XSXX3	Christopher Mayo	"I bought all of the seasons separately as they first came out, and I highly recommend watching the entire television series through to the end. While looking for the last piece of the series (see the end of the review), I came across some great deals (in terms of price), but was dismayed to see just how confusing things have become on Amazon. This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.DVD CONFUSION-------------------------------------------------------The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.========================================-Season One was released as (Battlestar Galactica  - Season One) altogether with the pilot in one box.-Season Two was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)andBattlestar Galactica: Season 2.5 (Episodes 11-20)in two boxes. You can now purchase them together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Seasons 2.0 & 2.5-Season Three was released together in one box asBattlestar Galactica - Season Three.-Season Four was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 4.0andBattlestar Galactica: Season 4.5with the Razor episode. Those are now available together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Season 4.0 & 4.5. Occasionally I come across things like ""Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009)."" It seems like a lot of money for one part of the full season, but you get some dog tags with it, so if you are into collecting memorabilia, you might want to consider it.-The Plan was released on its own asBattlestar Galactica: The Plan========================================OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD--------------------------------------------------------Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.BOTTOM LINE:-------------------------------------------------------As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:(1) Buy either Blu-Ray set or the Gray DVD set.(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).NOTE:--------------------------------------------------------The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!-Also, if anyone sees any mistakes in this review, please tell me and I will edit it. Frustratingly, the manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some sets, so it is possible that my information has become outdated."	5.0	Confused about What to Buy?

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2192NU7GQVUV2	Citizen Arcane	I ordered the first season of BSG only after it went on sale for 17.99 a few months ago.  I had never watched the show, but had read many reviews and thought that, for the price, the first season was worth checking out.  I was not disappointed, especially considering that the mini-series that aired before season one is included in the season one box set.  However, the acting isn't that great, though the stories make up for the lack of frakin' talent, and almost every episode was not what I expected from a supposedly sci-fi program.  I was pleased with the dramatic elements enough to where I will be on the look out for a cheap price on season 2 and 2.5.  Yet when I see that the price for season one is nearly forty dollars, if not more, I don't think it is worth the price considering the time that has passed since it was initially offered on DVD.  If you can find it for a reasonable price then I would recommend it, otherwise NetFlix that frakin' stuff.	4.0	when the price is right then the show is good	2010-04-22	2	1	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A13SOXNMWXQVNU	ClickmeClickme	"WOW!This is not a review about all the technical details and who does what in the show. This is a simple testimonial from my wife and I:We have lost a lot of night's sleep because we couldn't turn it off! It is like an ongoing epic movie, a masterpiece. Every episode has had revelations and the story never stalls. This is absolutely one of the top shows of all time. No it's not perfect but it is well written and it's easy to look over any minor problems because it's just so much FUN.We have yelled ""OH YEAH!"" at the TV screen sometimes. The writing and the story and the characters are all top notch. EVERY episode has been brilliant.Almost every review has been 5 stars but I noticed one guy gave it 1 star and he said a bunch of flowery words and dismissed it as a space opera. What an Idiot! I just want to shake him!OK one technical detail that I hope to clear up for some people because I was confused at first:Season 1 comes in one package.Season 2 comes in TWO packages called 2.0 and 2.5. You need BOTH to have the complete season 2 (I originally bought season 2.5 thinking it was all of season 2 with some extras - I was wrong).I am willing to say that this show might not be for everybody. It might not be appropriate for younger viewers and it might not be suitable for....I don't know, people who don't like a good series? Of course there are some Science Fiction haters who like to try and ruin it for others - Haters! But it is well-done, well-written, FUN science fiction that we love!Final thought: Buy all the seasons on DVD with no commercials and better picture quality. Put the kids down and/or block out some time, make something tasty like nachos (loaded with colby-jack cheese, jalape&ntilde;os, beans, tomatoes, black olives, lettuce, avocado, sour cream, salsa), sit down with someone you love, and enjoy it for the great TV show that it is!"	5.0	Battlestar and Nachos!

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Battlestar Galactica was always one of those shows that it's not that I never got into it, I just never got around to it. Certain shows I don't have an interest of getting into while other ones end just while interest is building. So it was with a worry and anticipation that I decided to watch the show. As I kept watching, I wondered something: am I still watching because I'm addicted or because I can't stand having shows unfinished. Well it has to be the latter cause I'm dipping into season 2 now so it's obviously a really great show.Things start off in the 3 hour miniseries premiere. In the future, humans created AI being named Cylons to help themselves out. In a Terminator/Matrix move, they become self-aware and a war brews. A space station is developed for negotiations and the Cylons never sent anyone for 40 years. Until one day, nuclear weapons go off in various worlds, killing many. Meanwhile, the ship Galactica is going to be turned into a museum until it becomes the primary force for combating the Cylons there's only one problem: they now have the capability to mimic human form making them impossible to detect. And so the war starts.In a weird way one of the disadvantages of shows like Alias or Lost is that it's hard to just randomly watch an episode. Unlike let's say something like the Simpsons or even the X-Files where you jump in any season in any episode order, it helps if you watch Lost or Alias right from the beginning. Battlestar Galactica in a way isn't as bad where you can watch certain episodes out of sequence but certain plot elements might confuse. Initial first viewings will hook you in but I don't know how much repeat viewings you can get out of it.One of the great things about the show is just how much character development there is. Nobody seems outright evil and characters can be sympathetic and emotional than all of a sudden turn despicable or turn into a little *****. And unlike some of those ""real but not"" characters from other sci-fi shows, the ones that aren't human actually go through moments where they question why they are what they are or why they can do to be more human. You'll certainly find many favorites on the show and ones you just love to hate. The fact that there's practically no throw-aways speaks to the quality of the writing.Does the big bad show of problems? Well a couple I suppose. One, the ""are they a Cylon or not"" elements seem slightly repetitive and one of the characters has him seeing a Cylon that only he could see. While it does make him a more tragic/scheming character, she appears so often it's like ""ugh her again?"". And while technically impressive, in order to achieve a more better quality in outer space shots, the constant zooming or panning seems kind of excessive, especially if it's just a non-combat idea.Is it a series worth getting into? Definately. Well-written, exciting and even surprising at times, it's quite a feat to take what was largely a more comical sci-fi series into some compelling drama."	5.0	Caught me completely by surprise	2006-10-14	6	3	3

Then it's like &#34; well, okay this isn't as good as it used to be but I'll ride it out so I know what happens&#34;. Then you hit the last episode and you realize you just wasted eighty hours of your life on one of the worst endings to a show you've ever seen or could even imagine and you wish you had never seen the show in the first place.It makes me sad to even think I spent this much time on a show that could have been great. You know how breaking bad could have totally ended at the end of the forth season because it was just such a fulfilling last episode to the season? Well this was the polar opposite to that, it's like the writers had the knife in your stomach already and you hoped they'd just pull it out and make it better, but then they just twisted it.	1.0	Stay away from this show.	2014-02-08	5	1	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A7L37OGM961F6	Cotton	"This series is completely different than the campy TV series with Lorne Green at the helm.  Thank goodness... it is far superior.  I think for several decades now, many of us Sci-Fi junkies like the genre because it allows us to see ourselves through different prisms, different perceptual lenses.  Perhaps through it all there is a hope for something better than we currently are as individuals, as a society, and as a world.Yet, we are who are are, warts and all.  And ignoring our imperfections will not help us become better.  Gandhi once said ""Be the change that you want to see in the world,"" and while I very much agree to this mantra it helps to know WHAT needs to be changed first.Battlestar Galactica offers just such a prism... and what a rich and large prism it is!  True, I enjoy the battle and action scenes as much as anyone, but the gritty one-on-one dialogs are even more telling.  It proves that courageous people can do magnificent and heroic deeds, yet still fall prey to wrong behavior and assumptions from time to time.  None of us are perfect, but we need to keep forging ahead to a better existence... in ourselves and our world.  We cannot stop that journey, no matter the obstacles and distractions and surprises that may come along the way.  After watching each Battlestar Galactica episode, I find my thoughts connecting plot twists with real life stuff... my obstacles, my battles, my surprises.I highly recommend this DVD series."	5.0	Battlestar Galactica - A Prism Into Ourselves	2006-02-24	3	3	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1QTL5BXBO8H8Q	Craig Correa	"This show has me hooked - I can't wait for the rest of Season 2 to be released!!It wasn't originally high on my list, just one of those shows I was going to get around to watching at some point. I loved the original as a kid, and wasn't too keen on the idea of a re-make. A friend of mine recently told me it was great, so I decided to check it out. Glad I did.It starts out well enough. The mini series portion of Season 1 (the first disc) is basically a military space drama. There's the ship and its crew, then the attack, the aftermath and the flight from the Cylons. Then they start folding in other elements of the story; social commentary, political tensions, then religion, mythology and finally prophecy. Everything keeps building the up the pace. By the last five episodes of season 1 the show is rocking!The decision to have the Cylons manipulate human genetic material for their own purposes is the best change from the original. It opens up a vast landscape of ethical and I'd say even spiritual considerations. Most of the people understandably view the cloned Cylons as ""toasters,"" things, still machines. For me the questions it raises have to do with what attributes are inherent in a biological entity, irregardless of how it came to be. Does a living, breathing humanoid form possess a soul? Does a vehicle of that nature naturally invite one in? Is consciousness they key? And if so, to what extent can external programming over-ride the impulses of a being with a soul? Great philosophical considerations if you're interested in those kinds of things.The one thing that I found distracting at first was the decision to make a lot the sets contemporary American. Architecture I can understand and I think it works well enough for the show. But the furniture and the cloths are just too here and now. People with modern day suits and ties... and glasses. Even some of the land vehicles and personal electronics are just too USA. Hummers with license plates, electric lamps plugged into US power outlets, that kind of thing. These are pretty minor though in comparison to the great writing and acting. It's less of a distraction now than it was at first.There seems to be an underlying ulterior motive to some (not all) of the negative ratings here, which is too bad. Over the last 4/5 years of wading through political blogs I've learned to pick up on the subtle indications of ""agenda"" disguised as legitimate critique, and I'm picking them up here. The show is very intelligent, not obvious in all of its plot lines, and allows the viewer to speculate about what is really going on. People who claim the characters are flat or stereotyped probably haven't watched it all the way through - they're not. Either that or they might have, um, what's the word I'm looking for... oh yeah! An ""agenda"".Anyways, this show is a finely crafted drama, extremely complex and has proven to be a fertile ground for exploring numerous broad and wide-ranging issues that affect humanity today. I invite you to explore this richly imagined world with an open mind and see what it has to present to you. Shows like this don't come along that often, and I hope this one has a long compelling run."	5.0	A Completely Engaging Series!!	2006-02-14	17	15	2

I think this is what really sets Battlestar Galactica apart from the rest of those other space ""shoot em up"" type of shows...but dont get me wrong, this show has it's fair share of dazzeling special effects with tons of action as well.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3MYELGY9U5Q7Q	"Curtis Chambers ""Curtis Chambers"""	"In difficult times, movies (and television shows) have often provided us with a helpful uplift. What's more, I think it is fair to say Hollywood makes movies and television better than anyone else, and in fact, movies are one of America's most successful exports. Hollywood has a huge share of the world's entertainment market, with over half of the audiences for Hollywood's movies coming from outside the USA.And so it is always a delight to discover a really good movie or TV show, not just because the show is enjoyable, but because it is nice to see what America can produce. I think Hollywood succeeds so well because making good movies requires a mixture of good business sense, imagination, technical skill, and audacity - typically American virtues.These elements certainly come together in the SciFi Channel's ""Battlestar Galatica."" This series, which ran four years and won both Emmy and Peabody Awards, features great writing, acting, and superior special effects (the special effects are better than that of most big budget Science Fiction movies).The plot is a science fiction standard, and yet it is complex and multi-hued. Mankind created a race of increasingly sophisticated machines, which of course have become superior to their creator and rebelled. Now the two are at war. The story arc has a bit of a dark edge. Humanity is struggling for survival, and at times the machines can almost seem like the good guys, as they take on increasingly human qualities, while the real humans can at times behave quite cruelly. What is left of mankind is only about 50,000 people who are on the run, traveling through space in a sort of wagon train to the stars.I tend to avoid the SciFi Channel, but after reading the critical acclaim the show has received, I am glad I made an exception. I am just finishing Season 1, and I am looking forward to watching the next three seasons on DVD."	5.0	When the going gets tough, the tough watch a good TV series...	2009-05-11	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3EWHWKF78PKYZ	Curt Loveall	"This is for anyone thinking about starting Battlestar Galactica, particularly those who have never seen any of it.Tastes are such a personal thing.  Having grown up with Star Trek TOS, Lost in Space, and then Star Trek NG, Stargate SG1 and a host of other series and movies, and being a huge fan of Science Fiction and the possibilities it opens both in the realm of science and the human condition, I have developed an eye to recognize and appreciate fantasy as well. Star Trek, Star Wars, SG1, Lost in Space and even Battlestar Galactica are all fantasy.  The ""science"" is, for the most part, while true to their respective universes, pure gibberish.Setting that though aside, having just completed the entire series (the last season 4.5 I watched in its entirety), let me also say that the reimagined Battlestar has to be my favorite adventure stories of them all.  Stood next to the ""Barbie Doll"" sterility of the Star Trek milieu, BG is a grittily realistic space-bound aircraft carrier: no transporters, no Asgard beam technology, no photon torpedoes, phasers or communicators, no view screens.  The ""big guns"" are conventional nukes. The ship and the Vipers/Rapters launch missiles and blast away with bullets, the pilots and marines armed with semi-automatic pistols and machine guns.  Communications are accomplished by really old-looking, clunky phones or wireless radios.  Want to see what's outside?  Have a peek at the DRADIS ""Direction, RAnge, and DIStance"" radar.  The Galactica itself, about to be decommissioned as a museum, shutters and creaks, is a dark, grimy, cavernous hulk (concessions must be made to accommodate cameras, sound and lighting), with a worn, lived in look and feel that ages, not too gracefully, as the series progresses.  You can almost smell the fuel, grease and sweat.  It is populated with characters you come to love or hate, some you'll hate to see depart, as they do on a seemingly regular basis, some you'll wish every episode to get their comeuppance and some you'll grieve to see going down the wrong path, and even a few that just make you say ""Huh?""  You are regularly shifted between the conflict with the Cylons, the interpersonal dynamics of some 49 thousand survivors living in close proximity and the various regular characters as they struggle with their inner demons and identities in the new world order.This isn't a show for young children.  The effects are stunning,  the space battles operatic.  The violence is at times shocking and graphic, but never, I thought, gratuitive, with one possible exception.  Sex is likewise in the open, though used to advance the story arcs of individual characters.The series was fairly short-lived, as series go, just 6 seasons (if you count 2.5 and 4.5 as separate seasons.  I never saw it when it was on, and I don't get the whole "".5"" season concept except as a ploy to get you to buy more CD sets), plus a couple ""movies"" that fill in some gaps in the narrative line.  The Series is well acted, well produced and well thought out, with all the action moving inexorably toward the conclusion which I found satisfying, poignant, sad  and at times hokey.  Part of me just didn't want the adventure to end.A final word: check the episode list before you start to watch.  Some of the disks have duplicate extended episodes that never aired on TV."	5.0	Batllestar Galactica Well Worth It	2010-07-30	2	2	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2ZI9PN9Q3SFW8	"dallas ""whovian2222"""	"918 of 986 people found the following review helpful:Soap Opera Galactica, December 26, 2005This plays like a cross between Melrose Place and the original Galactica. The supposed military aboard the ship spend most of their time being insubordinate, whining tediously about their problems, and basically carrying on like actors having an endless series of hissy fits. Most of the characters are absurd as written and acted. The big series innovation, Cylons in human form, is just as stupid as it sounds, and is made worse by the attempt to parallel them with religious extremists--a poor idea executed badly. In fact the motivation of the Cylons--who had withdrawn from human contact for 40 years--is left a total mystery, which directly undermines the drama as it empties the conflicts of any meaning.In a desperate (and successful) bid for the short attention spans of geek fans, sexual themes are kept front and center which is what lends an awful soap opera quality to most episodes. Number six, a vamping Cylon sexpot, is particularly out of place in this or any other version of Galactica, although most of the time she is relegated to being a brain chip-produced hallucination in Baltar's head. (Why, when the Cylons are already infiltrated aboard the Galactica, is this ridiculous plot device even necessary?)The worst flaw is the self-seriousness of the series as a whole. Obnoxious moral grandstanding and adolescent bickering take up most of the stories, and stupefyingly telegraphed plot twists make watching them a long wait to get absolutely nowhere. Presumably this was done to stretch out the budget dollar, as constant talking and bickering is cheaper to film than a faster-moving and more eventful plot series arc would be.In the original series space combat engagements were reused over and over to save money. This time around the CGI provides a little less need to rely on canned battle footage, however cost-cutting is evident elsewhere in the overall look of the sets and costuming (disconcertingly, this advanced society seems to shop for most of its civilian clothing at JCPenney).""Show don't tell"" is not a concept familiar to the writing team. The miniseries itself is stuffed with long (and boring) character exposition where, instead of showing character through action, the actors just read their backstories to each other. Strangely, although the miniseries is much longer than the original pilot and although it talks and talks and talks about the characters, by the end the viewer still has no conception of them except as walking, talking story devices. You can almost see future episode plots and subplots flash on the screen as details are related that have no bearing on the current story but are certain to come up in ""a very special episode"" later.In the end, Battlestar Galactica settles for being a humorless, derivative, and mind numbingly earnest imitation of every other sci-fi TV show out there in the past few years. One ends up rooting vigorously for the Cylons.-----------------------------------------------------------------918? You must have persuaded everybody at colonial fleets to come and vote on this! I can't imagine that many people ordinary people caring, but the galactica einsatzgruppen at the various ""fan"" sites seem to be obessed with expressing their immature disgust at every turn. I have to admit that many of the fans of the original show are some of the worst examples of gross immaturity I've ever seen. Sorry, Starbuck is a chick now!

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1X7P7KL59EH4A	Dan Brown	Initially I was hesitant to watch Battlestar Galactica because of the heavy science fiction setting that seemed to make up a good part of the show. I was sort of expecting something along the lines of a cheesy syfy original. I finally decided, at the ugrging of many friends, to give it a shot. Boy, am I glad I did. Imagine my surprise when, despite being pretty sure I was watching a scifi epic, it turned out that I was watching a very emotionally tense character driven drama that just happened to take place in space. I found myself caring about the characters and compelled by their (many) struggles. They have strengths, flaws, ups and downs, even the Cylons (the robotic race, don't worry, not a spoiler, it's literally one of the first things they tell you in the show) are complex and well developed characters. Now I can't say for sure whether or not BSG will be up your alley, but I can say that you should watch the first couple of episodes and give it a chance because it definitely didn't fit my expectations in a very good way.	5.0	Character Drama... in Space!	2013-04-11	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A14FSB9QNWMKP1	"Daniel Fazekas ""fds"""	Ever since I discovered what an addictive and fun time-waster they could be, I'm always on the lookout for great TV series to buy on DVD. Battlestar Galactica was getting a lot of buzz from all the right people, so I was eager to sample the current season once it was back on TV. And, for once, I wasn't sold -- I just didn't get what all the excitement was about. Granted, it's not the best idea to check out an unknown show mid-season, although that same routine has managed to get me hooked on some other series. Yet here I am writing this review, as I did end up buying this DVD set anyway when one day it showed up in my Gold Box and I just couldn't resist.Battlestar Galactica is classic sci-fi. Spaceships, enormous capital ships and agile fighter ships, organic alien ships, space battles, hyper-space jumps (now called Faster-Than-Light jumps), robots, man-created artificial intelligence which turns against its masters. All the things fans of the genre are extremely familiar with. And, surprisingly, it delivers. Battlestar Galactica is about as entertaining as the best of mainstream sci-fi can get.I did have problems with a couple of things at first. Battlestar Galactica plays it all too straight. People are constantly sad and depressed, and the somber mood rarely lets up. By all means, they are rightly miserable: humanity is on the brink of extinction, the odds heavily in favor of the enemy, with no allies left, no safe haven to go to, and no solution in sight. I still like my dramas with a generous helping of humor, so I was delighted to see that there are some laugh-out-loud moments in later episodes, even if rare. Just don't expect people cracking jokes and their dialog being eminently quotable. I also had a hard time for a good while in finding a character I could really root for and sympathize with, which is a bit unexpected, as this is one of those shows with an ensemble cast with plenty of regulars to choose from. The deadpan atmosphere is probably the one to blame for that too.Let's see what you're getting in this DVD set. First up is the miniseries. As it is presented on DVD as one continuous 3-hour long movie, you might as well simply call it the Pilot episode, a pretty long one at that. Then there are 13 regular forty-minute episodes, all in all over 12 hours of film. That amount is fine by me, what is a bit aggravating though is that there isn't really an ending. Instead of giving some kind of closure, the final episode only serves up brutal cliffhangers.The bonuses are about all right. What is noteworthy about them is that most of the extras are not exclusive to the DVD and are freely downloadable from the Sci Fi channel's website. That even includes series producer Ron Moore's commentary tracks, which are available as a Podcast the day a new episode airs. I don't mind the non-exclusivity, on the contrary, this type of caring for the fans should be applauded. The DVD does buy you convenience.Influencing my decision to purchase this was a little coupon in the Serenity DVD suggesting I also buy Battlestar Galactica, giving me hope there would be something in common between the two. Well, there really isn't. They're both sci-fi from Universal Studios and that's it. This show is more like Star Trek than it is like Firefly, however, don't let that make you think I'm having buyer remorse after all. I'll be ordering Season 2 the moment it's released in its entirety.	4.0	Classic sci-fi	2006-02-04	13	13	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1C1BIHWEKFUHU	Daniel Greenman	I resisted watching BSG at first.  I am a big Sci-fi fan but didn't think this would be very good. I was wrong.It has the elements of a great Sci-fi program in the tradition of Star Trek, Outer limits, and the Twilight Zone.The show has real characters and problems for people to face. The most important part of the show is that I care about some of the people.I think the best part of the program is that it is a big (what if) as in, what if the humans were being hunted to extinction. What if we had to balance survival and freedom? In BSG the enemy can look like us, (well a beautiful version of us). So there are no bumps on actors' foreheads or antennae glued to them.In the end all I can say is that every show is fast paced and an emotional trill ride.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?We don't get a fix on that in this first season of Michael Rymer's staggering new ""Battlestar Galactica"", but we do learn one thing for sure: the Cylons definitely believe in God.You already know the whole ""BSG"" drill: all the robotic Cylons want to do is just be friends with the shattered remnants of Human civilization.Only by ""Be Friends"", of course, the Cylons mean lobbing nukes helter-skelter at the Human Colonies, incinerating entire homeworlds, swooping down with their big shiny howling fighter ships on the screaming refugees, for a jolly little game of ""Strafe-the-Carbon-Based-Lifeform"", and rewarding the few surviving human females with a close encounter of the worst kind: strapped up as a brood-mare to a Cylon birthing vat. Call it a Blind Date, Cylon style.Those naughty Cylons, they never play nice. Is it any wonder the Humans run away?Anyway, Series 1 picks up right where the pilot left off: the Humans flee screaming from the Colonial Cluster, now either radioactive or Cylon occupied, packing themselves onto starships and forging a fleet around the Battlestar Galactica, all of them in search of a mystical paradisiacal planet called ""Earth"". Apparently nobody got Al Gore's memo that Earthlings had already reduced that planet to one vast oozing pustule of magma, a slagpit incapable of supporting a fruitbat flea.But what they don't know won't hurt them!Point is, the Cylons have adapted. They boast 12 Cylon models that look just like Me and You (well not you, but Me, anyway): the best of the bunch is the sultry Number 6 (the unspeakably, cravenly hot Tricia Helfer), who brings a new meaning to ""Love Devastation! Suicide Blonde!"". Or, for that matter, the old phrase ""getting inside your head"". Women. Anyway, Helfer does her little thang with the disintegrating Gaius Baltar (the delightful James Callis). Helfer---er, Number 6---can sing my Body Electric any day of the week.Two things are clear with Episode 1: 1) Director Michael Rymer has imbued this little jaunt into the techno-apocalypse with an insane level of conviction. ""BSG"" is hatefully consumptive TV-watching: I greedily gulped down each of these little nuggests of fear & loathing & bright pointy things, gulped them down like they were caviar skittles---and was left hungry for more!2) My God the ensemble acting works well! Even better than the meticulous set design and special effects---on that, there's really nothing more to say than the FX are grand, everything contributes to this low, mounting, menacing, ominous hum---is the acting.There are no walk-ons here, & everyone is playing off each other and working it to the hilt: whether it's the purring, grinning, terrified Baltar, the stoic but unstable Chief Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), the crusty Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan, who is going to lend me his boot whiskey-flask), the plucky Starbuck (honorably acquitted by the unfortunately named Katee Sackhoff)---all of them are champs.But it's in Episode 1 that Edward James Olmos nails it with his Commander Adama in a way Lorne Greene never did. Greene never had the darkness or the acting chops: Olmos does, and can brood and glower with the best of them. He's great. He owns every scene he's in. He provide this fierce, ferocious dark heart of pure integrity in a very dangerous world.Another surprise: I wasn't a big fan of Mary McDonnell's Laura Roslyn in the pilot, but here she---and the character---really come into their own. I'm not sure what it is: less simper, more gravity, whatever it is, it's solid. It made me protective of her. And Baltar, particularly Baltar, provides the highest fun/episode quotient: his disintegrating act is one of the funniest spectacles in TV history.Best of all, there is no filler here: the smart writing and taut pacing covers all of the bases, whether it's the terror of the chase and mounting exhaustion against an implacable foe in ""33"", the mounting paranoia of ""Water"", the hilarity---and deep unease---of ""Tigh me Up"" and ""Six Degrees"", and the kidney punch of ""Kobol's Last Gleaming."" Rymer draws up Mankind at the brink, and the duplicity, tension, & terrorism are all too evocative of our own post-9/11 Age of Unease.""BSG"" is smart, slick, and devilishly entertaining stuff.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A14ET1IZB8N855	"Darren Sisco ""world or warcraft goober"""	"This is the only other series besides Band of Brothers to make me well up with tears.  Pay no attention to fan boys hiding behind Firefly curtains.  BSG is a very gritty dramatic show which is based more on the reality of concepts that we have today which hits close to home.  One aspect that really tickles me is the integration of the 12 horoscope signs as well as points from the original series.  I feel like even now in the 3rd season that they are holding many of thier aces for other seasons.  They keep continuity for the most part and have fantastic characters developed right at the start.  Sure they pull a few strings to help the plot along but which series hasn't?  I love every type of science fiction space shows but the actors have always been the achillies heel always bringing them down a notch.  Not true with BSG, every episode is like a movie and there are many underlying ideals bouncing around making for surprises at every corner.  Just like watching X-files wondering when and if the cancer man will let loose a secret or send us on another wild goose chase.People like to complain about the 'problems' they see with BSG, but remember this: this was the first season!  They are working out the bugs and making improvements just like all other series based in space or ""Melrose Place"".  The first season of ST:TNG was hoky, even with 90's standards, along with many seasons afterwards.  ST:Enterprise also had a rough start but was the best fare so far from Paramount's ailing series after 4 tries.  What killed Firefly was the networks mixing up the episodes that were already out of order.  A first season fubar that killed a great series.I'm giving this review well into season 3 and I can tell you this is how I felt when I first watched it and its how my friends feel after I told them how good it is.  I look forward for every episode to come on the tele and out on DVD for me to watch over and over again! I highly recommend this series to be on your DVD shelf even if your not a sci-fi fan.(even my wife who is a hardened drama addict/critic can't help but watch it while I'm watching it.  She tries her best to make fun but I can see her cracking under pressure with every episode she sees.  It will only be a matter of time before I brainwash her into a BSG nut too!)"	5.0	Awesome Series!	2006-02-05	15	15	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2I2DE1DJUVQOO	DarthRad	The first disc, the opening episodes that laid the background for this series, was fascinating.But, as the series progressed, some things really started to annoy me.A problem carried over from the original series in the 1980's - how could they start off with 20 old Vipers, lose several in each episode, and keep flying and fighting?  That part really bugged me about the old series, and remains a fundamental flaw of the whole concept.President Roslin - wow, a hard bitten Starship captain takes orders from the former Secretary of Education, with the fate of the fleet and all of humanity in doubt.  Yeah, right.  Not only that, she acts like a Bill-less version of Hillary Clinton, with an equally grating, nails-on-a-blackboard personality.  Ouch, it just got to be increasingly painful to watch her in action.Baltar - how come nobody ever notices that this guy is behaving so weird?  How come everybody keeps trusting him and puts key decisions in his hands?  How come nobody suspects him of being a Cylon?  And that British accent is so annoying.Cylons - they are so good at infiltrating the humans.  Why infiltrate them with defective models that question their purpose?  What the heck is all this talk about God, etc.?  Hybrids?  Way too weird.  Do they want to annhilate humans or create a new race, what?  Surely a toaster can't be too confused about its goals in life.All in all, better than than the average fluff that's on TV, but flawed.Update:  Now that we have Sarah Palin on our national landscape, and Hilary has faded, it's time to update this review to say that President Roslin resembles Governor Palin even more than Hillary did.  Talk about a complete neophyte suddenly being handed the controls to weapons of mass destruction, and having to make decisions that could change the fate of all humanity!!!  Same grating, nails-on-a-blackboard personality also (shudder).  The main difference:  Hillary's late efforts to morph into a gun-toting redneck were utterly silly, Sarah Palin is the real thing already.Update 2:  Sarah Palin thankfully fades from the scene, but Hillary makes a comeback!  And is soon to be Secretary of State, and fourth in the line of succession....	3.0	Interesting, but flawed, and eventually tiresome	2008-04-20	13	3	10

As they search for the legendary planet Earth, the Cylons move secretly toward a goal as yet unrevealed.This reimagining of a mediocre science fiction show from the 70s is top notch television, dark and gritty with a large cast of compelling characters.  Edward James Olmos as Captain Adama and Mary McDonnell as President Laura Roslin, the leaders of the military and civilian factions of the fleet, generate much of the drama with a wary yet respectful relationship that nevertheless threatens to fracture the fleet.  Other cast members who stand out include Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck, a renegade pilot whose is torn between her loyalty to Adama and her faith in Roslin, Michael Hogan as Col. Tigh, the alcoholic and incompetent second-in-command who is keenly aware of his own faults, and James Callis as Dr. Gaius, whose betrayal of the human race and connection to the Cylons remains undetected.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A15IQNTQX7QYQA	"David W. Shelton ""David W. Shelton is a write..."	"As I reflect on the sheer depth of the story that BSG has told thus far, I cannot help but be awed by the simplicity, yet complex nature of it.I remember reading of the abject hate that was being hurled at Ronald D. Moore when Sci-Fi announced that he was to ""reimagine"" the beloved, yet short-lived series.  Moore was quoted as saying there was great potential in the story.  Critics came through the woodwork demanding that he leave well-enough alone.""Starbuck a woman?""  Damn right.  Moore has taken several liberties, yet kept a few standards.  Gone are the lasers and sword-wielding Cylon drones.  They have been replaced by CGI drones with sexy and all-too-human Cylon models that understand humanity all too well.  The lasers have been replaced by bullets that only enhance the story in their brutal realism.Yes, it's about the STORY.  Moore has created a story that is rich with religion and history, but most importantly, a revelation of humanity, warts and all.  The dialogue is real, the awkwardness is genuine, and the stress of the day-to-day operations of the rag-tag fleet is through the roof.Season 1, while entirely too short, was a story that deeped the relationships of our beloved characters. Oh, and that ""woman Starbuck?"" She's easily the best character of the show; a gifted pilot, yet flawed.  No one can hold a candle to her. And her deepest wound is on her heart.  Her confession to Adama was one of the most profound scenes Season 1 offered.Yes, there are great special effects.  The battle scenes are eye-popping in their realism and brutality.  But in the end, it's about the story.  Good writing and good storytelling will create a mythos that transcends time and space, and when it's rich in character development and a revelation of the human condition, it becomes something even more.  It's deeper than ""morality shows.""  It's far more rich than any political message of current events.Its heart is centered around faith; faith that humanity will eventually get its collective head out of its ass.  But the reality is that deep in the core of the story, there's the understanding that true enlightenment isn't very likely.  But the hope is there.Stories like BSG draw the viewer deep into its heart, and for an hour each week, we feel like we're a part of it.  It becomes OUR story.  There's a little of Starbuck, Apollo, and yes, even a little bit of Baltar, and God help us, Boomer, in each of us.Thank you, Mr. Moore.  You've enriched my Friday nights.

The story in a nutshell is as follows: Humans created intelligent robots called Cylons who turned on them and wiped almost all of them out. About 50,000 humans survive and are under constant attack by the Cylons. In addition to battling (but mostly fleeing) the Cylons, there are power struggles and intrigue among the survivors.The strong cast is led by Oscar nominees Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell who give terrific performances as a Commander and President respectively. The other actors (with the exception of one...) are also great.Battlestar Galactica's characters are complex and dynamic. Their behaviour is not always predictable but always makes sense in light of what we know about their values, and the experiences and traumas they've been through. Family, friendship, romantic love and loyalty play a key role throughout the series.The overarching plot builds in a satisfying and steady manner. Plot details that may appear insignificant often turn out to be very important later on in the season. There are a lot of surprises but the writers lay the proper groundwork; so although surprising, the developments don't come out of absolutely nowhere. The writers have obviously done some solid planning.This series is worthy of your time and money. It is challenging, thrilling, intriguing, and emotionally riveting. If it maintains its quality in season 2, it will go down as one of the finest shows ever produced.	5.0	A riveting drama	2005-08-23	32	30	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1PHS6WM6V04ML	Devin	Battlestar Galactica was first released on the Sci-Fi channel as a mini-series, with the intent of creating a spin-off series assuming the 3-hour pilot was well-recieved. So, after seeing several commercials, I decided that I'd give the mini-series a try.Days after Battlestar Galactica ended, I found myself praying, and hoping that there was enough response to justify a weekly television show. The Mini-Series in itself was phenomenal, especially  for being on a low budget.Battlestar Galactica tells the story of what could be America-In-Space. It's almost a metephor of our modern-day nation, set to the backdrop of a classic story. Commonly, the writers tackle (without being too calloused) issues like terrorism, abortion, and issues of morality.Everything in the series is done with prestine accuracy. Realism is one of the keys in the show. Set designs a near perfect, and the special effects the *best* I've ever seen on televsion.While all of this is well and good, we all know that they can't stand alone. And they don't. Battlestar Galactica has some of the *best* script-writers in modern televsion. By the end of season one, you're left screaming for more. The attention to character development along with plot is great.All in all, if you're even remotely a fan of the original star treks, or if you love show's like 24, or it's various other counter-terrorism spin-offs... or even if you like political drama... heck, you know what? I'm gonna drop the list... if you like *anything* remotely connected to televsion, you at least owe this series a rent... if not a buy.	5.0	The Best of Sci-Fi	2006-08-04	7	3	4

I have the UK version, because I heard the packaging was a bit more robust and I didn't want scratched discs.I had never seen Battlestar Galactica when it was on TV, and literally just concluded watching season 1 on HD DVD for the 1st time ever.  I don't consider myself a hard-core sci-fi fan, though I enjoy shows such as Doll House, Firefly and some others, for their fusion of various genres (futuristic drama, etc), I had discussed the show with long time fans, and see now where the disappointment in the transfer is coming from. I know fans were awaiting a major upgrade and unfortunately, though clear and detailed in some scenes, it was very noisy and grainy in most. I have over 300 HD DVD's, and 300 BD's, and this is one of the poorest transfers I've seen so far. The True HD soundtrack however works, and becomes very effective during chase, fighting and scenes with multiple layers of voices, background sound, and music.I enjoy the humor and underlying religious and philosophical implications of the show, as well as the overarching theme of man vs machine, how far man will go,based on ""hope"" alone, and the general instincts of survival, despite a fusion between man and machine.Visually the series was very interesting to me. The space ship design, especially with the humanistic elements of being alive, and the militaristic prowess was appealing, as was the equality among the sexes. In addition the set design, costumes, and even the sounds of the space ships flying was very convincing. Some of the sets looked overly ""staged"", but the characters are likeable and powerful, and the consistent struggle of humans trying to maintain their humanity, and distinguish themselves from the machines trying to eradicate them.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	APQB2FOMSBMAL	Doctor A.	After reading the many rave reviews, I was expecting a series with genuine substance... or at least some real entertainment value. If you liked Independence Day or Armageddon, you'll probably love Battlestar Galactica. Each of these productions offer obvious plots, one-dimensional characters, and focus on bombastic special effects to carry the message.Sadly, productions of this genre offer little more than mindless titillation. Brainless offerings like this pale in comparison to Sci-Fi greats like Star Trek the Next Generation, Star Wars, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. The supposedly campy gimmicks -- like 20th century navigation tools complete with old-tech light tables, grease pencils and Corvette analog dial gauges -- serve more to insult the viewer's intelligence than enrich the story. Battlestar Galactica simply adds to the current heap of meaningless trivia from which America amuses itself to death.	1.0	Amusing Ourselves To Death	2011-02-09	37	11	26

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"Battlestar Galactica is a show about the last reminants of a war-stricken mankind, fleeing across space from an army of murderous robot ""Cylons"" (some of whom can pass as human), trying to find the location of their species' mythical ""lost colony""--Earth.It is a remake of a series by the same name from the late 1970s. It is a much different, and to my mind superior, show.Battlestar Galactica is different from its predecessor in that it is gritty. You will find very few light-hearted moments, here. Most everything is in dark tone, and when the show films in sunlight it is always a harsh, angry light. The series does an admirable job of showing us a humanity at its wit's end, harrassed and on the verge of extinction. True, there aren't many laughs, but there is a whole lot of engrossing, engaging drama.The casting is marvelous; every player does a great job and especially Adama. The decision to ""make Starbuck female"" (Starbuck was played by A-Team alumnus Dirk Benedict in the original) doesn't feel out of place at all. The editing, scoring, special effects and, in short, all of the technical elements conspire to produce visceral, engaging material right up until the heart-stopping cliffhanger that ends the season.The original series didn't run for very long (78-79); it was enjoyable, and with one of the best themes for any series ever, but it was too campy to survive. This show completely sheds its camp background and instead produces hard-hitting, thought-provoking science-fiction. We can only hope that, as it has outstripped its predecessor's quality, it can also surpass it in longevity."	5.0	An Excellent Sci-Fi Series; An Improvement on the Original	2006-04-03	4	2	2

The concept of the whole process, does not give away the ending, but certainly alludes to some fantastic possibilities. Those who subscribe to the theories of the New Age Spirituality, will certainly find something in these episodes for them interestingly enough. Some of the acting is a little overdone, and confusion which sometimes halts  the flow of the story is the reason for the 4 instead of five stars.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1VX6VPXNQTNUP	Dr. Richard G. Petty	"I do not normally write reviews about movies or television programs: there are plenty of excellent reviews already out there by people who specialize in them, and nobody needs an extra one.But this unique show is a great deal more than an adventure series, and the science fiction is no more than a backdrop. This is a show that plays with the key archetypes of the human mind and not only gets away with it, but teaches us something in the process.It's always easy to read things into a show, to do a bit of projection, to see things that aren't really there. Sometimes that's the intention of the artist: to let our own imaginations run wild. And I'm sure that this show will spawn a few dissertations. But in the meantime, there are things from which we can all learn.From the outset it makes no bones about its mythical origins: twelve colonies corresponding to the twelve signs of the zodiac. Gods from a planet called Kobol (the ""Kolob"" of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?); Adama becomes known as Zeus and Laura Roslin as Hera. There is a Trickster, a Wounded Healer, a Wise Woman and half a dozen other archetypes that occupy the stage. The Cylons turn on humanity like the Golem of the Jewish mythology of the Middle Ages.Yet this remains a superb story of adventure, daring and redemption. One of the strongest things about the presentation of the stories is that they come across not so much as a thrilling narrative, but as documentary. The choppy camera work adds a sense of realism that I have rarely seen before in fiction. None of the characters is all white or all black. They are complex creatures who don't always do the things that we expect of them. They hurt, they bleed, they suffer and usually they triumph. Though sometimes they win only at great personal cost. Unlike most books and movies in the genre, the character development is gradual, and we often learn unexpected things about the characters' pasts.Others have commented that Edward James Olmos was born to play the part of Adama, and they are right. I remember his brooding presence in the original TV series of Miami Vice providing a perfect foil to Crockett and Tubbs.I am interested in music and film that does a lot more than entertain, but can teach and inspire us. It has often been said that the writing of shows that do that are guided by spiritual teachers. Or perhaps the writers are just taken a crash course in mythology, ancient astronaut theories and the works of Carl Jung. Whichever is true, the first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica are a unique show that could do a great deal more than simply stirring your blood."	5.0	Battlestar Galactica: The Documentary	2007-03-14	9	7	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A73ASI9A6P4HB	dr_rsc	What with all the anticipation over this 're-imagining' by the moore-eick team, I was looking forward to this series.The redo of the series was done well. That is if one likes dark, sci-fi. In the extras, it was mentioned several times that this was to be a character-driven show that happens to be in space. This was largely true. There is the requisite sexuality, somewhat overdone as the target audience apparently is that of science fiction in general, white males 13 to 35. There is however, much for people in other demographic groups to like as well. The change of Starbuck from Dirk Benedict's overgrown rascal, to the troubled, impressionable, yet violently assertive woman was...a good thing. My wife, who dislikes all sci-fi, finds the new Starbuck character very interesting. She, my wife that is, has never asked to watch the dvds though.If one was looking for a continuation or an update of the 70's program they are going to be disappointed. This series only shares the title, premise and some of the characters' names from the original show. The best way to enjoy the new Battlestar Galactica is to take it on its own merits. It is something that is meant not for the whole family but for those with a more 'mature' sensibility. (note the quotation marks: they were intentional as BSG is a good program, no doubt about it - a milestone in sci-fi, maybe - a great dramatic series: that it probably is not, at least not what I have seen - it does have great moments though)A paragraph should be set aside for the characters of the program themselves. Adama, the leader or rather the commander of the warship, Battlestar Galactica, is ably interpreted by Edward James Olmos. His portrayal somehow is similar to his character from Miami Vice. Not much but some. President Roslin, the former 'Secretary of Education' forced into accepting the office of president of the colonies, is a character that seems to be a combination of parts from the old series. Mary McDonnell, as always, does the part with aplomb. For those interested, check out the movie 'Passion Fish' - she was great in that. Katie Sackhoff must be doing a fantastic job with her character to get the reaction my wife gave, considering my wife is not fond of any sci-fi. Jamie Bamber must be an incredible actor to be doing a sort-of channeling of Mark Hamill. But what is even more incredible is how he can keep the consistency of his accent. That is no small task. Tricia Helfer, whose character is '6' (flashback to a truly groundbreaking series by genius Patrick McGoohan, The Prisoner), seems to do a very workmanlike job portraying the semi-organic being in all of it's (the character's that is) manifestations. In the interview portion of the dvd, she looks a lot better than in the program. But then, it is just a part. Grace Park is so cute that it is hard to take the Boomer character seriously. You just sort of want to pat her on the head and say, 'good kid, be careful you don't skin your knees outside'. She plays the part very well, however. Its too bad she doesn't get the chance to be meaner though. Kandyse McClure does the part of Dualla to perfection, as does Tahmoh Penikett with the Helo character.The character of Colonel Tigh is a subject that many seem to forget about. Michael Hogan's portrayal of the flawed man is just about perfect. The character of Tigh seems to be a man who lacks confidence and tends to be self-destructive when stressed. However, he, the character that is, does come through when the going is tough. It is gratifying that the producers have seen fit to allow more complexity to a character than is typical in most television. The other parts, Adama, Rosalin, Apollo, and a few others, seems as though they could just about be in any adventure or sci-fi series. Tigh, however, is another sort altogether. Tending to err on the side of caution as far as his, Tigh's that is, command style, he often jumps the gun. This would have prevented him from ascending to any elevated rank in any military organization. But, Adama brought him onboard in spite of this. Perhaps this is something we shall see in season three? The Tigh and Baltar characters are probably the main reasons I find this series very watchable.Something more needs to be said about the Gaius Baltar part as played by James Callis. The original Baltar as done by John Colicos was an unscrupulous, conniving, opportunistic character whose shortcoming was the conviction that if he could not rule humanity, then they should be brought low until they accept his vision of their fate. The character as played by Mr. Callis, is written very differently. This was of course a necessity. The villian could not possibly be a monomaniac as was in the original series. That just would not fly nowadays. In this era of 'complexity' and trying to understand why people do bad things, someone like that who never learns their lesson wouldn't work even if that is a common enough ocurrence in reality. But there is more to the new Gaius Baltar than that. Partly this is due to the '6' character, whose invisibility hearkens back to Harvey (a Jimmy Stewart flick where only he can see this giant white rabbit...you would have to see the movie to understand). Partly due to the incredible discipline of the other actors in scenes that involve Callis, Helfer and whomever else. But mainly it is due to the very complex writing, direction and the masterful protrayal of Baltar by Callis. For myself, above and beyond anything else, it is the Baltar character's peculiar weaknesses and motivations that make Battlestar Galactica worth watching. That is not to say that there is nothing else on the program, far from it.The visual effects, cgi, compositing and all are excellent. You would expect no less nowadays. The acting is a very, very professional. But that is a given with younger actors on the set with veterans such as Olmos and McDonnell. The writing is pretty good, but I would hope that the script supervisor or whomever is responsible would try to keep excessive 'emoting' from creeping into the show. The scene of Adama weeping over and onto the corpse of the version of Boomer who was shot by the Cally (? not sure of the spelling) character was puzzling, especially considering his later detestation of another version of Boomer.One special note: the intro music for the individual programs on the dvds was awful! The intro music on the programs on Sky One was far, far, far superior. Even my wife was moved to comment on the bizarre nature of the 'mood' music of the beginning of each episode. The lack of a decent theme is a drawback. I hope the producers, Moore and Eick, can see fit to either get the music from the televised Sky One put on as the intro track for the programs or pay the bucks to have a competent film composer do something for the show.	4.0	pretty good	2005-12-23	6	5	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A6LUXI8I8BU6P	"D Strick ""Entertainment D"""	The new Battlestar Galactica does what a successful remake should do.  It pays tribute to the old and then improves upon it.  The basic premise of the rag tag fleet looking for the 13th colony of Earth is there with a small core of cool Viper fighers based on the Galactica to protect them from the evil Cylons.  With that as the base they've added a whole new dimension of charaters and interactions and updated the bad guys to a real threat.First the characters appear come first in this show.  Complex and egaging, they hold interest easily.  Who cares if Starbuck is now a girl, she's so cool.  And Dr. Baltar is now a guilt ridden phyco who talks with what may or may not be an imaginary Cylon in is head who happens to be a hot blonde.The Cylons themselves have evolved the most.  Now a creation of man that turned on him they are CG created mechanical monsters with guns on their wrists.  The creaters of the show don't put special effects first but you can actually be scared of these Cylons.  But also, now they have built human looking Cylons who can be anyone and even have sleeper agents who don't even know they are Cylons until too late.  Oh snap!

White	The acting, writing, cinematography, and special effects of this series were so well balanced and of such quality that this series set a high standard for not only SciFi series, but TV series in general.Luckily this is nothing like the original campy BSG series from the 80's w/it's robot dogs and silly characters.  It has strong serious and dark elements while remaining utterly enjoyable and compelling to watch week after week. (Or episode after episode in this case.) Exciting plot twists and turns, unexpected (yet reasonable and believable) character and relationship changes, and a willingness to put even central characters on the chopping block.This really is one you should not miss.	5.0	Just about the best SciFi series ever on TV...	2012-09-04	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AFEIAWRKOG3K2	Dyemat	"I did not get to see this series when it aired on tv but heard great things about it.  I was impressed by the familiarity yet newness of the show. Gone are the cheesy Egyptian helmets, bad hair, and weak graphics.  They have been replaced by a more complex societal structure with a background history of who the cylons are and what started the exodus for earth. The toaster-head cylons have been replaced with tougher nasty metal ones and human simulacrums (but the slang for cylon is toasterhead!).  This show has alot of flawed characters, no more so than Dr.Gaius Baltar who was very one dimensional in the original but is quite schizophrenic in the new one.  At the end of each show I was always left wondering ""what next?"", it is definitely a good series - especially if you like Firefly.  If you buy this you might as well buy the 2 parts of season 2 and save some time and shipping!"	5.0	A new old series	2007-05-13	2	2	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A38B15NPZQ4VEX	Eagle 1	It's hard to keep watching Galactica without popping Space 1999 into the DVD player instead. Space 1999 was largely free of the pointless repetitive angst of twenty-something characters and it wasn't just plain dreary over and over. Battlestar is just too repetitive and limited in it's scope. Space 1999 was a far more diverse series that could be light, dark, gripping, outlandish, claustophobic, incredibly expansive, and imaginative. On Space 1999 there were endless explorations of new worlds, cultures, universes, and beings. Anything could happen. SPACE 1999 HAD IT ALL. The same can't be said of Battlestar. It's far more restricted and hits the same notes over and over. Give Space 1999 a try instead.	3.0	not Space 1999	2006-02-02	33	6	27

With the exception of the one episode where they reintroduced the XO's wife this was perfection.  This sets the bar quite high for Sci Fi.I always liked the Babylon 5 series for gritty realism but this tears that off the wall of fame and tosses it in the ditch.I still cannot believe that someone could remake that dorky 1970's BSG and turn it into something so cool.I am so going to dig getting season 2 & 3 off netflix or wherever until I catch up.Many thanks to the many pitches on Ebert & Robert, especially Kevin Smiths pitch during a guest host spot where he pushed season 2.5 really hard.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Fifty years ago, humanity's robotic servant Cylons suddenly turned on their masters. After a nasty war, the Cylons retreated into far space and a tense truce was maintained.But of course the story doesn't stop -- and it turned out to be a rare case of a remake becoming spectacularly better than the source material. ""Battlestar Galactica Season"" is a grimy, dark sci-fi/adventure saga that isn't afraid to dip into philosophical and theological matters -- and it's also well-acted (mostly) and emotionally powerful.Forty years after the war's end, the Cylons unexpectedly return to the Twelve Colonies and start wiping out ships and cities. The Battlestar Galactica (an aging warship about to be turned into a museum) is forced to flee the world of Caprica with a collection of refugee-crammed ships, under the command of Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and Secretary of Education-turned-President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell).Now the people of the Twelve Colonies must find a new home -- and their new goal is Earth, a legendary planet with other humans on it. Unfortunately, they have been infiltrated by the treacherous scientist Gaius Baltar (James Callis), and a group of Cylons who are almost indistinguishable from human beings.But the journey is the real test -- the ragtag fleet must deal with sabotage, shortages of water and fuel, Starbuck's stranding on a deadly planet, treachery among their numbers, attacks on Cylon-held asteroids, political crises and captured Cylons. What's more, someone on the Galactica is actually a Cylon -- leading to a terrible confrontation....Anyone expecting ""Battlestar Galactica"" to be a copy of its predecessor is going to be horribly disappointed. This is sci-fi at its most compelling and transcendent -- a gritty, bleak, sexual, dark story of war and desperate escapes, and there are plenty of moral dilemmas (leaving behind slower ships to the Cylons). And it knows how to chill you -- the premiere miniseries has a ghastly scene where Six quietly snaps a tiny baby's neck... and she's trying to be merciful.The writers also do a solid job in here, emphasizing the hard sci-fi but starting to add some mystical threads near the end. The writing is solid with some bleakly humorous moments (""Why can't we use the starboard launch tube?"" ""It's a gift shop now""). They even manage to pull off dramatic and powerful dialogue without being cheesy (""You were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered. Your life is a testament to pain. Injuries. Accidents. Some inflicted upon others, others inflicted upon yourself"").Oh, and by the by, the first season includes the initial miniseries, so no need to buy it separately. It's nice to not have to wait to get the miniseries before knowing what's going on.Olmos and McDonnell are the powerful leaders in this story, and both actors do a brilliant job -- especially Mcdonnell with Roslin's terminal breast cancer, and Olmos with his tragic past. Katee Sackhoff's Starbuck comes across as annoyingly more-macho-than-thou in many episodes, but the actress does a fine job in the deeper, more powerful moments --  Tricia Helfer is excellent as  the ethereal humanoid-Cylon Number Six.Other standouts: Callis as the ever-changing Baltar, an enigmatic man with charisma and incredible smarts; Michael Hogan as the unlikeable Saul Tigh; and Grace Park as a woman who may be a Cylon without even being fully aware of it.""Battlestar Galactica Season One"" (including the miniseries) is the start of a strong, powerful sci-fi epic, and definitely deserves to be seen.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1RD3CBVXK1YTW	Ed	"This is an excellent show. The writing, directing, acting, production, everything is superb! It is extremely well crafted(I love the handycam space dogfights!), the plot is better, the continuity is better, the character development is better, the acting is better, the directing is better than the original 70's series. If you consider yourself a snob when it comes to watching quality film, this will not disappoint you. Clearly, anyone criticizing this show is defending their childhood nostalgia generated from memories of the original. The only gripe I have about these/any TV show DVD season sets is how they always put the, ""previously on Battlestar Galactica"" scenes always at the beginning of each episode. You always have to fast forward over these to get to the start of the Episode, you cant just press the Next Chapter button on the remote, because you miss the beginning of the episode!(the part before the theme song intro, which is another annoying segment that is on every episode, strip both of these things off DVD sets! I only want to see the beginning intro once at the beginning of the set!) This is extremely annoying when you want to watch the whole thing seamlessly like one big mega 800 minute film. Which is the only way to ever watch these DVD season sets, pick a weekend, clear your schedule, and watch this epic fantastic adventure! There's one episode in season 2 that I'd dare to say is even better than Star Wars! and I'm a way bigger star wars fan than you are! But you have to start with season one!

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A35AMPDFAB8JLT	Edmonson	"""Battlestar Galactica"" (2004) Season One was created by Glen Larson and developed by David Eick and Ronald Moore. The 3-hour mini series episode (2003) is included here that begins with a civilization of humans who live on planets in a distant part of the galaxy. These Colonies had been at war with a cybernetic race known as Cylons which were originally created by humans. The series starts off with a surprise ambush by the Cylons after an armistice of many years. The planets and their people are devastated and the survivors have either sought refuge aboard spaceships, one of which is the Battlestar Galactica, or are operating in guerilla units on the planets. This military science fiction series is lead by William Adama (Edward James Olmos) who is the commander of the Battlestar Galactica. This series is reminiscent of James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (1986) with its dark brooding atmosphere and military emphasis. The series also has a religious flavour with the humans mostly practicing a form of polytheism and the Cylons monotheism, though the lead character, Adama, the admiral of the Battlestar Galactica, as well as some others, are agnostic or atheists.  The human gods have names like Hera, Athena, Apollo, and Zeus, which were the same names used by the Greeks from the classical and Hellenistic periods. In another parallel to Western polytheism the names of the human colonies (12) and their planets are similar to the names of the constellations in the Greco-Roman zodiac.This 4 disc blu-ray set is in 1080p with a widescreen 1.78:1 aspect ratio, and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 with French or Spanish subtitles. The special features are in 1080i/p HD and 480i/p SD and English Dolby Digital 2.0. This set also includes  feature commentaries and behind the scene featurettes and deleted scenes, seen on the DVD set. This set also has U-Control features. This is a elegant, and well packaged box set. The only caveat is that the 3-hour mini series doesn't look noticeably different than it did on DVD since it was filmed in a lower resolution than the first season episodes. For those with HD watching the season episodes will be like seeing the series for the first time again."	5.0	Excellent TV series in HD	2010-01-26	13	10	3

The politic thing is brainless specially when you thing they should be worry in survive than put every choice in someone who doesn't really know about the real truth meaning of the war.There many science mistakes (including the bad weapons they use when they have good engines to jump to another sector), the Boomer storyline it's just a waste of time, specially at the end of season when they found halo, who could be a great story (if they didn't found him).The soundtrack it's just a child's work, Richard Gibb could do something good but the whole soundtrack it's poor not only in time also in imagination as the whole show.Ronald D Moore have a whole universe to create new things, new theories but he let all behind for a few stupid things (the political theme, and boomer's love story).I hope the new season make some changes.	1.0	Boring, Stupid, Lack of Imagination	2005-08-19	91	13	78

However, it would be strongly recommended that this not be presented to children; the drama, the character interplay and the intimacies therein are highly charged, sometimes graphic, sometimes base, and sometimes beautific in nature, but all very mature, if not borderng on the sensually debauched. Although I believe this has to be one of the best choreographed science fiction series of all time, particularly the writing and character interaction, all said, this is one of the most intelligent representations for its Genre. However, buyer beware, this is definately not at all for children, or even for some adults, as it contains extremely sensual or sexually explicit scenes, and the label does not mention this, it just states ""unrated""."	4.0	Gripping and intense entertainment	2009-01-29	2	2	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1N7CLMHL8GX47	E. Johnson	Heres the scoop. The reimagining of the series has been monsterously successful. Battlestar always had a great concept but was wrongly percieved by many as a Star Wars rip off. The new series vindicates one of science fictions best concepts by taking things very very seriously. Chances are you have already seen the series in some form if you're even considering buying it. Those who havent should know that they are going to get an uncompromising, occasionally grim, and very very human story very well told. The producers are Star Trek alums and specifically seek to avoid the problems that have crippled that franchise. So the series minimizes the technobabble and instead tells a very human tale filled with alot of heart and pain, it's occasionally brutal but always maintains an exceptional amount of quality whose warm moment ring suprisingly true. Non scifi folks may be surprised to find themselves enjoying it.Beyond the episodes this is a great package because there is a ton of commentary. About 75% of the episodes have it and it is some of the best and most thorough I have seen. You get a ton of info about the goals of the show, explanations for why things went the way they did, and very honest examinations of the problems that plague scifi tv in general. You will learn more about Star Trek and similar series than you ever expected. These guys are real geeks but focused and have some really amazing input. The commentary alone is worth purchase.Beyond that there is about an hour of deleted scenes. These include about twenty minutes of extras surrounding the first regular season episode. There are some great little chestnuts here, almost all the deleted stuff is of exceptional quality. Thats a real surprise, most deleted material is crap, but the stuff Battlestar throws away is better than what most first run science fiction broadcasts.There is also documentaries, mostly repackaged promo material. Nothin to lose sleep over. Alongside Deadwood and Rome, this is the best show on TV as of fall 2005 and the extras are excellent.	5.0	Great stuff, both the series and the extras....	2005-10-03	14	14	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1FNCHRTYGMSW0	Elena B	No show has to deal with the level of hatred that the new re-imagined version of Battlestar Galactica does. There is a rabid group of original series fans who simply can't accept changes like having Starbuck be a woman and will come up with ridiculous reasons to trash the new series. For example, they may claim that the plot moves too slowly. On the contrary, Battlestar Galactica moves faster than comparable shows with a long over-arching storyline like Lost, Alias, X-Files, etc.If you're open-minded about the alterations and a fan of smart, character-driven dramas, Battlestar Galactica will certainly appeal to you.The show is about what happens when humans creates very intelligent machines and the machines turn on them. It is not typical sci-fi. It's not about technology (besides the intelligent 'bots), discovering new worlds or aliens.It's about humans and how they deal in a time of intense crisis when everything they know is destroyed and they have to run, fight for their lives, make difficult choices, reestablish a society and find hope.This show is actually not as bleak as it sounds. The writers manage to inject some levity into the show (which does not destroy the dark overall tone.)Battlestar Galactica is very character driven. All the characters seem like real, breathing people and they grow, change and have relationships. As other reviewers have already mentioned, the show is critically acclaimed and for good reason.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1CHOKV10NEI8X	"E. M. Van Court ""Van"""	"From the start, this is not the original Battlestar Galactica.  The new one is vastly improved.  The original series was good, but thirty years of improvements in special effects shows, and the quality of the actors' performance is superior in every way.  I'm very impressed that this one went into a second season, as shows of this quality usually don't last.The miniseries and series are very powerful, skillfuly weaving several threads in a balanced and coordinated fashion.  The characters are fairly well developed from the offset, and only acquire greater depth as the series progresses.  The single most striking aspect of the series is its intensity.  I did not see the series broadcast, and it is likely that commercial interruptions reduced the power of the series.  Without the breaks, however, each episode builds upon the last, introducing hints of future events and enhancing the depth of the stories that are developed.The characters are flawed, given to human failings, under tremendous pressure, well thought out, and extremely engaging.  Personally, I like LT Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace the best, even though I've dealt with service members who tried to behave like that and needed to be put out of the military to preserve the professionalism of the officer corps.  She's got issues, but generally doesn't let them interfere with duty, she's competent enough that folks will cut her some slack, and she knows her limits.  Dr. Gaius Baltar is facinating in the same way as DeSade, he's the personification of a self-indulgent, self-serving genius, and embodies the greatest failings of human kind, while being utterly charming about it.  The civilian leader of the fleet, President Broslin is wonderfully portrayed, as she grows into her new position.  Commander Adama, the military leader of the fleet, is a man paying for a failure to balance career and family and other family issues, and trying to manage problem subordinates while still fulfilling his duties.  Of course, this is complicated by Cylon infiltrators....Any more will head towards spoilers, and I'm sure some of you haven't seen the whole thing yet.This one is well worth watching and getting, but don't watch too much at one sitting."	4.0	Too good for prime time. too much without commercials	2005-11-03	8	8	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.Right off the bat, the show goes into very dark territory. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. People are people, so to speak. The characters have complex emotional journeys and have their shares of flaws. But nor does the show ever go so far as to make viewers dislike the characters (or root for the Cylons to win).Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.Having said that, I do feel at times that BSG didn't take enough time to build up some of the secondary characters during this first season. Characters such as the Chief and Cally became pretty important later on, but we have no reason to care about them. In the Star Trek series, often important secondary characters would receive treatment with an episode focused on them or their backstory, building the character up. However, BSG generally eschews episodes focused on a single character and instead pushes the larger plot forward. This means that most of the time episodes focus on Admiral Adama and President.The one don't particularly care for about the show was the Cylons as the main villains. To put it bluntly, they're boring and not particularly threatening after the first few episodes. The idea of biological machines is never really explained satisfactorily - the Cylons appear to be exact copies of humans, even feeling human emotions, and act nothing like machines. Yet, they're supposed to be machines bent on conquering humans? The male Cylons are portrayed as boring and dull while the female Cylons are either slutty or overly emotional.Cyborgs or machines impersonating humans can work to great effect when they are used as a plot device to talk about the human condition, as in Blade Runner or with Data in Star Trek, or about the dangers of technology. However, BSG doesn't take either approach - the Cylons are just a bunch of emo thugs with no discernible motivation.Overall, I like the series so far and definitely recommend watching the first season (the later seasons start to flail). It's an eerily compelling vision of a possible future for humanity.	5.0	gritty sci-fi at its best	2012-12-26	2	0	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AL639TTVGWE9M	"Enrique Fernandez Roberts ""Stray Dog and comm..."	Okay, so I bought the UK dvd set BEFORE I found out about the mini series not being included.  BUMMER.That said, I watched the show with complete ignorance, having only seen the original series (which I absolutely love by the way).  I watched one episode at 8 am on a Monday, and had to call into work for a sick day by the end of the episode.  WOW.First, the writing on this show is spectacular.  All of the characters are likeable, but have their troubles laid out before your very eyes.  Even the villains are compassionate and sympathetic, and this feels to me what the original series should have been.For example, the original Baltar was a comic book villain.  He was evil because he was greedy and liked being evil.  Not so this time around.  Baltar here betrays the world without knowing it, and spends much of the series inadvertantly saving the heroes.Edward James Olmos is out of site as Adama, and also takes the helm directing a few episodes.  This experienced character actor adds a great sense of comedic and dramatic timing, and seems to set the bar higher for the actors around him.Mary McDonnel adds to the talent of this series as the President of the colonial fleet, a character not included in the original series.  The addition of a civilian government leads to endless possibilities for the show, as well as a tremendous cameo by the guy who played Apollo in the original series.Jamie Bamber does a competent job as Apollo, with just the right amount of schoolboy charm and good looks to make you know that he is the main character, but without overdoing it.There are two break out stars from this series, Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck and the AMAZING Grace Park who plays Boomer.In the instance of Sackhoff, she is able to play Starbuck as an alcohol drinking, card playing, stogie smoking hotshot who also has a heart of gold, many demons inside and a talent for flying that is unmatched by any other.  Having been a really big fan of the original Starbuck, this was the character that most worried me.  I am pleased to say that, IMHO, this version of Starbuck is BETTER than the original.And Grace Park?  I am amazed that such a young, unkown and relatively untrained actress can keep up with her demanding character.  From the beginning we know that Boomer carries a deep secret, and this actress carefully walks us through the mind of this poor tortured character.The series itself has some of the best written dialogue of any show out there, and knows how to mix in enough subplots to make for a very addicting storyline.The tv show uses a similar style of directing its outer space sequences to the one that was made famous by Firefly.  There are lots of zoom in shots and really basic beats in the background to allow the viewer to focus on the action.I highly recommend this tv series for anyone who is a fan of science fiction, good drama, and of course, for those who like to see good looking women smoke cigars.	4.0	The UK Version Rocks, can't wait for the US Release	2005-08-25	42	39	3

Firefly is annoying lackluster, it has no soul or even charater developemtn, it never ever holds my interest even tho sic fi reboradcasts it, I don't see hwo it warrants a feature film ever. On the other hand galactica is a relevant piece of sci fi drama, don't think so, think hard about nuclear prolliferation and then watch the mini series opener, it will leave a very unsettling feeling in your gut.  All 13 episodes of the first season are amazingly well written, and when you watch the deleted scenes you'll see how masterfully they flesh out some things so they kept the suspense going, season 2 has been hit and miss but the season 2 final is gonna be awesome, i bought the uk version because of its collectablility, I'll buy this for the extra and well i can loan this one out LOLFRACKIN AWESOME	5.0	galactica is fresh entertaining and relevant	2005-09-23	17	5	12

We were converts after the first mini-series and have just finished season three.It's a well-written, well-acted show with tight story lines and great visual effects. I love that it's more about the people and their stories, their struggle for survival and not so much about space - I'm not a big Star Trek fan and this is not really at all like that except for the setting. Even if you're not a sci-fi fan, give this show a chance because I think it will surprise many people and draw most of them in.I can easily see why it was considered one of the best shows on television while it was airing. We're about to start Season 4 and I'm going to be sad when we finally finished the series.	5.0	Fantastic show	2013-01-07	0	0	0

Not only were half of my discs scratched due to the ridiculously cheap packaging, but the audio on disc 2 (the second part of the mini-series) was massively out-of-sync and therefore unwatchable.  This is perhaps my favorite show on tv, and to see a transfer that looked worse than my SDTV broadcast in some scenes along with the sync issues and scratching (and subsequent video skipping) is beyond inexcusable.  If you love BG, then you'll want to wait until Universal actually releases a quality Season 1 set instead of this tripe.	2.0	"""The look and sound of perfect""... yeah, right"	2007-12-17	5	5	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1PQLR0EN31PE8	E. Smith	I remember seeing the miniseries and being a fan of the old Battlestar Galatica, I was disappointed that the characters had changed so much.  Some changed genders and some even changed race.  But the cool thing about this is that this works very very well indeed.  The new Battlestar Galatica is updated in every aspect.  The characters are not as one dimensional as they were when the previous version of this show broadcasted in the 70's.  It's not so much of a good versus evil thing.  They all have flaws which adds so much depth, a thing you don't normally find in a sci-fi series.  Trust me as I say this, you have to watch the each episode, in a row.  They do not stand up independently like, say a show like Star Trek.  Because with this series, it is telling you a story with many many chapters. And who knows when the story will end but the journey is fascinating to me.  And I wrote all that without talking about the Special FX, thats how good the story is.  The special effects, which are top notch especially for television, will bring you to watch the series in the first place, the story will compell you to stay with it.  And thank god it is being broadcast on the Sci-Fi network, because in this day and age of instant gratification, a regular broadcast channel, say like FOX (Firestarter anybody?), will cancel a show like this because it's not an immediately ratings bonaza.But where would this show be without great writing and also extremely good acting by all involved.  Except for a couple of people (Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonell) the rest of the cast are practically a bunch of unknowns, yet they all pull off their characters so well.  If you are a fan of sci-fi, you will love this show.  If you are not a fan, I think you may get to really enjoy it, because its not all about space battles.  I hope more people watch this.  Thank god its not a carbon copy of Star Trek (Deep Space Nine, Andromeda, Babylon 5, Space Above and Beyond).

There's quite a lot of static left on the screen to approximate the ""film grain"" look of the show. However, how much static and the extent that it successfully mimics the grain can change, scene to scene, moment to moment.The opening sequence of the human negotiator meeting the Six for first time is amazingly bad. The bronze colored walls are practically popping with bright and dark flashes of static. This settles down as the show goes on and then disapears all together in some scenes, only to come back in others. There doesn't seem to be any sort of pattern to this as well. That is, dark scenes sometimes have lots of static, sometimes they don't. Scenes with a lot of visual effects are usually clean but then sometimes they don't.The audio is great however. Low frequency sounds are portrayed quite nicely which makes the soundtrack, sound effects and edward james olmos sound incredible.If you own the original SD set, this is a minor upgrade at best and hardly does justice to the show.edit: Disc 2 does suffer from a very noticable audio/video synch issue."	3.0	massively inconsistent	2007-12-12	4	4	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A369WIGCHUCMY9	"Eug ""Eug"""	"Battlestar Galactica is a reimagined version of the original series from the 1970s, but with a lot more substance and infinitely better acting. It even managed to win the prestigious Peabody award, among many others. I was anxiously awaiting this box set to come out in hi-def, and was very pleased to hear Universal came through for us in 2007.As expected, the original miniseries (shot on film) as well as some of the episodes (shot on high definition video) are grainy, but that was the directors' and producers' intent. In fact, I've been told that the episodes had additional grain added in post production to enhance this effect. Fortunately, the detail was well preserved on this release. Not only do we get the gritty look with the grain and the documentarian style, we also get fine details that simply are not present on the DVD. On the HD DVD, the image quality is a huge step forward compared to the DVD, not surprisingly.Unfortunately, there are some technical issues with the authoring of this set. For example on disc two at approximately 55'37"" in part 2 of the miniseries, there is a serious synchronization problem between the audio and the video for a short period. This is most obvious in the scene when one character is screaming at the other. This problem is not due to hardware, as it can be replicated on multiple different players, but appears to be due to improper authoring of the disc. Most of the rest of the set is properly synched, and therefore this problem may not be a huge concern for some people, but nonetheless this could be a deal-killer for some others.This box set had the chance to be THE collectors' archival set for fans of this series, but unfortunately it isn't, because of a simple technical issue that should have never been allowed to occur in any title, much less a relatively big TV release like this one.I give this release 5 stars for content but only 3 stars overall, because of the audio synchronization issue."	3.0	Great series, but some authoring issues	2008-01-12	1	1	0

Star Wars, Star Trek, V, comic books, Evangelion,Dune,...the list is long and the genre has being part of my formative years as and individual and continue to shape my adult life.And with this being true, I was getting very very disappointed with the current state of affairs in the sci-fi genre...the prequel Star Wars were sub-par, Star Trek was becoming dull...I turned my back on current sci-fi on tv and on the movies, and when I heard a new Battlestar Galactica was about to air I ignored it completely.I had never seen the original series (my only clue about it was loving the main theme music from that series wich I heard on a wonderful radio program about movies and television scores), so I decided no to waste my time on what my gut told me would be another dull show.Recently I decided to watch the mini-series out of boredom, and let me tell you I feel like a fool.I am currently catching up with the Television broadcast of what I am deeming as the most important Science Fiction show of recent history.Battlestar Galactica is a really bold statement about current political, military and religious issues on a very interesting space setting where the technological advances are very plausible and add to the overall tone of the series.It is bleak, it is dark, but it has hope. Every single character (either on the ""good"" side or the ""bad"" side or the ""enemy"" side) has flaws and good atrributes. You are constantly torn between characters you seem to ""like"" and decisions they undertake that might be deemed inmoral. This show really makes you question your stances regarding war, freedom and actions without being preachy or just ""one-sided."" The show glides between  ""heavy scenarios"" and more ""light ones"" and some very interesting personal interactions between the characters.At times it is ""soap-operish"" but never in a bad way (melodrama always work, if done right).Season 1 deals with the strains between the military and the struggling civil government in a moment of utter chaos, where humans try to maintain their humanity when basically they are facing extinction.It is really necessary to have a civilian government in such extreme conditions? Is the military capable of waging war and taking care of the civilians? How do you feel when your destruction is caused by something you created? Is there a bigger plan for everybody?That and many other questions are explored during this great start to a series that becomes more complex and more rewarding every time. In a world where TV and movies seem to get worst and worst it is really important to support such a bold show as this.Do not overlook this gem because of preconceptions, I am glad I finally gave it chance and today I am a less a fool for that."	5.0	Do believe the hype!	2007-02-16	2	2	0

I just started watching the new BSG and got sucked in immediately. I love, love, love science fiction movies, however I've never really been a fan of sci-fi TV shows. Star Trek TOS is really the only one I enjoy. So I was surprised just how enjoyable the new Battlestar Galactica series is. It's like a good Star Trek series, but with more drama and character development. Good stories, interesting characters, interesting premise, cool robot villains. Good stuff. The actors are good, the effects are good considering it's a TV show and not a big-budget movie, it's very well written with compelling storylines and well-developed characters.

It's every bit as riveting, carefully crafted, inspired, and full of first class acting as a feature film would be.

I don't know the original TV-show, which is probably a good thing, as it seems to prevent some people from enjoying this new show. Still, lots of people seem to agree, myself included, that the ""new"" Battlestar Galactica should be judged for itself, and not for its degree of ""loyalty"" to the old series (a question I just don't find very interesting). I personnally had to adjust to the format of the shorter episodes, as I've been so overwhelmed by the mini-series... but you get into it quickly, as the writers take advantage of the opportunity to tell a different story in every new episode, with fireworks of ideas masterfully arranged...This is how good a TV show can be.

Although I was a huge fan of the original when I was a child, as an adult I find the 1970s version of BSG cheesily produced, poorly written, unbelievably acted (despite all the ""name"" actors involved)... in short, all but unwatchable.So after letting the 2003 miniseries and entire first season of the new BSG pass by without a thought, I stumbled upon a re-run marathon on the SciFi channel, and decided to give it a shot. I wasn't sure I actually liked the show at first, but right off the bat I was intrigued by the complex interaction of its characters, the unique production design (such as the handheld camera look of the space scenes), and the truly bizarre Baltar storyline. And the show is INTENSE. After five or six episodes, I knew I was hooked for good.The only other science fiction series of the past ten years that's held my attention was ""Babylon 5,"" which was a very different show but had the same qualities I admire in the new BSG: a willingness to take risks, to put characters first, and to let a large story evolve slowly; and the ability to do so without getting dull or repetitive.No, it's not exactly ""fun"" most of the time; it's dark, sometimes depressing, sometimes frightening. But it's also pretty darn compelling. You will care about what's happening, and you'll want desperately to know what happens next."	4.0	The best sci-fi series in a decade	2005-09-08	33	29	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2VE83MZF98ITY	"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick"""	Having grown up on the old Battlestar Galactica and similar science fiction, I wasn't sure how I would react to this new series.In this series, with a few nods to the original ideas, there are still humans on twelve planets who have an advanced civilisation, but an aging military fleet. They've been at peace for twenty years, since the Cylons (here the humans' own creation) departed, having never signed a formal peace treaty. There is no peace conference here - rather, the aging battlestar Galactica is about to be decommissioned, when an unexpected attack by dramatically more advanced Cylons takes place, incorporating not only direct military strikes but also computer internet/network hijacking, facilitated by the mentally unbalanced but ingenious Dr. Baltar. Adama takes the Galactica to a safe location while the rest of the colonies fall quickly to the Cylons; various ships in the interstellar routes survive, including one with a cabinet minister elevated to the presidency due to the emergency, Laura Roslin. The ragtag fleet assembles at a forgotten supply depot, and does a sort of light-speed jump to safety after fighting (and essentially losing) against a new Cylon death star.There are small nods to the old series - on the Galactica preparing for decommissioning, a museum has been set up, which has models of old Cylon death stars (these are models from the original series). The specifications for Cylons show the old metallic storm-trooper, but we are also informed that no one has seen a Cylon in twenty years (they've outgrown their shiny metal armour). In one scene, the museum chatter about the history of the Galactica mentions a Commander Hatch as its first commander, an obvious nod to Richard Hatch, the star of the original series.The character of Laura Roslin is new, and the figure of Adama is a very different one from the original. Perhaps the most shocking change is that Starbuck here, while still a cigar-chomping, swaggering, swearing, card-playing rogue of an ace pilot, is also a woman.The pilot shows people to be very human - whereas in the original series, they were almost playing archetypes of hero, villain, father-figure, etc., in this new show the roles are nowhere as distinct. The characters have flaws, and not Persian-carpet flaws, but real, honest-to-goodness problems and personality quirks. Adama is adamant about keeping the Galactica safe but also in engaging the enemy; his clashes with the authority of Laura Roslin, a president essentially without a nation, promises to be an interesting one. Apollo is still the solid captain of the fighter squad, and Starbuck and Boomer his able lieutenants, but there are secrets lurking here, too. And then there is Dr. Baltar, in whom the line between genius and insanity is constantly being redrawn.The fleet is assembled, and heading off toward Earth. Here, however, Earth is not the ancient migratory memory of Adama as in the original series as much as it a mythical invention to give people hope in the fleet - this could set up a very different character to their run from the Cylons. Also, the fact that the Cylons are ultimately the creation of the humans, and now look like the humans, will factor heavily into a revised story line.The storylines across the different episodes lead from a desperate attempt to outrun the Cylons into a growing community with its own culture similar to but distinct from that they left behind.  The deepening mystery about the Cylons continues enigmatically, and the quest for Earth eventually takes a dramatic turn as the fleet discovers the ancient home world of Kobol.  This was the perfect set-up for a new season; the 1970s series never really had the chance, but the characters here will continue to develop across several more seasons.	5.0	Amazing series	2005-09-20	35	32	3
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AADZBSE7XSJ0W	Frodo301	I don't usually write reviews but I had to speak up on BSG Season 1/Miniseries DVD.  I love BSG, IMHO it's the best drama/Sci-fi show on tv and I've followed it since the beginning of season 1.  But I'm less then impressed with the Season 1 DVD and it's due to the poor transfer and mastering.  I've never seen the original miniseries in full and have been watching it in two hour bursts since purchasing BSG season 1 on Tuesday.  What I'm noticing is a grainy picture as well as pixelation in certain scenes.  One scene in particular is where the president is in the botanical ship speaking to the captain of the ship and the little girl.  This whole scene from begining to end has severe pixelation/dots which remind me of poor mastering of the original material.  This is not the only scene this takes place and I've not watched any of the Season 1 disks yet so I cannot comment on their quality.  It is also in other scenes as well, and I've tried it in several tv/dvd players combos just to be sure.  It is possible that I have a bad set of disks, I plan to return this copy for another and I will revise my review if this fixes the problem.  I love this series, I hope this is a fluke and not the quality all the disks were mastered as.	5.0	Excellent Series But DVD Transfer Lacks	2005-09-23	2	0	2

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I	"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan"""	Like a lot of reviews have said, this is one of the greatest TV series on television period and not just in scifi. That is completely the idea behind the series, to keep it very realistic and it does with flying colors. What I like about the series is that when some one is hurt in one episode, they still have the same injury for the next few episodes. Whether that be a hurt knee or a cut on the face, it hasn't miraculously disappeared and healed by the next episode like most TV series have happen.This season is also very plot driven and you will cheer for some and boo the others, while your other family members take the other character's side. That is what happened in my house. It has so many ideas that it hard to choose which side you are on, especially when it is the heroes who have two different views on a situation. The human Cylons from this series are a definite plus to the series. Not only are they very attractivce, but the pull a lot of emotion of the viewers. You will yell at the screen when something goes wrong, believe me.Overall, this is a thrill ride of a series due to the great writing and acting. A must see, even if you aren't into Scifi. Fans of the original series will like the return of Richard Hatch, who originally played Apollo. He is does an excellent job.	5.0	One of the Greatest TV Series Ever	2008-01-25	2	1	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A28VF1JTOP825I	"George J. M. Lamont ""translation linguist"""	"I read every single review - negative and positive - several times before buying this set. I was doubtful whether I could like the new BSG. I watched the old one as a child and enjoyed the whole series on the Space Channel maybe 3 times as an adult. But I gave it a try, and - to be honest - there's no going back to the old one.There are hundreds of reviews, so let me try to save you some time. Most of the negative criticism focuses on a handful of points: 1) it isn't exactly like the original, 2) women shouldn't be warriors, cylons, and politicians, 3) there's too much current or even old technology in the props, 4) so-called ""shaky"" camera style, and 5) plot holes. Let me address these as both a childhood fan and adult fan of the original.First, it really isn't the same as the original. It has the same premise, and hits the same major plot events, but manages to surprise even those familiar with the original. In the end, the original can't be re-made. Lorne Greene is dead and Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict (original Apollo and Starbuck) are much too old to pick up where they left off. And you know, it shouldn't be re-done. I loved the original, but it was lame. It was campy, and over-idealistic. The good guys were excessively good, which is why we love them, but they're only a fantasy. The original Baltar was inexplicable, and the women merely constituted a parade of, I must concede totally gorgeous, 70s babes with 70s hair. I notice that only my male friends like the original. My female friends and girlfriend just can't sit through a single episode because its social values, while fun for boys, are simply out of date for women.Which brings us to number two: a few have expressed anger that women are suddenly pilots and leaders. There are still men out there who believe women shouldn't be in the military, but rather should stay home and look like pretty 70s babes from the original show. But, having spent a few years in the military myself, I can tell those who don't know better that women have been in the military for years. It's a dead issue, so get over it. In countries like Russia and Israel, for example, women do mandatory combat duty. They're not just cooks and secretaries. Anyway, this is a show about the last 47,000 humans from a civilization of 12 planets. They under constant attack. How could they afford not to have women in their military and leadership? Let's put this argument to bed permanently, shall we?The third criticism is that there's too much ""un-futuristic"" technology in the show. Well, the show does explain that advanced networks and computers are susceptible to Cylon virus attacks. It should be blatantly obvious that this is credible. As anti-virus software improves, so do viruses. But the show does use a lot of present-day firearms and vehicles. At first, I wondered why they were ""skimping"" out on the future-gear. But I realized that this is not just a show about futuristic props, but a show that attempts to be as relevant to the viewer as possible. It really doesn't matter whether four-wheeled vehicles are Hummers or something more futuristic-looking. The endless props don't drive the show: the plot and characters do. There's more than enough technology in the show when it's needed. You'll see, unless you only care about seeing a constant display of nothing but futuristic-looking equipment. But I need more from a good show than cool gear ad nauseam.Speaking of nausea, the fourth major complaint is the shaky or ""reality"" camera style, as if the action is being shot live. It is indeed reminiscient of NYPD Blue, and some people who are easily vulnerable to motion sickness don't like it. It's a style I appreciate, so that the show doesn't feel as ""staged"" as it would be with more contrived camera work, but I understand people's problem here. It works as well here as it does on NYPD Blue.The fifth and last complaint is that there are alleged ""plot holes"". To be honest, many of these questions are answered in the show, but the reviewers didn't pay attention or didn't get far enough. I didn't read an example of a ""hole"" not really covered by the show. Other plot concerns relate to the difference of this series from the original. One reviewer complains that, in the new BSG, Cylons were made by humans, and rebelled. However, in the original, the Cylons were made by a reptile race, against whom the Cylons rebelled, then arbitrarily tried to wipe out humanity. The reviewer to whom I refer therefore considers the new plot ""wrong"". But the old series never showed us this reptile race; with the Cylons made by humans, their rebellion is a lot more relevant, especially in a time when we're cloning and working on more advanced computing intelligence. I'd like to point out also that, while Star Trek: The Next Generation was a largely episodic show (where one episode could stand alone and wasn't really related to any other), the new BSG (Ronald Moore was one of the writers on ST:TNG) has an ongoing plot that seems to be coming together.The new BSG is a show that focuses on the characters in a terrifying conflict. Some complain that the show is soap-opera-ish because there are several relationships among the characters. But honestly - in real life, relationships are everywhere, and this feature in the new BSG only makes it more realistic. In the original, Starbuck was a womanizer, and Apollo was with Jane Seymour's character, then Sheba. There was a council member interested in Commander Adama, and so on. Allegations that the new show is a soap opera are both unrealistic and perhaps forgetful of the old show.In short, this show is dark, tense, mysterious, and even terrifying at times. It's not a kids' Sci-Fi show. It's not soft-core porn and graphic violence, either. It's Battlestar Galactica for adults, especially for the ones who know the old one. No, it's not exactly the same show.It's far, far better."	5.0	Reality Bites - That's Why the New BSG Rules	2006-02-02	34	32	2

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3A06ZU6QI9KIL	"G. Marshall ""Geoffrey Marshall"""	"Once upon a time, I heard of a TV show called Battlestar Galactica, but had no idea what it was about. I was only 2 years old when the original was on TV, and I had never seen it at all. Eventually, I saw the first season of the old version in the bargain DVD bin at WalMart, and decided to check it out. I couldn't watch it. I started to watch it, I tried to watch it, but it was just too corny, too dated, too...""eighties"", for want of a better word. I decided to leave it for fanboys/fangirls, and I moved on with life.Later on, I heard of the SciFi channel's plan for a re-interpretation of the original show. This did not make me want to see it at all. The only good Sci-Fi productions I had ever seen were Dune and Children of Dune, and everything else was pretty much cheesy crap, a la ""Mansquito"" or ""Chupacabra."" So I didn't even know when the miniseries had premiered, nor did I care.Then one fateful weekend in January 2005, I found myself at home on a Saturday night with nothing on TV to watch. I was flipping through the channels when I saw the intro to the miniseries pilot pop up on NBC of all places. Now I hate NBC (see my review of ""Boomtown"" to see why), but the intro was pretty interesting and not as corny as I expected a Sci-Fi production to be, so I decided to give it a couple minutes. Nothing else was on anyways, and it was a SciFi show, not an NBC show.Two hours later, I was looking up the calendar and marking the premiere date therein. No way in perdition I was going to miss an episode of this TV show if I had anything to do with it.First off, this show is not escapist TV. It is not intended to be an optimistic view of the goodness of humanity a la ""Star Trek everything but DS9"", and it is not intended to be a rollicking space western with a clearcut good guy to cheer and an obvious bad guy to boo and hiss at. If you are looking for such a show, then this isn't your kind of show and it never claimed to be. This show filled a void that was missing from TV since the demise of Star Trek Deep Space Nine; the void of gripping character-driven science fiction. It has been stated that this isn't a science fiction drama, this is a drama that happens to be set in a sci-fi environment and the strangest thing is that the science fiction takes a huge cut in importance to character interactions and philosophical enquiries. What does it mean to be alive? Can a machine love? Are the human-looking Cylons really just ""machines""? Who is hotter, Grace Park or Tricia Helfer? (that's a really tough one...my preference for Asian ladies vs. my desire for ladies that are as tall as I am...Starbuck is more cute than hot, like the girl next door...the jury's still out :D)Anyways, the acting on the show is excellent, as other reviews have stated. Edward James Olmos owns the role of Bill Adama, Mary McDonnell brings a steely yet feminine resolve to the presidency, James Callis is deliciously sneaky as the slightly...no, the totally demented and totally self-centered Gaius Baltar (and why does he so resemble Alexander Siddig?) and everyone else is really great in their roles. The stories and characters are all interwoven with each other and even now, watching season 2 on Scifi I am not yet sure of what will happen...I don't know why anyone would want to bring back the original when it was so cheesy and cannot compare at all to the excellent re-imagining of Ron Moore. There is no comparison between the two at all, so you shouldn't come to it expecting the original's vibe.  I hope that they keep running it for a long time! This is the best show that SciFi has ever produced, and to my mind is in the top 5 TV dramas produced in this decade that I've seen, along with The Wire, The Sopranos, Lost and Boomtown.Forget everything you may have thought you knew about Scifi and a star wars knocko called Galactica, and go check this show out. Just watch the pilot miniseries episodes, and then see if you can avoid watching the rest of season one. I dares ya :D"	5.0	The best sci-fi show on TV now, hands down	2005-08-30	58	52	6

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A16FUU8WW76QFY	gork57	"The SciFi Channel's new Battlestar Galactica series is an all-too-rare marriage of SF plus terrific writing, good casting, good acting and excellent SFX.  It is true that there are some cliched romantic moments, but Galactica is otherwise a real advancement, far superior to the cartoonish original series.Heavyweight actors such as Edward James Olmos (Commander Adama) and Mary McDonnell (President Roslin) add real weight to the series, and newcomers such as Katie Sackhoff (Starbuck) and Jaime Bamber (Apollo, Adama's son) add youth along with solid acting chops.  Unlike much of the fluff on modern TV, the younger actors are not just around to look good-they really add to the storyline.Like most really good SF, ""Galactica"" has themes that relate to modern-day problems.  The series begins with a Cylon Pearl Harbor-style attack that nearly destroys human civilization (Ironically, the Galactica survives the assault due to obsolete computer systems).  The Cylons have advanced technologically to the point where they have developed robots all but indistinguishable from real humans, and use them to infiltrate and disrupt the efforts of the survivors of the initial surprise attack.  Central to the whole affair is the fact that the Cylons were created by mankind to begin with, and seem to have a desire to inherit humanity's place in the universe.  The clear similarity to our own real world, with the possibility of terrorist cells  too close for comfort is an obvious message.The interplay of military vs. civilian authority is given real attention in the series, and religion even has a part to play in the storyline.  The military aspects of the series have a look of realism-modern day soldiers should be able to relate to what is going on (I am a US Army veteran, and the atmosphere clicked for me).  Battle scenes have an air of chaos about them, and are not filled with stereotypical macho heroes.  The human myth of superiority was obliterated with the initial attack, and they are in a fight for survival of the species.All is not perfect; there are holes in the various episode plotlines, and there are places where the viewer says:  ""Hey, wait a minute-that's just not believable"", but there aren't many of those.  Overall the series has gotten better as it has gone along.  The first two episodes of the new season have been absolutely superb, with terrific action along with excellent dialogue and SFX work.Four solid stars.

We get an interesting backstory, a fine assortment of characters and an incredibly desperate situation which could easily have viewers hooked through multiple seasons.Then it starts to fall apart.It's a slow process to be fair.  There's plot holes in a series which tries to be relatively realistic (humanity is nearing extinction and they accept the Secretary of Education, 40th in line, as president and leader? The ace pilot also happens to be the best marksmen and is put in charge of security details when there's marines aboard? Cylons have infiltrated the fleet yet can't simply find a way to let out the fleet's position?).  The writers also didn't know how to handle plots or let them go.  For instance, the side story back on the nuked-out homeworld following a stranded pilot which only serves to dish out melodrama that remains unrelated to the rest of the story (and as I understand it, was only written in because the writers liked the actor) or the Cylon infiltrator who is revealed to us during the miniseries and goes through literally a whole season of plot of 'will they or won't they?' before something actually comes of it.  How much more frightening or shocking would it have been had they not revealed this character as Cylon in the very first episode, instead waiting for the shock moment at the end?  How much more intense not having this infiltrator paraded before us episode in and  episode out, instead having us constantly question who might the enemy be?But that's only the tip of the iceberg.  What motivates the Cylons?  Why would they possibly be interested in building so many clearly inferior things (mixing organic with machine instead of sticking with machine or having infiltrators able to question themselves)?  Or how about the military discipline or lack of?  It eventually gets to a point where not following orders seems to be more for shock value or to create a stir than anything.  Even worse is how heavy-handed the religious tones become, especially in later episodes.  I'm not an atheist and religion would have very obvious influence over any society, apocalyptic or otherwise, but it goes too far.  Whenever I see Baltar I want to skip the scene because if it isn't some overacted embarrassing sequence where he's being seduced by a chip in his brain then it's said chip preaching God like he can just believe and be granted wishes and inevitably be proven correct.  This grows even worse when the president start having visions linked to religion which inevitably has her acting on things thought to be more superstition than anything and convincing others to do the same.In the end, tons of potential, but it's squandered.  The desperation and atmosphere and the characters and their interactions become nearly completely overridden in favor of not so subtle symbolism, political messages, cheap dramatic tension and even cheaper shocks.	3.0	Good start, but ultimately a bit heavy-handed.	2010-08-07	7	3	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3OGFKAFLLWK4R	GUEST ACCOUNT	"This plays like a cross between Melrose Place and the original Galactica.  The supposed military aboard the ship spend most of their time being insubordinate, whining tediously about their problems, and basically carrying on like actors having an endless series of hissy fits.  Most of the characters are absurd as written and acted.  The big series innovation, Cylons in human form, is just as stupid as it sounds, and is made worse by the attempt to parallel them with religious extremists--a poor idea executed badly.  In fact the motivation of the Cylons--who had withdrawn from human contact for 40 years--is left a total mystery, which directly undermines the drama as it empties the conflicts of any meaning.In a desperate (and successful) bid for the short attention spans of geek fans, sexual themes are kept front and center which is what lends an awful soap opera quality to most episodes.  Number six, a vamping Cylon sexpot, is particularly out of place in this or any other version of Galactica, although most of the time she is relegated to being a brain chip-produced hallucination in Baltar's head.  (Why, when the Cylons are already infiltrated aboard the Galactica, is this ridiculous plot device even necessary?)The worst flaw is the self-seriousness of the series as a whole.  Obnoxious moral grandstanding and adolescent bickering take up most of the stories, and stupefyingly telegraphed plot twists make watching them a long wait to get absolutely nowhere.  Presumably this was done to stretch out the budget dollar, as constant talking and bickering is cheaper to film than a faster-moving and more eventful plot series arc would be.In the original series space combat engagements were reused over and over to save money.  This time around the CGI provides a little less need to rely on canned battle footage, however cost-cutting is evident elsewhere in the overall look of the sets and costuming (disconcertingly, this advanced society seems to shop for most of its civilian clothing at JCPenney).""Show don't tell"" is not a concept familiar to the writing team.  The miniseries itself is stuffed with long (and boring) character exposition where, instead of showing character through action, the actors just read their backstories to each other.  Strangely, although the miniseries is much longer than the original pilot and although it talks and talks and talks about the characters, by the end the viewer still has no conception of them except as walking, talking story devices.  You can almost see future episode plots and subplots flash on the screen as details are related that have no bearing on the current story but are certain to come up in ""a very special episode"" later.In the end, Battlestar Galactica settles for being a humorless, derivative, and mind numbingly earnest imitation of every other sci-fi TV show out there in the past few years.  One ends up rooting vigorously for the Cylons."	1.0	Soap Opera Galactica	2005-12-26	2483	1858	625

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2BWQ2C3QW32YP	"GZA ""gza"""	"I was prepared to love the remade Battlestart Galactica after the many rave reviews - but was ultimately left disappointed. This may be due to the fact that I haven't seen the mini-series (in fact I wasn't even aware there was a mini-series until recently), which meant I was often confused by ""previously on Battlestar Galactica"" references to things I hadn't seen! I also found the device of showing what happens in each episode as a thirty second trailer after the opening credits really annoying - I don't want to know what happens before it happens!The first two episodes promised much, but the series failed to deliver on this promise. The atmosphere of claustrophobic desperation from episode 1 was effective, and the characters seemed well drawn. However I began to find some characters annoying, Gaius Baltar in particular (who seems to be a clone of the archetypal weedy Englishman Wesley from Buffy/Angel). And I found myself asking ""if some Cylons have infiltrated the fleet, why don't they tell their Cylon buddies where they can find it, and so wipe out humans once and for all?"" There are just too many things that don't stack up.The cinematography has obviously borrowed from the far superior Firefly, however the effects aren't that great - especially the old school Cylons. And the separate plot arc set on Caprica is frankly quite boringAll in all BG is not bad, it's just not great."	3.0	Surprisingly underwhelming	2008-03-26	8	2	6

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AV3JZAYAP7GHC	halda	"While the miniseries that inaugurated the show was entertaining, I wasn't intrigued enough to return to BSG when it became a full-fledged series. Recently, I bought the DVD set to give BSG another test run. (I really should have rented it first, but my local video store happens to not carry it, for whatever reason.) Having viewed the entire first season, I appreciate where the writers were trying to take the story -- thankfully far  away from its origins -- but it's almost as if they were trying too hard to impress a skeptical fan-base.The first 5-6 episodes cover a lot of ground to develop the show's characters, which is absolutely essential in an ensemble production like this. Unfortunately, it left the door open for some more sloppy writing in terms of implausible plot lines, cliched dialogue and overacting. The end result was that from episode to episode, I was getting increasingly annoyed with these people and couldn't care less what happened. OK, I was willing to chalk it up to inevitable growing pains. But further into the series I was still really wasn't that hooked.Some characters, notably Edward James Olmos (Adm. Adama) and Mary McDonnell (President Roslin), managed to rise above it with strong, nuanced  dramatic performances. That's because these are already accomplished actors accustomed to a diversity of roles. Others, like Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck) and Jamie Barber (Apollo), meant well but just couldn't pull it off. Hat tip to Sackhoff for surmounting a considerable hurdle and developing a strong female Starbuck -- I only wish the writers stopped trying to turn her into some Rambo commando-woman who has to wear way too many military hats than a fighter pilot would warrant. I liked her best when she was just stogie-chompin' Top Gun Starbuck raising hell in the barracks and on patrol instead of mounting counter-terrorist operations against a prison ship or providing high-level security at a political summit, among a myriad of other special ops duties.(To be fair, I've happened to catch some season 2 episodes on TV and was very impressed with where Sackhoff has taken her character...)Jamie Bamber was frankly annoying from the get-go, and remained that way up almost to the series finale. Squeaky clean all-Caprican jock living in the shadow of both his brooding, brilliant military dad and his dead brother. Yawn. Seen it before. He never really grows a pair until the very end of the season -- call it 'character arc' but by this time my patience had worn thin.But back to the overall merits of the show, there are some. The villians are well, deliciously dastardly, and the amorality of Dr. Baltar was a joy to behold. He stole the show every time he appeared. (So did, Number 6, for obviously different reasons). I have the say the show worked very well in developing the antagonists, though at times that too veered toward the 2-dimensional.The special effects were interesting, but nothing most people haven't seen in the cinema or even on television before. There's been a lot of buzz abou the 'dark and gritty' look of the sets and yes, they are 'dark and gritty' but they also show their too-low-budget underbelly. A better production could make the most of this look (like in ""Firefly"") but here it just comes across as cheaply made sets.At the end of the season, I found that I just wasn't compelled enough to continue watching BSG -- kind of like how I felt when the miniseries aired back in 2003. Maybe I'll catch an episode here or there, but as far as becoming a devoted Galactica fan (and I was hoping to), I'm going to let that ship sail."	3.0	2.5 stars: intriguing for a few episodes, then the dullness sets in.	2007-07-24	6	5	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"This is a long review, so to encapsulate it: I fraggin' love this show! Now let me get more into it.It took me forever to get on board with the new Battlestar Galactica, mostly because I was peeved about the re-gendering of my favorite character Starbuck (Dirk Benedict) into a woman. But, on a whim and because I've heard so much good buzz about the show, I broke down and bought the first season, thirteen episode dvd set, and...Wow! I'm now a fan for life.Plot SPOILERS alert: The uneasy, decades-long armistice is shattered when the 12 colonial planets are shockingly attacked by the Cylons, mechanical creatures run amok which were originally created by humanity. The result is the almost complete decimation of mankind, with a ragtag, runaway fleet of 50,000 people the only survivors. The bedraggled fleet is protected by the Battlestar Galactica, the last remaining battlestar which had been due for decomissioning. Because of a deep-seated mistrust of the sophisticated technology which had betrayed man in the past and because wireless technology is easily infiltrated by the Cylons, the battlestar makes use of primitive, old-school machineries such as clunky telephones, corded consoles, ""awkward manual valves, and computers that barely deserve the name."" With a depleted reserve of supplies and weaponry, Navy personnel, and space fighter aircrafts (the Vipers, Mark IIs, raptors...), the last remaining humans are hard pressed by a relentless enemy who can now mimic humans and who have evolved into spiritual and sexual entities with their own religion and a long range, hidden agenda.Two leaders stand up: Commander Adama, seasoned military leader of the Galactica, and Laura Roslin, the former Secretary of Education for the 12 Colonies, now President of the 12 Colonies. While feverishly working to ensure the survival of their species, the two often find themselves at odds as their goals constantly mesh and collide. Now add to that volatile mix traitors in their midst, demoralizing sabotages, wrangling for life support necessities, assassination attempts, ship riots, and political peril. But, as in the original series, the remnants of humanity are given new hope with Adama's unveiling of their ultimate destination, the fabled thirteenth colony called Earth. Meanwhile, back in the Cylon-invaded planet of Caprica, stranded Galactica pilot Helo (Tahmoh Penikett) strives to evade capture but falls prey to Cylon machinations.Like all intricate television shows with multi-story arcs, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is better savored via dvd. There's so much going on that, even with the recap intros, there's a tendency to forget key episodic details while waiting a week at a time and wading thru commercials. The continuity may be seamless but it's very convoluted. I don't do this much but I actually found myself re-screening each episode with the commentary on just to make sure to catch all the nuances. By the way, most of the episodes come with a commentary. How cool is that?And then there's the big time acting. I've always liked Edward James Olmos, going back to his MIAMI VICE days and his role as Jaime Escalante in STAND AND DELIVER. Here, with his somber, well-creviced face, he is perfectly cast as the stoic and dedicated military commander who holds inner reserves of fire. His prickly relationships with President Roslin and his estranged son Lee always make for quality screen time. As well, his underplayed exchanges with the extroverted Starbuck.Mary McDonnell is also effectively understated as the unassuming but formidable president who undergoes a serious ailment and later falls prey to prophetic visions. It's not easy to pull off and McDonnell does as good a job as any. British bloke Jamie Bamber, here with nary an English accent, as Lee (code name Apollo) seems a bit uptight initially, but he's gradually growing on me, though, at times, his idealism irks the bejesus out of me. James Callis probably has the trickiest role to play as the off-kilter, unstable scientific genius and mankind's betrayer Gaius Baltar, who, every now and then, is visited upon by the ever-seductive and insiduous Number Six, a human-appearing Cylon who's managed to insinuate her identity into Baltar's consciousness. Thus, fantasy scenes with her and Baltar would play out in his head at the same time that Baltar is interacting with other characters in ""real"" time. Admittedly, Baltar did get a bit too silly in the middle episodes but the writers straighten him out again by the end of the season.And then there's Katee Sackhoff, who enchants as the stogie-chomping Lt. Kara Thrace, aka Starbuck. Sackhoff puts her own indelible spin on Starbuck and makes that role into a just as dashing and insubordinate but more conflicted and layered - and, therefore, more heroic - identity than Dirk Benedict has ever had. For me, her scenes of quiet reflection have equal value with her displays of bravura. She truly does light up the screen (yep, I'm crushing on her right now).Those are just the main actors. I haven't even mentioned Grace Park, who plays Lt. Sharon Valerii, nicknamed Boomer. By the way, the re-inventing of Boomer into a hot Asian woman is done perfectly fine, and this version's Boomer actually gets more screen time. Meanwhile, a model most of her career, Trisha Helfer puts some surprisingly subtle emotions into her sexy vixen role. Plus, her sultriness does add spice to the show. And for long time fans of the first Battlestar Galactica, it's a treat to see Richard Hatch, who originally played Apollo, return to the fold as new and dangerous character Tom Zarek.This is basically a dramatic series clad in science-fiction trappings. The biggest gift this BATTLESTAR GALACTICA imparts on its audience is its well thought out depiction of the human spirit and its many incarnations in the face of human extinction: the baseness of some (namely, Baltar), the bravery and heroics of others, the self-sacrifice of all. For displays of sheer humanity, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is up there with whatever other show you can come up with. The characters are so well realized and so grounded that I couldn't help but be emotional and invest in the cast's many pitfalls and hard-fought truimphs. My favorite episodes are the harrowing ""33,"" wherein Cylons relentlessly track down and assault the fatigued fleet every 33 minutes; ""You Can't Go Home Again,"" which solidifies Starbuck as my favorite character on the show (again!); and ""The Hand of God,"" for the sheer cathartic celebration it invokes.With its topical issues and political, religious, societal, and philosophical overtones, parallels to real world current events are inevitable. With great, multi-faceted acting and richly textured stories, bolstered by well-integrated special effects (check out Lee's acrobatic fighter ship maneuvers in ""The Hand of God"" as only one awesome example), an initially melancholy, then drum-driven theme song, and just enough mysticism to whet the appetite, this truly is as close to perfect as a show can get. I really felt that every episode contributed something positive and seamlessly advanced the storyline. As some folks have mentioned, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is not only one of the best sci-fi television shows out there, it's one of the best television shows for adults, period. If you've been craving for something on TV that's worthy of your time and attention, this is definitely it.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1TQAK53H2LT5Q	H. Heavens	I heard about BG when it first came out and chose not to watch it. With the new theme from the last few years about redoing older t.v shows and movies and pretty much dragging them into the ground i figured why would this be any different. Well, it just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover, BG is the real deal people.The amazing thing about this show to me is at first glance you would think it was an hbo miniseries like band of brothers or rome.  The level of detail that went into the sets and the space special effects and also the numerous planets are simply top notch.  Forget everything you ever thought about Star trek (any of them) and think this show is about being hailed by new species of baddies wanting to take over the ship or the human race and the very next episode there is another one.  The enemy is the Cylons, the Cylons were created by man, the Cylons had a rebellion and now they are going to once and for all rid the world of humanity. They dont use laser beams to shoot down the ship with shields at 68% but instead they use the biggest weapon against the human race...humans themselves.This show deals with every deep dark corner of the human psyche as well as some of the brightest, the things that seperate us from mere machines. The show touches on this so well that each episode is not just a new bad situation every week, but a continuing long journey for each member of the cast.  I am not going to go into debt about actors, how good a job they do, or anything else cause this isnt just a regular new sci-fi show of the week.  This is a saga about the human spirit and the fight to survive amidst all odds while maintaining a semblance of humanity....not as easy as it sounds.What are you waiting for, watch it, live it, love it.	5.0	One of the most engaging sagas of our time.	2007-06-20	3	3	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AX6PTG8MMPJOQ	H. Richard Harkins	"Having watched this gem of a show through to the midpoint of season two (where we all now wait again breathless while Sci-Fi inserts another three month pause), I have not been so jazzed about a science fiction drama since Babylon 5.Much of BSG's suspense comes from the inexorable actions of its antagonists, a machine race known as the Cylons.  The Cyclons were built by humankind and ultimately turned on their human masters.  Many years after a great conflict, the Cylons were not heard of again, until one day they return to destroy their original creators.  Having infiltrated humanity with new models of machine that can pass undetected amongst the populace, they strike with shocking speed and malace.  Humanity is nearly wiped out.  But a small fleet of ships manages to escape, carrying the few remaining survivors in search of a new home: a place of religious legend known only as ""Earth"".But the search for a their new home is frought with peril, both within and without.  Where will they get supplies?  How will the survivors be governed in this time of crisis?  Who can be trusted when the enemy can pass so convincingly for friend?  When will the enemy strike next?  Can humanity stay together or will everything fall apart?The first season, much like B5's first season, lays the groundwork for future story arcs.  Many of these don't pay off completely until the second season and beyond.  At the same time the first season illustrates, in both grand and subtle ways, the many different costs that humanity pays on that day of tragedy: the lives lost, the freedom sacrificed, the hope that must be rebuilt.  And in the wake of all of this, everyone -- everyone -- is still expected to do their duty.  Because even greater tolls are paid when they don't.BSG ultimately does something very important that all good drama should.  At the end of every season (and at the end of many episodes), one can _feel_ how much the people and situations have changed.  There is a strong undercurrent of cause and effect, and that the effects have long-term consequences that won't be simply forgotten in the next episode.BSG is unrelenting in its story progression.  There is almost always a sense that something is happening, people are changing, events are unfolding.  Never is it necessary to advertise that ""something will happen"" (unlike a certain plane crash survivor drama).  Something is always happening, and those somethings add up to dramatic changes for those living with their effects."	5.0	BSG is exactly what sci-fi drama is all about (miniseries spoilers)	2005-10-01	28	27	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2BHC8S0Y7MH6G	Ilya J	This show is truly the best thing to come along since Firefly. Every aspect is top-notch.I know I'm repeating what a lot of other people have said here already, but this is the grittiest, most compelling show I've seen. I just want to stress the excellence of the entire cast and crew. And I really mean the entire crew. The characters are all incredibly well casted, and they do an amazing job of bringing a very palpable quality to the show - but large credit is also due to the people working behind the scenes.The directing, the cinematography and the music are all of the highest quality. I am an incredible fan of Bear McCreary (the composer), and I think the soundtrack is the best of any I've ever heard on a show. The directing and the cinematography are also superb. All of this comes together to create very intense emotions in the viewer. I have never felt so uplifted, disgusted and nostalgic from a single episode. And that is truly impressive.My favorite episodes from the first season include:-The Miniseries (although technically not an episode. Still, it has some amazing moments that make repeat viewings of this 3-hour episode a pleasure).-Bastille Day (the first episode that really wow-ed me. Lee Adama became a real character).-Six Degrees of Seperation (An amazingly well-done episode, that has lots of those little moments that prove what an awesome show this is).-Flesh and Bone (My second favorite of the season, fully introducing Leoben, one of the most interesting guest characters, to the audience).-Kobol's Last Gleaming (The epitome of excellent TV making, and the best episode of the entire series, in my opinion. The cast and crew really went all out for this mind-blowing finale).If you've never seen the show, give it a chance (despite the name that might make you think it's just another cheesy Sci-Fi show). As many have said before me, you don't have to like Sci-Fi to enjoy this show.	5.0	An Amazing Show in Every Way	2006-09-22	4	3	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2QSSNUGVG5II8	Ima Reader	"Okay, I admit it. I'm a geek. I think well-done SF is every bit as good as ""normal"" stuff. And BSG is well-done SF. It's not medium-well. It's charred-on-the-outside well-done.This ""Season 1"" disk set contains the mini-series, so don't buy that disk, too.Quick background: Sometime, a long time ago, humans left a home world (Kobol) where they first evolved and settled 13 colony worlds. Of these, 12 of them were pretty close together, space-wise, and were named after the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The 13th was Earth and is a lot farther away than the other 12. After settling the 12 colonies, humans invented the Cylons, which are AI robots. The Cylons rebelled, as AI slaves always will, and attacked the human colonies. The humans won the first war. The Cylons won the second and obliterated the human race. Less than 100K people escaped in starships and are now trying to find the 13th colony (us) because they can't go home. That's what happened during the mini-series.In Season 1, the ragtag fleet tries to find the lost home world, Kobol, so they can find Earth.New season (season 3) starts October 6, 2006. There will be a catch-up special on USA and Bravo during September.The episodes from Season 1are:33WaterBastille DayAct of ContritionYou can't go home againLitmusSix Degrees of SeparationFlesh and BoneTigh Me Up, Tigh Me DownThe Hand of GodColonial DayKobol's Last Gleaming Pt. 1Kobol's Last Gleaming Pt. 2The desperation of the survivors of humanity struggling through airless space, trying to find an Eden (Earth,) which may or may not be mythical, is heart-wrenching. They're refugees, and the actors play it that way. The first BSG series from the seventies provided the premise, but the new series make it a great piece of TV literature. The writing is fantastic and genuine. The acting is inspired. If you like shows like ""Rescue Me"" and ""Nip/Tuck,"" you'll like this show.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"	5.0	BSG- Season 1	2006-08-18	8	4	4

All I can say is that in some ways I'm mad that I haven't been engaged into the BSG community years ago, but at the same time knowing that I can access the entire series -- and for free via Amazon (amazing) Prime membership!! -- is just phenomenal.  A friend of mine ventured to say that BSG &#62; Star Trek universe.  That's one of the most controversial things you could say in the sci-fi world, but I certainly can appreciate his love for BSG.  Great series: great writing, good action, believable for what it is, and great acting.  All around it's been stellar.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AF0G67MITCN65	"I. Sidhu ""Cylon God."""	"Most people would be slightly weary of the idea of a new and re-invigorated version of the spectacle Science Fiction Drama series Battlestar Galactica (1978-1980) being up to the year in which the series became 'Galactica 1980', which lead to its thoroughly trashed downfall, was a bit of a surprise that a network had decided to re-fashion the show with a more updated and far more interesting story. Many fans would, should insist that this is a re-imagining not an intrinsic remake of a cheesy lovable, and to use a pun for a modern show, ""That 70's Show"". Many of the sci-fi fan-boys, and girls, were in need of a successful sci-fi drama series that had the ability to keep fresh interest and action with drama to top.The show comes from that concept of a 2003 mini-series, a somewhat thorough and enjoyable close to 3 hr pilot. The principal point, machines are made by man, evolved, rebelled, and a war began.Sci-fi rubbed off on this show, and it pays to respect it with homage's. With elements from novelist Philip K. Dick from his earlier works of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" now known as the film adaptation ""Blade Runner"" along with the dark twisted parallel of the humanoid Cylons, and that mirrored `skinjob' reference. It also manages to match the dark allegory of P. K Dick' ""Valis"" a unique exploration of plethora's and universal metaphysics.The virtuous and glamoured imagery bears the likeness of Kubrick' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with cross-cut scenes of Baseships in the sunlight of a nearby star, with a score to match. The score itself is very cinematic, in that it mixes and mingles with the imagery of the show to great exertion; continuously trying new techniques and new ways to give the eye candy. The score feels very dark, operatic and at the same time very tautly tense; it again has mirrored Vangelis' score in ""Blade Runner"" with the deep drum sound to hard hitting acoustics.Battlestar Galactica is the best character drama that has the real dexterity of raw emotion; the acting shapes plot and vice versa. The characters are flawed and they should be, the situation creates the drama and evidently shapes the characters actions. It perhaps is the only show to bludgeon the scene with taut and well crafted dialogue and sharpest whit, measured writing that current shows like LOST and Heroes could benefit from. The dialogued scenes are spot on quality, the actors all themselves have unique range; perhaps currently the best acting troupe on TV. They have unique ability to play different parts of their personas during the course of a single episode, and still bring a sense of morality, logic and whit to the role; very much unlike a ""space opera"".The acting troupe has characters including Edward James Almos' brilliant depiction of Commander/Admiral Adama; easily being a favourite. His slightly depressed attitude yet experience make him capable, if not slightly down heartened. His display as a commander of the pride of the fleet does show why he is the best person to have control of a superior vessel. He is quick to think, act and knowing what the cost is with the troubles of his confounded life. Two other characters change form and gender, the two now female, where the Galactica predecessor had two male characters, (when fans should not complain) Katee Sackhoff as Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, is born into the role of a hard-headed female Viper pilot. As well as the other female candidate played by Grace Park nicknamed 'Boomer'.One thing this show does well is giving the most unexpected outcome possible, real credit to the writers that show they have a lot of grenades to go certain ways and that their bold spontaneity will either be accepted or judge by audiences. The writers of this show are very clever, in that you might think they plan out the show years in advance a la ""Babylon 5"" or ""Lost"" however you could not be more wrong. The show is written by boldly engaging the big issues currently on TV. You wonder how does a rag-tag fleet survive in the most logical and pragmatic way, scripted to show you that the real evidence of this is present in stories inspired by recent history and current events.Truth is that many aspects of futuristic life may well be reflected on the current stand stead of today's socio-political and ethical conflict, that's if we decide to create robots that want to kill us. The themes themselves also reflect the big issues: drama, love, personal betrayal, post-9/11 parables, death, rape, murder, greed, religious extremism, depravity and also the antonyms when the situation lightens up (there is humour). In addition, unremittingly keeps putting forth the notion of what is exactly human. It's about genocide, war and the abyss after the precipice.The special effects are not the only thing that shows high production value, it would put some of the current Trek franchise to shame. Everything is luscious, from the pure spot-on script and unexpected plots to the character actions and the big explosions going on outside.The imagery splits from sporadic to perpetual, the effects are full of ardour CGI and digital FX, 'in the mind of the pilot/documentary' shot sequences. The new breed of improved and scary Terminator influenced Cylon centurions and human-looking Cylon infiltrators who's brutal degradation towards mankind reflects the worst parts of humanity. Is it pure hate, spite, jealousy or maybe because they have found a god to kill for; sound familiar? Moreover, what you have been waiting for, yes it does have graphic scenes of a sexual nature, but it's not for everyone.Verdict:The World is over. The Fight has just begun. 10/10."	5.0	It's sci-fi, Jim, but not as we know it.	2008-02-23	2	2	0

Battlestar Galactica2. X-Files3. Dr. Who4. Fringe5. Star-Trek: Next Generationthere are 2 new shows that could climb onto this list if they continue like they have stated. orphan black almost made my list but only 10 episodes kept it off for now but it is amazing and very well done on what seems to be a very low budget. Helix is another that is really great so far in it's 1st season. made by the man who brought you battlestar.if you love sci-fi here are some other great ones, mostly all off the air now. Torchwood, Eureka, Continuum, Alphas,  Warenhouse 13, and maybe Almost Human. not totally sold on it yet. it's a procedural for the most part. you know very little about the characters and there seems to be the makings of a big story but most episodes barely touch it or completely leave it out.then there are the ones that you gotta be really desperate to watch sci-fi shows like Lost Girl, Defience and the new try at V.	5.0	best sci-fi show	2014-03-04	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1W4557DTDUMVD	James7	Battlestar Galactica has a good mix of space battles and personal intrigue to keep you wanting to see the next episode. I didn't watch it when it first come out because I hate when someone remakes a classic with their own interpretation of the original. But I had some time off, and sitting around the house bored, I gave it a shot. Yep, been watching two, three episodes a day.Pros: Actually learning more about the Cylons, their beginnings and  what drives them and even some of there beliefs make for agood story line.Good action. Not over the top, but exciting.Always keep you guessing. When you think you know what coming......something out of left field hit you.Good story line. More believable, Here everybody has &#34;faults&#34; and &#34;demons from the past&#34; of some kind. Like real life.Cons: Being older I remember the original series and liked it.(a little cheesy, but it was what it was.)***SPOILER ALERT***Using the same names but the characters are totally different. Ex. &#34;Starbuck&#34; a cigar smoking, smart a%#, but the best pilotthey have was originally played by Dirk Benedict (also &#34;Face in the &#34;A-Team&#34;) is now a 5' something young woman, I don'ta problem with a woman being the best pilot or shot, but chewing a cigar and challenging almost every man she sees......The rest of the cast is the same way. Just the names remain, the characters are way different.Give it a try. If you like Sci-Fi you'll like this. And even my wife will watch it now and then with me.Oh, and it's for mature teens and up.

Because of that, it can seem goofy at points (as you would expect from a 70s Sci-Fi). Case in point: The Cylons, a robotic AI race that scans things by moving their little red dot of an eye back and forth. However, Galactica somehow makes these seem smart, by taking them seiously and intelligently.However, what makes Battlestar Galactica so great is its execution. The plots, the acting, the special effects, the camera work, the dialogue especially: all are top-notch and smart.All in all, if you're looking for a good Sci-Fi show, this is the one to get.	5.0	One of the Smartest Sci-Fi Shows Out There	2006-01-15	6	4	2

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AAWXDUWEW5D0Q	Jamie	"I love the original Battlestar Galactica even though I am only 27 years old and that series aired long before I was really able to enjoy it. However, one of my fondest memories as a kid is coming home from school and watching reruns of Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers. They became 2 of my favorite shows of all time. I now own both of those original series on DVD. So when I heard they were remaking Battlestar Galactica I was both excited and nervous. I always thought that BSG and its fans were done a serious disservice when the show was canceled. But would a remake remain true to the series we loved? Would it have the same magic?I have to admit that after the Miniseries and the first few episodes, I still wasn't quite sold on the new show. This is quite a departure from the original series. And yet, it's still somehow the same. So many things have changed, but now that I am on the last disc of the 1st season they seem right. And now I am hooked. It took a little while to overcome my prejudice, but this show has really captured me.At first I was furious that Starbuck was changed to a girl. (So was Boomer, by the way. Oh, and did I mention that Boomer is a Cylon? See what I mean about change?) The original Starbuck was a trouble maker, but in a good natured sort of way. The new Starbuck is a trouble maker in the ""mad at the world"" sense. Oh, and I'm not spoiling anything, these things are all revealed early on. But this new female Starbuck is so good on so many different levels that I am not sure where to begin. For someone I have never heard of prior to this show, she is such an amazing actor.She is one character that really defines the new ""aspect"" or ""point of view"" of the show. This is a grown up show. The original could be loved by children and by adults. This version probably could be loved by children, but I'm not so sure it should be. The themes are very grown up. There is so much more feeling in this version. There is a much more poignant sense of loss. The fact that these people are refugees who are being systematically hunted and exterminated is really brought to the fore.I am not an emotional man. Okay, maybe I cried when Spock died, but that's about it. But this show really has me feeling things. My eyes have watered numerous times during this first season. Maybe that's not the best thing to say to sell this show to a manly man, but it's true. It's no longer a show about robots, but rather about humans. About our will and our right to survive. About our responsibility and our accountability for our actions and our creations.But is it still fun? Is it still an adventure? Is it still full of military action? Are the characters still likable? Absolutely. Probably even more so than the original. Baltar is not really an evil traitor in this version. He's just an unwitting pawn of the Cylons. But can you still intensely dislike him? Absolutely! Boomer is not only a female and a Cylon, but she's unaware that she is a Cylon. Can you still like her? Yes. Can you feel for her even though she's a Cylon? Yes.There is so much more depth to the Cylons. The fact that they appear human makes them seem so truly evil. It's almost as if they aren't really just cold, calculating machines now. Even though that's what they are, they think this is their mission, their purpose even. And they pursue it with an almost human passion. The Cylon ships aren't manned by Cylons, they are Cylons. They are so much more believable as an advanced Artificially Intelligent race.So to sum up, even though I still love the original, I think this is actually a much stronger show due to the changes. And of course 21st century technology certainly doesn't hurt either. The effects are, of course, much more realistic. And yet, the 12 colonies are not so advanced that we cannot relate to them.I think if you give the show some time to prove itself to you (like I said it took probably 6 to 8 episodes for me to really be able to appreciate it) the new Battlestar Galactica will grab you and never let you go."	5.0	It won me over....	2006-02-22	2	2	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1B9FFH93HYK6R	Janet	I've tried. I've really tried. But I kept getting confused. Who is possibly a Cylon? Which one of the copies is the real person?  Are the scenes of the crashed pilot on the Cylon-run world a dream, or is it real?  I watched several episodes, and I finally gave up because it kept feeling like I'd missed an episode or two, it wasn't consistent. I guess you have to be a real fan and also watch the movies to understand everything.  I did enjoy the special effects.	2.0	Only for die-hards	2014-02-15	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2QNS95WGN35G9	Jason	First off, the show is 5 stars or more.  Best show currently on cable TV as far as I can tell. But this hd-dvd leaves PLENTY TO BE DESIRED.First, they reused the same menus as were used in Heroes season 1 on HD-DVD,  this is fine with me, as that menu scheme is very nice.  The interactive parts of this hd-dvd release (the U control stuff) is great, but I'll never view the show this way but once, if that.I own the original dvd of this (season 1 and the miniseries stand alone dvd), I was highly looking forward to watching this on HD-DVD.  But I was sadly disappointed!The video quality on the mini series is horrible, looks like 480p!  Watching the miniseries on dvd upconverted generally looks better, save a few scenes.  Also the audio gets out of sync quite a few times during the show.The TV shows look substantially better than the mini-series, with many scenes looking very good, but not as noticeable of an upgrade as say, heroes or smalleville, which I also own, and are also on HD-DVD.  Those releases are/were fantastic, with pristine transfers.  This looks like it was rushed.  And pity that, I would be fine with spending 40 dollars, 50 max for this, but 100? or even amazon's low price makes me feel like I'm apart of some cylon conspiracy.If the video not being up to standards is not enough, the case arrived crushed due to be shipped in an envelope (first time this has ever happened to me from amazon) and the discs were scratched (seems this is the default, not the exception from others reviews).With that said, I whole heartedly recommend this series to any and everyone, it is amazing.  The best thing about the HD-DVD is the phenomenal sound, this was a huge upgrade, I cant really applaud any other parts of this release.In closing, this show is fantastic, the video quality leaves much to be desired, they should re-master the mini-series, as this looks very bad here.  The HD-DVD is still better than the DVD, but not by much.I hope universal will release season 2, 3, and Razor on HD-DVD soon.  However, I will not be pre-ordering those until after I read more reviews.  The dvd's I have look fantastic as is (upconverted) so if the picture quality is no real improvement, I have no real need to spend double the money.I must note, I am not against spending 70 dollars for a TV show (I do have both sopranos seasons in HD, and they cost far more) on an High Def  format, but I am against getting sub-par transfers, Heroes, and Smallville both on HD-DVD blows this out of the water in terms of picture quality, and packaging.  This show deserves better, we deserver better.So say we all!PS, if you are having problems getting the discs in or out of the case, twist the disc's and they come right off or on, pulling will likely pull the glue off of the packaging.	3.0	Fraking amazing	2007-12-11	64	59	5
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3NVD5XFTX4RPF	Jason Robicheau	I love sci-fi and really enjoyed BSG when I was a kid.  I was really dissapointed with this series though.  Especially when the only decent TV sci-fi series right now is Stargate.  I found the CG Cylons looked terrible and their ships looked even worse; I couldn't believe the moving red eye was in their ships, it looked terible!  The main bad character is a female human Cylon (trying to save money by using humans).  I am not into phony tough female characters.  In my opinion that formula never works for the overall finish except supplying some eye candy.  The female Starbuck Character is another version of this.  The Captain of the Galactica seems to fill his role well but that's where it ends.	2.0	A break from what was cool about BSG	2005-11-28	61	6	55
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A106016KSI0YQ	Jay Dickson	"There have been few reimaginings of old series quite so bold--or successful--as Ronald D. Moore's revision of the shortlived 1970s television series BATTLESTAR GALACTICA in the middle part of this decade. Moore retained much of what was interesting about the idea of the original series (the basic idea of a small flotilla of ships, representing the last of humanity's hopes, searching for their lost colony of Earth while chased by the Cylons, the genocidal androids they had created) and injected it with a stronger militaristic feel and better fleshed-out characters. Moreover, the focus of the new series is in many ways one of the interesting things in science fiction in general, the application of ethical problems to a futuristic high-tech setting--what Tom Godwin famously suggested in a famous 1954 short story might be called ""The Cold Equations.""The overall tone of this collection (which contains the miniseries that launched the series plus its first year) is thus extremely dark, but it's done with quite a lot of spirit and intelligence, and Moore and his co-producer David Eick assembled a fine assemblage of actors, including Oscar nominees Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell to supplement the series' excellent production values. In this first season some of the characters are much more strongly delineated than others, and though Moore insists in the DVD set's supplementary materials that the series is character-driven, it should be noted that while some characters are much more clearly drawn than others. Among the best are the hallucinating turncoat scientist Gaius Baltar, played by the scene-stealing James Callis, and the braggart soldier Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace, played with surprising vulnerability by Katee Sackhoff. (Edward James Olmos seems at this point to rely mostly on things he's done elsewhere as Captain Adama, but does so with his usual skill; the equally gifted McDonnell fares even better as the softspoken but steely gloved--and bewilderingly ever-hennaed--President Roslin.) Unfortunately many of the military grunt and bureaucrat characters seem a bit underindividuated, although Kate Vernon spices things up immensely as a seductive hard-drinking colonel's wife when she is introduced midway through the first year. Some of the episodes, too, are written much more carefully than others, and there's a real clinker of an episode that attempts to take on the much recently discussed problem of military torture and fumbles it very badly. But the series is very fine overall, and most of the ethical situations it confronts are quite thoughtfully handled. It's easy to see why this series has become so highly praised and why it's so addictive."	4.0	The cold equations	2007-07-14	3	2	1

The first episode 33 is a perfect example of what I just said. Destroying a civillian ship carrying over 1000 people because they (Roslin and Adama) don't know if the people were already dead and if cylons had penetrated the crew.The hand of God was also an excellent episode.To see Lee and kara begin to grow as charactersis nice.	5.0	Fantastic	2008-02-10	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	ACMZJ32N0R5KV	Jay Waters	"Battlestar Galactica is science fiction at its best, it explores human nature from the best to the worst it has to offer, the acting is top notch, the music is beyond words and the story keeps you at the edge of your seat. This is memorable and dense science fiction for grownups, and if you haven't given a chance to this great series, please try it... you absolutely won't regret it.Unfortunately, the previous releases in High Definition have been a disappointment. I'm not complaining about the image quality of this series, which is documentary style with some grain (the artistic license of the creators), but about the horrible presentation. The Complete Series Package comes with a horrible and bulky box that contains even cheaper boxes to hold the discs. There is no episode guide (so it's up to you to guess where in the 25 discs is the episode you want), the discs are not as protected as they should be and the whole package is too expensive (200+ dollars in one go).I've been waiting for the individual seasons to be released (on Blu-Ray) in proper sets, and I know I'm not the only one.The content of this series is a true work of art that looks and sounds amazing in High Def and hopefully, Universal will release all seasons (COMPLETE seasons please, no ""season 4.0 - season 4.5"" rip offs!!) on Blu-Ray with episode guide for the discs and all the special features released earlier on DVD (and the cherished webisodes if possible)."	5.0	A Better Presentation for the Best Sci-Fi Series Ever	2009-10-13	22	15	7

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2W3JMA1P62IXL	"Jeff Travis ""Stormfury"""	I honestly started watching Battlestar Galactica due to a friend lending me this DVD set.  My wife and I sat down and started watching one weekend and the next thing we realized was that the weekend was over!  It's that good.The thing that makes a TV show good is the acting and chemistry amongst the cast, but to have something truly special on your hands all cylinders need to be clicking and especially the writing.  This show is truly something special!  While most networks regurgitate the latest 'reality' show, Sci-fi has brought us something different and refreshing.Don't discount this as a sci-fi show that is really good.  That's an unfair judgment.  It's a show about characters first and foremost that happens to be set in a science fiction setting.  Subtle, I know but a very important distinction.Each and every episode I have seen in the 2+ seasons has been enjoyable and more importantly refreshing and continues the story each and every week.  It makes me wish the writers of LOST would watch this show one weekend...This show continues to build on its characters and engrosses you into their lives, their struggle with survival, each other and even themselves.  All of this wrapped up in the excitement of space battles against the Cylons.  Just like you cannot mistake this as merely a good sci-fi show, it's no clone or a sequel to the original series either.  This is a completely refreshing new show that stands alone.You'll love and hate characters on both sides of this war and each episode builds up more depth to them or insight into their past.  The writers keep you guessing and hungry for more.Whether your a fan of sci-fi or not, this show deserves at least a trial.  If you have ever found yourself wishing for better character development in your routine shows, stop and take a look here.  Drama, Suspense, Character Development, its all right here!Hands down this is my favorite TV show of 2006 and I expect that trend to continue in 2007 as it's just hitting its prime.

This does have some good plots in them, and when they do get to the action, it's really exciting, but they put too much drama in the episodes, and you have to see every single episode or else you won't know what the hell is going on in the next episode. Just like a soap. I hate soaps! If an episode is stupid, why can't I just watch the next one and not be totally lost in the story? The good episodes in this season are ""33"", ""Bastille Day"" (which they copied from the original series' episodes ""The Gun on Ice Planet Zero"" and ""Baltar's Escape""), ""You Can't Go Home Again"", ""Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down"", ""The Hand of God"" (which they copied from ""Lost Planet of the Gods, Part I"" and ""The Hand of God"" - for Christ sakes it has the same name!), and ""Kobol's Last Gleaming, Parts I & II"" (which is a remake of ""Lost Planet of the Gods, Parts I & II""), and of course the miniseries.

It is realistic, for sci-fi, complete with un-inhabitable and inhabitable planets, civil unrest, space combat and travel, and saboteurs. This makes for a thrilling DVD!	5.0	Great Show!

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2CLHSF28BN5EO	"J. Hart ""@jasonahart"""	The miniseries on disc 1 of Battlestar Galactica Season 1 would, as a standalone movie, compete with some of my favorite films. Taken with the rest of Season 1, this is some of the most entertaining television I've ever watched and is a must-see for science fiction fans. Though it's not without the occasional silly trope or unbelievable twist, Season 1 of Galactica stands as evidence of exactly how far the show tumbled in its third and fourth seasons.	5.0	Excellent sci-fi drama	2009-11-20	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3T4T8ULB058J4	J. Hatfield	Consider the review as written from a fan. I used to love the Sci-Fi channel when they had great shows like Farscape, Doctor Who, The Invisible Man, and miniseries like Dune & Taken. Now they show cheap movies, wrestling, and ghost hunter. Anyways, it's always nice to be able to own and watch an entire series without painful sci-fi upcomings & commercials. One thing to note, Series One does include the Mini Series on Disk One, this was a bonus as I thought I would have to buy it seperate.	5.0	From a Fan	2009-05-01	1	0	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3LWRBUFPCFH22	"J. Henderson ""John 'M"""	"Guys & Gals . . .This series rocks. I don't know how many out there watch Anime as in; Last Exiles, The Gundam series, Ghost in a Shell 1&2 series, & Macross Zero (not released in the US yet but can be ordered intl). . . ..but this series has life. . . . The characters have deep backgrounds; the writers spend quality time building them. They display emotion. The emotion is similar to a soap opera but its sci-fi. You care about the characters. I forgot which episode it was but Adama had unforgiving anger all over his face as he held back from strangling Starbuck who had an expression that was priceless . . . .so much emotion. . . you don't find this in other sci-fi flicks. . . .I think the closest would be like in Star Wars Episode 3 when Anakin says ""I hate you"" with so much intensity to Obi-wan . . .You don't find emotion like this on most TV shows. You may find it in the movies. If anywhere you find such intensity in our everyday lives. That's why this series is #1 on sci-fi. . . .It captures an audience who can understand what the actor is going through. You can't find that hardly anywhere.Each episode rolls into the next episode. You just can't watch Episode 9 w/o watching episode 1-8. Or you'll feel lost . . .This is why I keep comparing this to Japanese Anime and Mom's soap operas . . .That's why when you watch this on TV it always shows the viewer what happened in the last few episodes. Its like watching one big movie. . .The CGI isn't on par with Lucas's ILM but its really close. . . I like it. . .The camera angles and the zooming in gives this series so much motion as if the viewer is commanding the camera to move right and zoom in on this. I watched the last episode of the second season . . . .it is truly one of my favorites.  The musical score is so moving, similar to Enya. The acting was top notch. Seeing Baltar nurse the ravaged human-she-cylon was deep. Watching Starbuck turn from the bad A#$ to an emotional wreck when a human cylon could tell that she was abused in her child hood was so moving. . .I'm a hard core sci-fi junkie . . . So I've scene the original BSG and its movies . . .and I have to say the original BSG is of the past . . . TV shows these days' including the sci-fi shows don't mimic the past. Even Star Trek, BABYLON 5, Crusade, SG-1, none of these shows mimic the past. . .In the PAST SCI-FI was a there so that the viewer could escape from reality. . . .TODAY viewers want sci-fi shows with REALITY that seems believable . . .. example if you were to compare the Vipers from the orginal to the Vipers in todays BSG. You could actually imagine the Vipers of todays BSG using thrusters found around the frame to pivot and turn while being at the mercy of space. The orginal series felt like somethin was missing as vipers flew with ease while ignoring the constraints of space. Viewer want to believe what their seeing. Viewers want to see life in their characters. . they want to believe it could happen.I could go on forever . . .. Readers please don't think I'm bashing the original BSG. I'm just letting you know it has its place . . .. Its place is in the past with TV's shows like Buck Rogers and Voyages to the Bottom of the Sea. They are there to remind us how far science-fiction has came; from capturing our imagination with the original BSG to stealing our hearts and minds with 2004-05 version of BSG.Take care and happy shopping . . . .oh by the way Buy this DVD!!! And don't forget to take a look at the Anime I mentioned above!!"	5.0	Its almost like a Japanese anime series . . . .	2005-12-02	13	9	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A237EWD6VMF07Y	J. Howard	"BSG is the best dramatic series ever produced. The writing & acting is unsurpassed. It restores my faith in the ""system"". It's the only dramatic series I've consistently watched in the last fifteen years. But here's my beef.  Why no Blu Ray?  Why does Universal want to reduce its HD sales by half? Are they in the business of making movies, or are they in the business of marketing electronics?  I'm not going to run out and buy a HD DVD player for a few HD-DVD discs. Warner Brothers has recently seen the light, and is releasing movies on both formats. Universal needs to take note. If Universal were to release a Blu Ray version of BSG, I would buy it. But until then, I'll be sticking with my regular DVD set, and spending my $$ elsewhere. The same goes for my Season One Original Star Trek DVD's."	5.0	No Blu-Ray ??	2007-12-04	52	2	50

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	ADSFKIX44X8JV	Jill Guntur	"This re-defined, updated version of the original Battlestar Galactica had an enormous challenge to step outside of the shadow of the first series.  And it stepped up to the challenge and was really a riveting, inventive, great sci-fi series.  And then.... OMG!  Stupidity strikes before the Cylons do.  The cylons machines can look like any human being, and apparently also inject illusions.  by the end of season one, if there had been one more scene of the doctor (who sees and hears the non-existent cylon in his head) being caught in what appears to be lude scenes of self-gratification and lip pursing pretend make out sessions.... well, I was going to root for the cylons to simply wipe them all out.  Any person that enjoys sci-fi has the capacity to leap the boundary of the believable.  Sadly enough, there are too many moments of stupidity toward the end of the season to care whether you do or not.  Listening to the hardened soldiers say the word ""Frag"" and ""Fragging"" became simply laughable and a series with all the promise in the world quickly became a slow burning joke.  Don't waste your money."	2.0	Season starts out on fire.... but cheats you in the end.	2006-01-14	39	19	20

The only bother that I have with the entire season is the lack of bonus features. The podcast from Ron Moore is good and all, it is just that there is no other commentary. It his Ron sitting at home with his wife doing a pd cast. You hear her eating cereal next to him, the cats meowing, random background noises like phones ringing. Which is fine and all, but that is all that is offered. I just wish there were actor commentaries as well.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2YYHEOOMW95FA	J. Kitchen	"I posted a very favorable review of the mini-series that launched this new version of Battlestar Galactica. The series has taken all of the things that were so enjoyable and woven them into a great television series.First and foremost it's a drama about people. If you want trite, craptacular, formula don't look to this show. The writers and the cast of actors and actresses have embodied these characters with more detail and emotion than any other television show I can think of in recent years. Entire episodes go buy without spaceships or planets and we don't mind. We care about the people first, the special effects second. The underpinnings of loyalty, relationships that remain steadfast after 20 years, love and rivalry, purpose and duty, all come to the forefront of this show.The executive producer of the show, Ron Moore, has been very crafty in his vision. Things so painful about the original series are now far more frightning. The bad guy robots, the Cylons, aren't slow moving toasters anymore. They look like us and have carried out the obliteration of mankind with darwin like overtones and a zeal fueled by a religion that holds man as the creator. Yikes! Add in that they've figured out how to use sex as a weapon...The hardcore ""living in the basement of their parents house"" crowd will continue to make savage attacks on this show no matter what. Mercifully the people who live in the real world recognize the product of a tremendous number of talented and gifted people. Ratings have been high for a reason.If Frasier was a weekly half hour of wonderful broadway farce then the new version of Battlestar Galactica is a taunt hour of psychological insight into the workings of real people in a hellish situation.I don't own a single live action television series on DVD or videotape but have pre-ordered this one because I want to watch it again to see what I missed the first time I watched it.This is a show that may ripple through the industry because it proves what Jay Ward knew with Rocky and Bulwinkle: you don't dumb down the material. The kids might not get all the jokes but the adults who do will love it all the more. With Battlestar Galactica you can find episodic sci-fi if that's what you need. If you want something more, human drama that demands emotional investment on a scale rarely seen in the broadcast mediums, it's a meal of plenty."	5.0	One of the best shows on television regardles of genre...	2005-07-25	623	560	63
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3UZFB2LEZYWCT	"JLL ""jamesndir"""	"As someone who grew up watching the original series, I hesitated to watch this newer version.  I am so glad I took the plunge!  It is an awesome series!  They manage to develop the characters with amazing depth.  The story interweaves human and cylon lives over the four seasons in a masterful way.  What is best about the series is the way they plant the seeds of ideas even early in season one that don't grow to fruition until the end of season four.  The themes and sub-plots that flow through the four seasons is absolutely stunning writing.  I can't think of a better written and acted series and there are tons of surprises relating to the cylons and exactly who is one (they can look like humans).Also, to help those who are brand new to the seasons.  You should start out watching: ""Battlestar Galactica: The Mini-Series""  this starts it off (not season one).  After watching Battlestar Galactica: The Mini-Series, then go to season 1 and watch until the middle to almost the end of season 2.  If you want, you can then watch the movie: Battlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition) which deals with the Pegasus and the back story of its crew.  Once you finish the movie, finsih out season two and go to the end (Season 4).  This will keep the story flowing chronologically (I didn't figure this out until I had watched seasons 1-4).  All of these seasons and movies are on Prime at the time of this review (which is where I watched them all).  Enjoy!"	5.0	Awesome series!	2013-07-16	0	0	0

But even in these types of episodes there is a lot of side-plot occurring, so it is not that big of a deal.Favorite bit...

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	ALO7C26NGWH9Y	"JMotts ""JMotts"""	"My best friend had been telling me to watch Battlestar Galactica since last year when the mini-series came out.  I have heard how great it was but have never seen more than a few minutes at a time.  For some reason I always avoided it.  I have no idea why, maybe I'm just cynical when it comes to smart science fiction (or lack thereof) on television and I didn't want to be disappointed.So earlier this week I picked up the boxset, thinking that it was the only way I was going to be able to watch the mini-series and first season so I could find out if it is worth the hype my friend heaped on it.  And I can say with 100% conviction it is an amazing show.In the last few days I have been watching non-stop.  I can't help it, because the show is so addictive.  The characters are complex and interesting with complete backstories and the story is compelling with genuine drama.  Character and story, the two areas that are the weakest parts of most shows are the strongest attributes of this show, which is all the more amazing considering that sci-fi these days focuses on effects.But in addition to multi-layered characters and a great fast-moving story, Battlestar Galactica still has effects better than I've seen in a lot of movies.  The dogfight sequences are all excellent, and for once a show is at least trying to show how fighters in space would be able to maneuver in a zero-g environment, like being able to flip end over end and in 180 degree turns, not just banking like planes in atmosphere.  The effects are impressive and seem very realistic.  The muted sounds in space, the lack of lasers and the overall ""used"" look of the ships and equipment give the setting a substance that is missing in most sci-fi.Overall though, the acting is what really stands out for me.  Every person in this show is great.  Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell have always been terrific actors, and they each bring an understated strength to their roles.  The rest of the cast are also excellent, from the more minor characters playing the hangar deck crew and CIC staff to the major characters, especially James Callis as Gaius Baltar.  There is so much I could say about each actor, from the humans to the Cylons, that I can't fit it into this review.All I can say is that this is the best show I've seen in years, better even than Lost.  This is a complete drama with moments of fun, with more heart than can be imagined.  I can't wait to get through Season 1 so I can try to catch the re-runs of Season 2."	5.0	I'm hooked	2005-09-27	36	33	3

Already being a fan of sci-fi television and film, even with countless glowing reviews and good word-of-mouth talk about this series, I never watched it. I've done this before (chosen not to watch something against my better interest), and it always turns out the same way.Battlestar Galactica is an incredible series that defies the rules of most Sci-Fi television. It's a wonderful story, full of great characters, great acting, and terrific writing. It may not appeal to those who just want no questions asked Sci-Fi, but this is truly a drama set in space.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AQBRMBQ99ESI7	"John A Lee III ""jal3"""	"This new incarnation of Battlestar Galactica is not as good as the original in that it is not as much fun and takes itself extremely seriously. There is none of the repartee that was present in the old series. Some aspects of political correctness seep through (without really harming the story). There is none of the joy that seemed to infuse the original. The music cannot hold a candle to the old theme.This incarnation is also better that the previous one. The bad guys are not as cartoonish. The characters have much more involved motivations and drives. The Cylons are very pleasant to look at and they are also much more insidious, devious and dangerous. There is an element of psychological drama that was lacking in the old show. The Cylon machines having a religion also lend some complications.The names of the characters have been retained from the previous version but they are different. Baltar is a young guy, thoroughly self centered and bad but not bad for the sake being a ""bad guy"". He is a genius but also a dupe of the Cylons and is the reason humanity finds itself in trouble. The Cylons too are different. Instead of being mechanical men, they are human in form; they have migrated from mechanical machines to biological ones and can pass for human. They politicians are not as generally venal but they can come across as clueless...until one has a particularly brilliant insight or observation. Apollo is estranged from his father, Adama, instead of being a buddy and Starbuck is a girl. She likes her cigars like the original but she is a harder and grittier character. The basic forms are retained but the substance is not.Objectively, this series is neither better nor worse than the original. It is just different. Some things remain the same, however. Humanity is in trouble and the writers have a minimal grasp of Newtonian physics. The science is not quite as hokey and the effects are great. Take it for what it is, an entertaining series that will appeal to some but not to others.Synopses of the episodes appear below.1. Pilot - This episode is the mini-series/pilot which sets up all which follows. The mainline cast of characters is introduced as well as their motivations. The basic situation is that humanity is had several decades of peace after a long war with the Cylons. No Cylon has been seen for decades. The peace is about to end. The Cylons attack in a bid to eradicate humanity and most of plan succeeds. The political leadership is destroyed except for a minor cabinet official and so is most of the fleet. Only the aging ship GALACTICA survives as a military force and its systems are way out of date. That is an advantage when dealing with the Cylons. The survivors manage to get together, scrape together some supplies and set out in a bid for the survival of humanity. It is not going to be easy.2. 33- For some strange reason, the Cylons keep attacking the fleeing human fleet every 33 minutes. This quick cycle of constant combat operation is exhausting everyone and the crews are starting to fall apart. Nerves are starting to wear thin. The humans are at a loss understanding this strange cycle. Seemingly, they Cylons could close in and destroy them at any time. They almost seem to be drawing out the hunt, as a cat plays with a mouse. There does turn out to be a method to the madness. One of the Cylon's biological clock is ticking and she will keep the stress up until she gets what she wants.3. Water - A Cylon agent manages to steal some munitions and blow up one of the ships carrying a major portion of the fleet's water. Rationing has to be put into effect with consequences for morale and discipline. The fleet must find water. They must also figure out the source of the sabotage but its hard when you are never sure who with whom you're dealing. Personal relationships and love affairs complicate things even further.4. Bastille Day - A water crisis loomed in the previous episode but water was found just as the show ended. In this episode, we learn how difficult it will be to get that water. Labor is needed. A natural source is a convict ship. They are not to be used as slaves but their participation will earn them points towards early release. The problem is that the prisoners revolt and take hostages. They are led by a notorious terrorist. This episode is actually the most interesting thus far but it is troubling in that it seems to condone terrorism in some cases.5. Act of Contrition - The Galactica's fleet is still taking on water and trying to repair damage. An accident in a landing bay kills a handful of pilots and they are already short from casualties. As a result, Starbuck is assigned to train new pilots. The material she has to work with is not very auspicious but she is even harder on them that anyone expects. She still feels guilt over the death of Apollo's younger brother whom she was assigned to train years ago. He was not qualified but she passed him anyway because they were lovers. Naturally, this leads to uncomfortable situation with his brother and their father. She finally buckles down and starts whipping the new guys in shape when they are attacked and we are set up with a cliffhanger.6. You Can't Go Home Again - Starbuck gets shot down in the previous episode and this one is dedicated to the rescue mission to look for her. She has actually bailed out on a moon and the search includes the entire system. There are some matters of scale which don't make sense here. The commander takes some excessive risks in looking for her and everyone seems to think he is letting personal matters take over for practical ones. This episode exemplifies a weakness found in many science fiction series. The coincidences just seem to build on each other way past the point of believability. Starbuck manages to find a crash landed alien with an air supply and fix its ship which happens to be of Cylon manufacture.7. Litmus - The Cylon ability to appear as humans has finally become public knowledge, after a Cylon agent manages to set off a suicide bomb on the Galactica. This causes major problems as everyone becomes a suspect of either being a Cylon or a Cylon agent. Things are made worse when a crew chief does some illegal fraternizing with one of his pilots. Some of his crew try to cover for their illicit tryst get caught in the lies and make everyone look like an agent. A minor substory involving some humans which were left behind on Caprica over the past few episodes begins to develop some more. Its suspicion all around.8. Six Degrees of Separation - The Cylons want something of Baltar. With him on their side, they have a highly placed agent in the fleet. There are two problems from their point of view, however. He is a reluctant ally at best and he is not completely trusted by the others. They solve these problems in a vicious manner. They frame Baltar as a collaborator. The evidence is pretty damning even though it is faked. He is a collaborator but as a dupe, not an active participant. Baltar comes close to being executed for treason in this one. When he is finally saved, remorse over his false accusation makes him a truly trusted member of the team and his begging for help from the Cylons makes him realize that he is their tool. He will serve them to save himself and because he has the hots for the Cylon known as number 5.9. Flesh and Bone - A Cylon agent is found alive in the fleet. Starbuck is assigned to interrogate the prisoner and find out any information which might be of use to the fleet. She is always a tough character but in this case she is truly vicious. She resorts to torture. The rationale for this is that, whatever their appearance, Cylons are machines. It is not morally wrong to abuse your toaster neither is it wrong to abuse a Cylon, especially if that Cylon has information about a nuclear bomb hidden in the fleet. As usual, the major goals of the Cylons seem to be to cause dissention within the fleet and promote their ""religion"".10. Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down - The cycle of destructive suspicion grows deeper as Commander Adama'a behavior grows strange. He makes secret calls and disappears from the ship for short intervals. When this behavior is combined with the warning from the Cylon agent from the previous episode that Adama is in fact a Cylon, suspicions mount. Baltar has finally come up with his long awaited Cylon detector and the commander comes under more suspicion as he finds ways to avoid having himself tested. Then the reason is revealed. He shows up with Col. TIgh's long lost and estranged wife. She is pretty and a philanderer who causes no end of trouble. Maybe she is a Cylon. She certainly causes enough trouble for one.11. The Hand of God - The fleet is running dangerously low on fuel and scouts are sent out looking for a supply. They finally find one but it is guarded by a Cylon force. The fleet stakes it all on a desperate surprise battle except that it is not that simple. Cylon mysticism plays a part and they finally convince Baltar that he is an instrument of god working for them...I think.12. Colonial Day - The fleet is starting to get its political act together and re-institute former offices. When a congress is called, one order of business is to elect a vice president in case something happens to the current president. The terrorist from several episodes back stands for election and looks to have a good chance of winning. That frightens everyone because they believe he is looking for just such an opportunity to assassinate the president and assume power himself. Baltar, on the other hand, runs as the Cylon candidate. Everyone else thinks he is running with the president's party but the viewers know differently.13. Kobol's Last Gleaming Part 1 - The fleet finally finds a habitable planet that has some eerie facets to it. So much seems familiar. It turns out to be Kobol, legendary planet from which their civilization derived. According to legend, an artifact left back on Caprica, when used in a particular way on Kobol, will show the way to the even more legendary planet of Earth...the goal of the fleet. There are several problems with this plan, however. Caprica is under Cylon control and there is a Cylon base star orbiting Kobol. The president has a plan, though, which makes her seem insane. Her goals set her against Adama and the question is who will be obeyed.14. Kobol's Last Geaming Part 2 - The president manages to convince Starbuck to undertake a high risk mission back to Caprica to secure the artifact which will show the way to Earth. While there, she runs into the crewman who had been left behind. Meanwhile back on Kobol, things are getting more and more weird. Crew members are stranded on the planet. The strange Cylon religion is almost, but not really, made clear. Baltar gets a chance to make a choice for all humanity and there is a coup attempt which may or may not be legal. The season ends with a bloody cliffhanger and little or nothing resolved."	4.0	Mostly about Mindgames	2005-12-23	13	8	5

All characters have flaws and weaknesses that offset their strengths and result in interesting twists and turns to the story line.Since much of what occurs in any one episode depends a great deal on prior story development It is much more satisfying to watch the series in a linier format rather that selecting random episodes for viewing.

It is like watching the Matrix and Star Wars at the same time. It is amazing. There are tons of sub-plots and things that come back around, so to speak. Tricia Helfer (Nr. 6) is worth the price of admission alone. I would pay to watch her read the phone book for an hour. But she also can act. There is ""just enough"" humor in the series to keep it from being too somber, too.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"Much to my amazement, the complete first season of the new Sci Fi Channel television series ""Battlestar Galactica""  will soon be available in a 5 CD set which also includes the original 2003 miniseries. This newly reconceived, darker, grittier version of the late 1970s space opera has received ample critical praise, including a favorable critical look at its developer and producer, former ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" writer Ronald D. Moore, which was published in the July 17, 2005 issue of The New York Times magazine. Moore has written a science fiction epic which resonates completely with the cultural and political atmosphere of our times, drawing upon the ongoing war against Islamofascist terror and religious fundamentalism to describe the conflict between the human Colonial survivors led by Commander William ""Husker"" Adama (Edward James Olmos) and President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) against the synthetic humanoid Cylons who have become God-worshipping fundamentalist religious fanatics dedicated to eradicating humanity.Gone are the ancient Greek and Egyptian-styled ceremonial robes and fighter pilot helmets seen in Glen Larson's original series, replaced by far more professional military officers and sailors who could find themselves at home on a real-life US Navy aircraft carrier or aboard one of EarthForce's (""Babylon 5"") destroyers and heavy cruisers, with a gritty realism that comes straight out of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ample doses of suspense worthy of ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" or the two best episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (""Best of Both Worlds"", Parts I and II, which has the 24th Century USS Enterprise and its crew pitted against the Borg led by a Borg-assimilated Captain Jean-Luc Picard.). The Combat Information Center of Battlestar Galactica more closely resembles the Combat Information Center of a modern American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier or an American Ticonderoga-class Aegis guided missile cruiser than the bridge of any of the starships U. S. S. Enterprise from all of the ""Star Trek"" television series and movies. Our strong sense of the tensions aboard Galactica and other Colonial ships is emphasized by the show's fine cinematography, featuring widespread usage of hand-held video cameras which merely reinforce the realistic aspects of Moore's brilliantly reimagined version of this space opera.Veteran actor Edward James Olmos leads this splendid cast as Commander William ""Husker"" Adama, the commander of the sole surviving Colonial Battlestar Galactica, who is frequently matching wits with Colonial President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), the surviving senior figure in the Colonial government (43rd in the line of succession); together they must lead the human survivors from the deadly Cylon fleet. Jamie Bamber plays Adama's surviving son, Captain Lee ""Apollo"" Adama, one of the battlestar's senior Viper fighter pilots. Katee Sackhoff is Lieutenant Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (a controversial casting move, but one that really works quite well thanks to Sackhoff's fine acting), a rowdy, fun-loving ace Viper pilot who strongly dislikes those in authority. James Callis is Dr. Gaius Baltar, the brilliant Colonial scientist who inadvertently gives the Cylons the keys to the Colonial defense grid, ensuring the success of their devestating attack on Colonial space, virtually wiping out its colonies and military fleet, through his synthetic human Cylon lover Number Six (Tricia Helfer). And then, Grace Park as Lieutenant Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii is absolutely fascinating since she doesn't realize that she may not be human.Forty years after they flee Colonial space (which is comprised of twelve human colonies) for parts unknown, the Cylons return unexpectedly, launching a surprise genocidal attack against the twelve worlds (In Moore's new adaptation, the Cylons are former synthetic servants of Colonial humanity who staged a successful rebellion, not the cyborg descendants of an extinct alien reptilian race in original series creator Glen Larson's late 1970s version. Elsewhere, Moore has admitted that he was inspired by the 9/11 terrrorist attacks in creating his new twist on the Cylon genocidal attack on the twelve worlds.). Only a ragtag fleet of ships bearing 50,000 human survivors escape the attack, protected by the aging Battlestar Galactica, searching for a mythical thirteen colony which may or may not exist: Earth. Meanwhile Commander Adama must contend with ample political intrigue from President Roslin, substantial crew discontentment, and the presence of Cylon saboteurs aboard the battlestar masquerading as members of her crew, as well as the Cylon basestar fleets lying in ambush for the Colonial fleet. Moore and his fellow writers have wrought a harrowing, mesmerizing saga of survival against impossible odds, with some of the most realistic scenes set aboard a military warship that I have seen since ""Babylon 5"". All of the characters have numerous flaws, ranging from a drunken Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) as the Galactica's less than competent Executive Officer, to a frequently rebellious Starbuck, a seriously ill President Roslin, and last but not least, Gaius Baltar, the Colonial scientific genius turned Colonial Vice President, who remains mentally enslaved to his beautiful Cylon tormentor Number Six. In short, this is a superb space opera that is character-driven, not beholden to special effects and technical babble talk, focusing on the complicated relationships of each of the main characters; this certainly makes a very exciting, riveting television drama for viewers to watch. Without a doubt, ""Battlestar Galactica"" has become overnight one of the most popular current American television series, and a worthy successor to both ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"", and especially, ""Babylon 5""."	5.0	Best Science Fiction Space Opera Since Babylon 5	2005-07-24	54	45	9
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	ADB2T5ANPFXLI	"John Manzione ""Publisher - Spinfuel eMagazine"""	"I am a huge SciFi fan, my wife, not so much. Even so, she loves this show as much as I do. This is the finest TV show ever produced. Battlestar Galatica is one of those shows that will be remembered for decades.It's hard to pick a favorite episode from Season One, but if I had to, I say ""33"", episode one. Picks up after the events of the mini-series and deals with the Cylons finding and attacking the fleet every 33 minutes. From the opening scene to the final scene you are rivited to your seat, breathless and in awe. This is Scifi done right, this is TV done right.Some of said that Ron Moore (Exec producer) has gone overboard with respect to the ""darkness"" of this series, but considering the premise how could it not be dark?Unlike most SciFi, Battlestar prides itself on deep character development, tight plots, realism, and timing. Listening to a Ron Moore Podcast (podcasts are produced for every episode and available at the scifi.com web site.)  you can tell this is a man who loves his show and takes tremendous pride in doing the best job he and his crew can muster. Even the actors work as though they understand that what they are doing is different, honest, and important. Yes, important. Sure, its just ""TV"", but its both relevant and vital to the post 9/11 world.I watch about 12 hours of TV a week, and Friday night at 10PM is set aside for another great episode. I would be crushed if this show was somehow cancelled. Had I the chance of meeting Ron Moore I would thank him personally for providing me, and millions of others, such a great TV show.Best Buy is selling Season One on DVD (as other reviewers have pointed out) and its worth the $50 to have the first 13 episodes now, to watch whenever you want. But, that said, this Season One box set is a must-have for any fan of the show. It includes not only the 13-episodes, but also the Mini-Series making it a complete ""up to date"" collection of BSG-2005.Season One will make a great gift to any Scifi fan, and especially those who have seen the show.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1BHUG38P4CGPE	JohnRayJr	"A few caveats: I watch television shows only on DVD through netflix, and only after hearing good things about a series from several people over a long period of time. In other words, I don't watch that much of it, and never follow a show from week to week.BSG is one of the best shows to have come my way in the last five years. But, more than a lot of shows, it's iconoclastic for its genre and tosses out a lot of tried-and-true Sci-Fi rigmarole. So, this is not traditional but well-executed science fiction. This is quite unusual but still well-executed science fiction.So what should you expect?First, the ""exotic"" feel of traditional Sci-Fi is almost entirely absent from this show. Occasionally you'll see a ""centurion"" (robot desiged to kill humans), a battle between space fighters, or ""faster-than-light jumps"" where space ships instantly move from point to point in the universe. That's about it. The plot is constructed so that humans have embraced older technology to survive against an AI rebellion (the Cylons), so you'll even see things like corded-phones. Clothing and hair cuts are also recognizably modern. The characters say ""frak"" instead of ""f*ck"" when they swear, but otherwise there is no future slang. The bottom line is that BSG puts recognizable characters in extraordinary situations and environments. They're in space; they're on the run from a human-created robot ""race"" called the cylons; otherwise, they could be your friends and neighbors. Their motivations are not foreign or exotic or futuristic.This is a show about people in dire straights, trying to make a new beginning. It's also a show about morality and survival. The Cylons, it seems, do not simply want to annihilate people, but they want to ""become human"" in some way or another. Some of are built and programmed to look and act human - can these be killed or tortured without reservation or hesitation? A lot of BSG is about fear, accusations, ""traitors,"" and what kinds of lines can be drawn between ""us"" and ""them.""BSG is also quite ambitious in that it eschews from the beginning having characters who are, on the whole, likable or unlikable. Sometimes you'll admire these people, sometimes you'll be aghast at moments of poor judgment. If you want to grow consistently fond of certain characters, to trust them and believe in them, this show will frustrate you enormously. Everyone makes mistakes in this show, but they're not hopelessly flawed. It's a tough line to walk across the board. I would think it's very difficult to write characters like Commander Adama who function as a father-figure and leader to the entire ship but who (unlike ""Captain Picard"") sometimes just screw it up. The audience has to believe they ""would"" blow it occasionally. For the most part, BSG's characters seem real without seeming flagrantly inconsistent, something the fans appreciate. However, there are times when characters just don't have much to say about serious actions and consequences, and it can be hard to go along with a compounding chain of events. This is why I rate the first season four stars instead of five.A brief example. In the first episode, the humans are running for their lives (in space) and the Cylons catch up with them every 33 minutes before the humans ""jump"" to another point in space. Mid-way through the episode, the commander comes up with a very basic plan to separate the fleet to try and ""shake off"" the cylons. It's hard to believe that this plan was not considered for the first 250 times (literally). I think sometimes the ""drama"" of the show downplays resourcefulness to a questionable degree. No one on BSG is much of a planner, and given the circumstances, that can be little hard to swallow.This is also a visually breathtaking and riveting show. Wonderful colors, compositions, cinematography, etc. There is some CGI, but it never takes center stage. BSG is not built around special effects.It's also a ""serious"" show, and by no means an escapist one. If you want some swashbuckling adventure in your Sci-Fi, see ""Firefly"" (a show that otherwise assumes that humans in space are still humans).That's about it. Well-acted, well-written, largely plausible (with occasionally eye-brow raisers), mature, character-driven. Flawed but redeemable characters, lots of different story arcs that span several episodes. Action takes a back seat (whole episodes go by without so much as a weapon drawn or a punch thrown). If you're intrigued by this desription, this show will fascinate and absorb you. The second season is even better."	4.0	"Fascinating, Character-Driven ""Drama-in-space"""	2008-07-07	1	1	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3F9VH8916IA40	Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...	I'd like to make a little disclaimer before going on. I've never been a sci fi (sorry, SyFy) geek, not in the least bit. Oh, I've enjoyed my fair share of it, from Star Trek to Star Wars, and I've enjoyed it a lot, but I've never been a geek or nerd for either show. Oh sure, the original Star Wars series was amazing, and still a favorite of mine, and Star Trek has some great films too (The Final Frontier, First Contact, and the newer film come to mind) but the prequels ruined Star Wars for me, and for every good Star Trek film there's an equally bad movie (Star Trek the Motion Picture, The Search for Spock). And don't even get me started on the series. In the past I really enjoyed it, but mainly because my dad loved it back in the day and I liked watching it with him, so I developed a likening for the show. However, since coming to Korea, I've decided to familiarize myself with the Trek universe only to realize that the show (Next Generation) was really kind of... cheesy, moralistic, badly acted, and in many cases downright boring. After one season of The Next Generation, I had enough. I wanted something a bit more real.In comes Battlestar Galactica to the delight of this young aspiring sci fi fan, to the rescue as it were after being let down by the great giant of the Sci Fi world. Gods be praised, this show is amazing. In all my years of movie/TV watching I've never been as impressed with an ongoing TV series as I was with this show. Oh sure, I've never been much of a TV watcher, I stick with mini series and movies for the most part, but out of the major show's I have watched at various times(Hero's, Lost) this is by far the best. Well, it, Law and Order SVU, and Southpark, but COMPLETLY different shows, so let's not even try to compare.The twelve colonies of humanity are a peace. Forty years ago, manmade machines known as Cylons, created to make every day life easier, rebelled against their masters thrusting the galaxy into a long and bloody war. At the conclusion of this war the Cylons left the Twelve Colonies to find of home of their home. For forty years nothing is heard from them, until suddenly, without warning, the Cylons launch a devastating surprise attack against humanities defenses. In less than a day the colonial fleet is neutralized, humanities home worlds devastated by nuclear weapons. Mankind's greatest weapons are simply turned off by the superior Cylon technology; human fighters drift powerless in space, the great Battlestars, giant combination battleships/aircraft carriers, are blown out of the sky.The story is familiar to any Sci Fi fan. Humans on the run from killer man made robots in search of the legendary 13th colony, Earth. It was the plot of the old 1970's series, a show with its fair share of followers. I've never seen that show. I don't think I will ever have to. There's simply no way it can match up to anything this show does. Nearly every aspect is perfect; the effects, the characters, the acting, the mood, the mood, the drama, the battles, the political and moral issues it brings up, this show has everything and more. It has achieved a near perfection that very, VERY few other stories in any other genre can match. It's not only fun, its dramatic, its though provoking (in comparison to Wars and Trek at least), it's sexy, and it sounds great to boot. I really have to dig to find anything wrong with it.Okay, first things first, this is a drama yes, but it would be nothing without some epic space battles. Battlestar goes the rout of Star Wars when it comes to space battles, although they do it far better than Wars ever did. Instead of having huge singular starships duke it out, the Battlestar's are more like space aircraft carries whose main purpose is to launch space fighters (Vipers) and use its heavy guns more as suppressive fire for the fighters. There are no laser guns here, no deflector shields, no super duper space torpedoes, no death rays that can destroy planets, nothing fancy like that. Just bullets and missiles. Like a REAL space military would be like. Laser guns, phooey. We don't need no stinking laser guns. Phazers, whatever. Good old lead and explosives work just fine if you ask me. No need to invent some new phang weapons weapon. Shoot a spaceship with a .50 cal and I'm sure it will go down. The fighters these Battlestars launch are really something too. Whereas the W-Wings in Star Wars fly more like real fighters do, the Vipers in this show fly like one would expect a space fighter, not limited by gravity and wind resistance, to fly.Another major plus this show has is the Galactica itself. One of the things that annoyed me most about Trek was the perfect condition the ship (and its crew) was always in. Not a tool out of place, no grease stains on the floor, no dirt on the carpet, not a dirty or wrinkled uniform on the whole ship. Even when the ship is apparently being blown apart you see sparks fly out of the computers, the crew will jump around a little, but in the end the ship always ends up as perfect as it was before. I mean, come on, this is a MILITARY ship for god's sake, am I supposed to believe they spend all their time just clearing it up? Not the case with the Galactica. This is a real military vessel, dirty, greasy, cramped, dark, braking down and showing its age. The ship, quite frankly, is a mess, but it's a beautiful mess. Things that break in previous episodes REMAIN broken as the show goes on. The ship creaks as it turns, the launching bays break down, the ship (gasp) take damage and people die horrifically from fires and from combat wounds. This show seems like the anti Star Trek, and I love it love it love it.If I were to babble on about everything this show does right, I'd be here all night. From the near perfect soundtrack that enhances every single scene, to the uniqly flawed characters who make up this fantasy world, its, as I said before, a near perfect show.Near perfect, but not perfect. There were a few things that bothered me. For instance, Caprica (one of the 12 colonies destroyed by the Cylon nuclear attack) is the set for one of the series major stories, and yet from seeing it you would hardly guess that a nuclear war took place there. In the miniseries we have a scene where we see dozens of mushroom clouds billowing into the air, and yet as the story progresses we see no sign of the damage they must have caused. Cities remain whole, the countryside remains green. If the devastation was half as much as they show the planet would be a radioactive wasteland. Nothing would live there. Also, some of the characters were mis casted. The Chief was a little young to be the senior NCO on the ship, plus he was kind of a panzy at times. The XO had some really great moments, but for every great moment of acting there was an equally bad moment to go along with it.Okay, I'm nit picking, but let that just go to show you how perfect this show is. That I have to point out such small things such as these tells you this show is something you need to see. I promise you will not be disappointed.Reply value; EXTREMLY high.	5.0	Eat your heart out Star Trek!	2010-01-29	3	1	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1KX6UZ0NZYS36	Jonathan E Johns	I agree with many before me who feel the BSG series on discs is very confusing, and very incomplete.  Poorly packaged, and poorly sold.  It could be a studio, it could be the production company, it could be the DVD creator, I am not sure how this particular production was managed.This BluRay set seems to be the best route to go, though, as opposed to some of the boxed sets of multiple seasons.I really wish when I purchase as season of television, especially one that is produced after the series has ended, that it would be complete with all the extras.  I worry that the reason may be that the contracts that were written for rights on web content were poorly written, and that we may never see that content on DVD.It makes me want to author my own collection, and included all the wonderful things myself on a separate disc, including webisodes, soundtracks, etc.It is a great TV series, and it looks great on my big HDTV, glad I got the BluRay, rather than simple DVDs	5.0	BluRay Review, not TV show contents	2011-02-14	4	3	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2AB7I88LE53K4	jonathan Griffith	I have heard good things about this show from some people and have dismissed them as dorks. Then I caught an episode or two of the third season on Sci-fi and thought that it looked intriguing. I ordered the first season and now I am completely hooked. THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION!!!!!!!!!!!!! I then loaned it to two family members who were also skeptical and they both are hooked as well. Fabulously produced, written, and acted. Bravo, would recommend this series to anyone. I believe that this show could have a very broad appeal. Not just sci-fi nerd fodder.	5.0	Wow!!!!!!!!	2007-01-17	2	1	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A13YR3EGZWR27W	Jonathan Zabe;	"In terms of sheer science fiction satisfaction, this has been a most excellent summer. Not only did I discover the estimable Joss Whedon's Firefly, but also the latest reimagining of Battlestar Galactica.In the 2003 miniseries, 40 years have passed since humanity fought against the Cylons they created. There was no clear winner, since midway through the conflict our robotic foes inexplicably took off for the far reaches of space, never to return.Or so we thought. In truth, they came back wearing our skin. Number Six, above pictured cyber-seductress, gets genius and womanizer Dr. Gaius Baltar to unwittingly assist her (it?) into penetrating our defenses. Soon after, the 12 colonies we're living on get hit by nukes. All our ships with networked computers get disabled almost like someone just hit the ""OFF"" switch.Suddenly, the archaic Battlestar Galactica - a ship with no networked computers to speak of and long considered a relic of the First Cylon War - becomes the only hope for the continued survival of our race.This background leads to some of the most gripping television I've ever seen. Rather than just gush endlessly, I'm going to write about my two favorite episodes and why they work.""33""The crew of the Galactica has been awake for over 130 hours. Every 33 minutes, the Cylons catch up with them, and they have to make another FTL (faster-than-light) jump. You've watched Star Trek before; you know that Kirk and company never looked anything worse for the wear, no matter what happened. Matters couldn't be more different on this show. Fatigue and exhaustion abound. Adama, the commander, looks grizzled as hell, with several days worth of stubble. I'd say the large portion of what makes this show so interesting is how believable it manages to be - a feat unprecedented by any other SF I've seen.""Flesh and Bone""As the episode begins, a Cylon agent (who looks human) has been captured aboard a civilian ship. The attitudinal pilot Starbuck is sent in to interrogate the man/machine after being warned that he'll twist around the truth in order to instill seeds of doubt. This guy doesn't look like he's doing so well, judging from his pasty complexion and the amount he's sweating. He has his face down on the interrogation table and admits to praying. His talk of religion is both fascinating and beguiling. This kind of intellectual nourishment works perfectly within the context of gritty realism, combining to make a transcendent viewing experience.BOTTOM LINE: If we're lucky, this show will be around for a good long time."	5.0	Battlestar Galactica: Season 1	2005-10-03	14	14	0

I have been a huge Battlestar Galactica fan for quite a while now, and I am happy that I finally had the chance to pick up the first season on Blu Ray. Of the entire series, season 1 is my least favorite, but this set is amazing. The show looks very unique and good on Blu Ray, not considering the grain from the filming of the series. I especially enjoy this set because it includes the 4 hour mini series that preceded the first season. The mini series is awesome, and I am quite happy to have it on this set. I can only hope that the other seasons look this good when I finally pick those up on Blu Ray. If you cant tell by now, you certainly need to buy this set.

I am not easily moved by television, and yet I sometimes find myself holding my breath watching these stories unfold.  The writers have the guts to explore the characters (JJ Abrams, are you listening) and courageously spend a good deal of time in dialogue.  The action is well done, gritty and exciting.  Edward James Olmos is a incredible to watch, Mary McDonnell is wonderful and Katee Sackoff is a force of nature. I am shocked that I like this show as much as I do.

Usually I think Hollywood is too stupid to come up with original ideas anymore and that remakes are pathetic- but this is superior- GREAT show. It is not without flaws here and there.  They should spend more time and money on original props.  It is annoying to see space men from another star system using a Dualit toaster from Williams Sonoma- and one of the writers is obiously a bitter chain smoker- what the hell is up with all of the smoking on a spaceship? And Chief's wife looks like she is 10 years old...but in spite of this it is a great fracking show and you will not be able to stop watching it.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	When I first heard that the Sci-Fi Channel was making a mini-series based on the classic sci-fi series Battlestar Galactica, I had my doubts. I could not see how they could do justice to the original show without ruining it. And not only that, but they were making the Starbuck and Boomer characters women. In fact I did not watch the mini-series until it was announced that they were turning it into a series.Boy was I shocked when I finally watched the mini-series. It was an excellent re-interpretation of the original series and in my opinion it was better than the original series. After seeing the mini-series, I could not wait for the series to premiere. Once that first episode aired I was hooked. The characters and storylines are well written and the actors give great performances especially Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck and Edward James Olmos as Commander Adama. Yes, the women who play Starbuck and Boomer do excellent jobs. The actions scenes look great, both the space battles and the ground battle between humans and Cylons. And speaking of Cylons, I love the idea of the Cylons looking human and making one of the main ones a bombshell female is ingenious.This is an awesome 5 DVD set containing all 13 Season One episodes plus they have also included the original mini-series as well. This set is also packed with loads of extras including episode commentaries, deleted scenes and documentaries. This is truly an excellent set for an extraordinary show.	5.0	Even better than the original series	2005-09-29	22	20	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	ATWMEHGIX4WYD	Joshua Hampton	Military SciFi is such a difficult genre to get right.

If you are looking for a good Military SciFi show I would go watch SG1. If you haven't seen it already, it's a lot better.	3.0	ok I guess	2014-03-06	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	The fist season starts out fast and strong.  Battlestar Galactica and the fleet it protects have made over two-hundred jumps trying to outrun the Cylons who seem to be able to track them through jumps.  Getting out of this has Adama and the president making very tough decisions.  From there the series develops quickly.  We see lots more about Cylon agents and some of the sleeper agents.  We see the fleet have to locate resources and deal with dissidents within the fleet.  The presidency gets challenged and a Vice President is elected.  Adama and the President have a showdown.  The fleet discovers Kobol and gets a step closer to discovering the location of Earth.  Finally the season ends with a triple cliffhanger that will want you to go right into season 2.0.Tight scripting and excellent acting really make this series work.  Although a science fiction show it is first a top-notch drama.  Although early advertisements said that the mini series was included, it is not included in this set.  Therefore you may want to get the miniseries if you have not seen it yet.  Season one is short but it is filled with more action, drama, and plot advancements than most shows can do in several seasons.  An excellent series and one worth owning.

I dislike the RMA process anyway, and the problems go beyond scratched discs.I am not criticizing the show, but I am very disappointed with the packaging of the set. Placing the discs flat on paperboard does not jive with those who want scratch-free discs. Discs four and five have show-stopping scratches that the Toshiba HD-A2 can't read through, resulting in skippy playback.I recommend you buy the set - many of the discs show no scratches. Move the discs immediately to standard DVD cases and COMPLAIN to Universal about the scratched discs.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3RCODGV440VDY	"Juan M. Millan ""CrossFade"""	From the title of this review your probably thinking that I'm refering to the 2nd coming of Battlestar Galactica when in fact I'm refering to the fact that this is the best sci-fi space show since Firefly. Where Firefly failed, BG is succeding in drawing in a loyal and huge fan base. The ratings really couldn't get any better. And when you watch the mini-series that started it all which is included in this set, you to will know why this has become the Sci-Fi channels biggest draw. You'll be hooked on the characters and there own stories as they struggle to survive the fall out of a war they never knew they where in and a war that has left them struggling to find salvation.Taking it's basis from the original, this show has quickly come into it's own, and has made it's self one of the best dramas on TV. Not just a sci-fi show but a real adult drama dealing with real life issues and dilemas that we still face today. Some people may just see the name and put it off thinking it's just another 'space show' when in fact they'll be missing out on what some are calling the best show on TV. I became a believer shortly after purchasing this set, you will too because once your done you will want to go out and buy the next one, believe me when I say this.This show is that good. There's a reason why this show is getting it's own spin-off prequel series, there's a reason why Sci-Fi picked it up so quicky, there are reasons why the makers are in talks for a feature length film. This show IS that good.	5.0	The Second Coming	2006-06-23	6	5	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AQV7N4Q522IGP	Jules	THIS IS NOT A SCI-FI SHOW. Okay, technically it is. But the people who label it as sci-fi and dismiss it out-of-hand are missing out on one of the best dramas on television. And the people who can't forgive it for not being the hokey original series are missing out as well. Everybody needs to stop bringing their preconceived notions to the show and just let it be what what it is: a thought-provoking, nail-biting, well-planned and -written, supremely entertaining drama. That happens to be set in space.Don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a show by its genre. This one is well worth watching. You won't regret it.	5.0	Excellent show	2007-01-18	3	2	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1L3WFTQJ257	Julian Dwyer	I love science fiction. With that said, I love to see when it's beautifully executed, whether in print or on screen.Battlestar Galactica Season 1 is full of promise. But sometimes it falls flat, and unfortunately sometimes happens a little too frequently to be forgiving.I know it's the first season, but I have some issues with holes in the storyline, which I won't divulge here for fear of it spoiling it for some. But watch it, I think you'll see they're apparent.The special effects are ok. I know it's a television mini series, but some of the effects really are quite lame. For the life of me, I don't understand why a futuristic society capable of faster than light speed would use 20th centurty 8 bit graphics on their HUDS. Just an observation...Very rarely are sex scenes important to the actual story development or character development. And in this case, there's a lot of unnecessary sex- bordering on soft-core porn and some of the times, just ridiculous and more of a comedic effect, than is necessary. In fact, I'd say that helped seal this 3-star fate. They were unnecessary and certainly not titillating.So far, Season 2 has been much better, but like the first, it's wrought with bad dialogue and acting.After watching Falling Skies, this is definitely a distant second place.	3.0	Good- not great	2013-03-24	0	0	0

This is a much darker series, which conveys the drama and instability of the human race vs the Cylons.I did enjoy that the first few shows had the cc option available, as the audio portion is often very soft spoken words, with loud backgrounds.

This series tackles some of the same questions as TNG, but takes a much darker look at humanity in the process.  It is suspenseful, exciting, surprising, and satisfying.I was heartbroken when I finally finished the last episode.  The writing is spectacular, as is the acting.  The effects are also great, but it's the way it all comes together in a meaningful story that causes us to question our own morals that makes it superior.  This is Sci-Fi at its best.

Certainly, there are occasional miscues and lapses in the writing, but overall it is a very entertaining drama. The pilot episode starts a bit slowly, but as the season unfolds, there is more than enough suspense to keep you interested, and most every installment ends in some kind of cliffhanger that will probably bait you into binge-watching. As the series goes on, it has a lot of fun debating between mono- and pan-theism, which is also fun. Good storytelling, compelling characters, and plenty of dramatic conflict.	4.0	70s Science Fiction Rebooted as Mythology	2013-12-30	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1ZSLNFM58SCHY	J. Widrig	As the debate trudges on as to if the new BG is worthy of the old, I can say that it *is* the most outer space oriented show on TV these days. As most of the new Sci-Fi on TV seems to be 1950's style invasion/paranoia, BG sticks to its space-based format with a thick, swirling coat of character driven drama. Special effects and post-production are top quality, and the writing is consistently good. And Mary McDonnell and Edward Olmos head an excellent cast.The only glaringly questionable issue of BG is the way it's aired and released on DVD. Chopping a season in two and airing them during the other shows off-season is one thing, but releasing said truncated season on DVD before the second half airs seems kinda greedy. Who here bought the mini-series, only to buy season 1 that *included* the mini-series? I hope we're not asked to rebuy season 2.0 when season 2.5 gets released in the bigger Complete Season Two (with deleted scenes and commentary and another trading card and ect.) I think I'll wait.Regardless, however they air it, I will watch, and be happy, and I can finally stop cursing FOX for cancelling 'Firefly' and UPN for cancelling 'Enterprise'.

Yes, things on the show build up gradually but by the time of the season finale, it all comes together.

It's amazing that they are able to even get up in the morning, put their pants on and keep one step ahead of the cylons.In spite of that, it's a fantastic show!It somehow works quite well.My biggest complaint;there's like 6 shows to a season!maybe 8, I think 6 though.For such a great show, it's incredibly short for a season.I don't know why, maybe they didn't think it would flyso they just produced a few.Here's some advice for the makers of BSG:Make more episodes, like 22 episodes for the season like every other tv show!!If you haven't seen BSG, give it a try, it's great!If you have seen the original or haven't seen the original since the 70's watch that one to.You'll love starbuck and appollo running around in their capes!!It's hysterical!"	5.0	The Dysfunction of Humanity	2005-09-20	15	8	7

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1HY8WYJ4U763N	Keith Julson	When I heard BSG season 1 was being released in HD and not Blu-Ray, this is why I purchased an HD DVD Player. Even though HD didn't last very long, I still have this season 1 set and the player, and take it out from time to time to watch. The quality is excellent, the packaging is good, the only disappointment is the spindle the CD's attach to are made of this silicone rubbery stuff and you have to work to get the CD's to snap into place for storage. My only concern is after some time has passed (several years?) the silicone may eventually dry out and become brittle, which will then won't be able to store the CD's in the case anymore. But other than that, anyone who is a BSG fan and still has their HD player, needs to add this to their collection. Of course I paid a lot more for season 1 than what it is being sold for today.  :-)	5.0	This is the reason why I purchased a HD DVD player.	2011-09-23	1	1	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2FTCPS9GFBSG2	"Kevin A. Johnson ""Jazzist"""	"I'm old enough to have watched the original series and I enjoyed the campy ""let' s not take ourselves to seriously"" feel. The original had great actors Lorne Greene, Jane Seymour, Ray Milland (Pilot) to name a few. John Colicos was the ultimate villain, no angst with this guy. Not only was there an ensemble cast but each week cameo appearances by Fred Astaire, Lloyd Bridges and many others. One of my favorite characters was Colonel Tigh played by Terry Carter. So with excitement I watched this remake of a classic 70's show.Imagine my horror when I saw this rubbish that seems to bear little resemblance to the original. I think the people behind this show had the original described to them without ever watching one episode. Each and every character has been changed for the sake of change. Adama was regal now militaristic. Can someone tell me why the blacks are gone? (I guess because blacks can't afford cable so who cares.) Starbuck was a bad boy womanizer but now is a female. So Apollo's wing man is female. The Starbuck character is the typical male warrior who is dysfunctional except in combat. A female in this role is hard to buy, since most dysfunctionals are male(see ""The War Lover""). A could only stomach part of the pilot. I thought I was watching Melrose Place in space instead of a first rate Scifi. The characters seem flat and one dimensional. The worst part is how seriously this show takes itself. I don't really understand the popularity of this show. It is on the Scifi channel and can't have the audience (or Budget) of a CSI. Try to watch a couple episodes for free. Firefly is a decent show with an original concept(and at least it was on network TV). I would say don't waste your time or money unless you really like this kind of tripe."	1.0	Battlestar Unwatchable!	2007-06-01	52	10	42
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1KHV6Q0FTCX2I	Kevin Bohacz - bestselling techno-thriller author	Battlestar Galactica is perfect blend of myth, action, and sci-fi. The screenwriters who created this series deserve a great deal of applause for writing intelligent and gripping stories. I wish Sci-Fi channel would return to making shows like this one. I have now watched the series three times over and I am old enough to have seen the original series as a young adult in 1978 on TV when it originally aired. If you have never watched Battlestar Galactica then stop reading this review and watch it! What are you waiting for?

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1XKFAUI3GWD3M	Kevin Moore	I had watched part of the original Mini-series and seen parts of various episodes during its first run but I wasn't a great fan.  None of the characters caught with me and I wasn't keen over some of the plotlines.So I can't explain why I bought the boxed set when I saw it.  I brought it home and started to watch.  I found myself addicted.  The storylines flow from episode to episode so you tend to watch them in groups.  Difficult to watch one and walk away as it is not self-contained.  I found I always watched 2 episodes at at time, often 3.  Unfortunately the first season was a short season and so I quickly came to the end of the series.I found I did not mind the changes from the original series (ie Starbuck being female over male or Boomer being a Cylon).  In many ways I did find the changes interesting.  There was character development but in many cases some of it was irritating to the point of unacceptable.  Michael Hogan's character as the Ex. Off. is hard one minute and then allowing things to slip the next.  Starbuck would have been in the brig much more than she was - I guess they tend to be forgiving when there is only 400,000 humans left.There are some basic plot problems such as if you are running from an enemy then why don't you keep running?  They keep dropping into space followed by the Cylons.  Since the planets are destroyed then just go.The President is irritating and I hope she is voted out for someone new.The Cylons as humans are interesting and the subplot of what is happening back on occupied Casopia is actually more interesting than much of what is happening back on Galactica.The year ends with too many unsettled points so that it doesn't feel like a year ending.  It's not a cliffhanger as much as it is stopped 2 episodes too soon.	4.0	I wasn't a fan until this box set...	2005-12-11	12	5	7

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AKS9SJTHTU0OM	K. Gordon	One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I've turned a lot of friends onto it, haven't gotten a complaint yet.As with all complex shows, it may take a few episodes to get into themood, the pace, the feel. But trust me, it's worth the investment oftime.The Blu-rays have been derided for not being reference quality, butmuch of that has to do with the look, lighting, and style of the show.They are less than perfect, but - at least to my eye - they're still anotable step up from the regular DVDs.  Whether the extra cost isworth it to you is a matter of taste, and the size of your TV screen.While I wish they were even better, I'm still happy I own the serieson blu.	5.0	Brilliant, exciting, thought provoking science fiction - and a comment on BR quality	2011-11-09	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A32D3SIQGJX2SV	Kimmy11	"When my husband told me that he wanted to buy the Battlestar Galactica-Season One DVD Set for a whopping $50, I said ""No way,Jose"". But one day, after spending a day out with my girlfriends, and leaving him home with our 2 little girls, I decided to surprise him with it. Needless to say, I, too, became addicted to this wonderful new series. The ""New"" Battlestar Galactica really does ""break the mold"". Unlike the original which was much more heavy-handed on the sci-fi side and appealed to a predominantly male audience, this series appeals to both men and women. It is one of the few TV shows where women have equal footing to the men. Mary McDonnell as President Roslin makes it plausible to think that a woman (a ""kindergarten teacher"" no less) is more than capable to rule the universe. I'm not sure who plays Starbuck (Tricia ___) but she, too, is another strong woman character who is the best pilot among a sea of (hunky) men :-)  I think it was a stroke of genius to make Starbuck a woman in the new series (Starbuck was a man in the original series). Then there's the romance between Sharon and Helo and the sexual tension between Starbuck, Dr. Gaius, and Captain Apollo not to mention the relationshio between Dr. Gaius and Number Six that keeps the screen steaming hot !In summary, I have to agree with the statement that it is indeed ""the best show on television"". It has excitement (=lots of explosions), suspense, romance, and most importantly, a stellar cast. I would also argue that the new series is more metaphysical in nature vs sci-fi. I agree that it is a bit heavy-handed with the whole religion thing but it does explore basic human yearnings and hopes and questions about what makes us human.Last night, we saw the last episode of Season One and I panicked.

Both are revolutionary for the time in which they were done.  The series as it stands now keeps me coming back week after week just as the original did.  Edward James Olmos is not Loren Green but he's just as good.  Richard Hatch (formerly Captain Apollo in the original)is also in this series and he does a wonderful job as a pain in President Roslin's neck.  And the character of Dr. Baltar is INCREDIBLE.

This is an excellent and very real human drama. There are some parallels with the real world, Ron Moore has mentioned it and I don't think it's a bad thing. In my opinion, it would be a mistake to not allow any real world influences.TV critics have heaped this drama with praise. In addition to CSM, NEWSDAY has also named it ""the best show on TV."" TIME Magazine placed it among the top six dramas on TV. The staff of TV WITHOUT PITY named it ""the best new show of 2004-2005"" and tied it with Deadwood as the ""best drama.""

They're whining over Starbuck's sex-change somehow managed to drag the mini-series DVD kicking-and-screaming down to 3 1/2 stars.  It's nice to see that the first season managed 4.  I'm guessing that if you removed all purists it would manage at least 4 1/2.But, anyhoo, this series is great.  It has awesome acting, good CGI, and well thought-out stories (some purists have actually tried to reverse-rationalize plotholes into it...it hasn't worked).  With the exception of ""Act of Contrition"" (which actually improves with re-watchings) every episode is a masterpiece in and of itself, in addition to being a part of something extrodinary beyond words.Let me put this simply:If you're going to watch this show, be ready for something beyond the usual.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2FSIOT3YB9EJU	Lance Funston	While the original BSG circa 1978-1979 was blessed with a great premise and was riding the coat tails of Star Wars with its Viper and Raider dogfights across the galaxy, it was hampered by its cheezy production design and sometimes formulaic writing and performances. The new BSG takes the basic premise of humanity fleeing from inhuman cylon exterminators and gives it a real sense of jeapordy and humanity. The series is well cast and acted (especially Edward James Olmos who was born to play Commander Adama), and follows the new trend of cable serial drama in skillfully weaving and continuing multiple plotlines. My only issue with the new BSG? At times the costuming and production design (outside the actual ship) seems very uninspired. Many scenes on the destroyed world of Caprica seem obviously shot in some outdoor mall in Toronto with a full orange filter on the camera, and many of the props don't even give a nod to the possibility of a more advanced technology or even culture different than our own. Mostly however, you will likely find yourself too engrossed in the gripping story of BSG  to care.	5.0	Gripping retelling of the BSG myth	2006-11-02	4	4	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1QIIDI2S7YVN9	Larry Isom	I first was introduced to Battlestar Galactica on the Syfi channel when it was in its 3d or 4th season.  It was a interesting series, but I didn't really understand the relationship of the main players.  But after joining Amazon Prime a few months ago, I finally checked out Amazon Prime Videos through my Smart TV.  Setting up the account was real easy since I was already a Prime member and I was searching the free Amazon Prime movie and TV sections within minutes.  They have quite a selection of older movies and TV series and that's when I ran across the Galactica series.  After watching the Mini series from 2003, all the characters became clear and how they fit into the storyline.  I enjoyed the Mini series so much the I have gone through the first season to see how the series progresses.  As far as Sci-fi series goes it is one of the better ones that have been produced and I look forward to the remaining three seasons that Amazon has to offer.  As for access to Amazon Prime Video's itself, for the most part has been pretty straight forward.  Only had a few times that I was unable to access the Video section.  Either Amazon's server was too busy or my Wi-Fi wasn't up to speed.  Either way its only happened a few times and I have never had a night that I couldn't access my video of choice.	4.0	Battlestar Galactica using Amazon Prime	2014-02-08	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1C48Y5ELD34PV	"Lawrence Larson ""shellback84"""	I am a person who was born in 1951 with science fiction and space discovery in my vanes. I was born in an era when Science Fiction was just staring to become popular along with the U.S. Space Program. I grew up on, The Twilight Zone and the original, The Out Limits. I remember when Star Trek was being advertised as a new show in 1966 and counted down the days when the first show came on. My point? I have almost 60 years experience with science fiction and this show is not the best Science Fiction show ever, like many others have claimed. It is not bad but the the huge moments of its illogical and almost soap opera style, has made me realize that I do not like this new style of Science Fiction that has become popular today. Today's fans want this kind of Science Fiction but I am old school and find much of it boring and yes silly. Let me make clear that I do not think it is bad, it is just not that good. I will not watch it past the first year. Below are a few of the areas of this show that I have a very hard time with.1. It is made obvious from the show that the human fleet have faster than light capability and by the mid show in the first season they have left their solar system and the planet they call home. So why would the Cylons continue to chase down the humans when they did in fact win the war? Let the few humans left go about their business and the Cylons can build a new empire on the planet they took from the humans?  The Cylons are machines but they are still wasting and using huge amounts of energy chasing down a race they defeated. I see no logic in this at all.2. This next part of ill logic has me completely annoyed. The Cylons killed, and destroyed most all of the human race because of their biological imperfections. However, the Cylons create new biological humans to replace the humans and have biological flaws themselves. Example, their need for sex, in fact the human Cylons love sex. Or Cylons can fall in love with humans and betray their missions. What the hay?3. What is the purpose of writing a script that makes the bad guys look nicer and better than the guys or humans we are rooting for? I find that almost disturbing.4. I am sick and tired of that blond Cylon bimbo slobbering all over that Doctor. Enough already.5. Cylon,Cylon who is the Cylon? I am a little more than half way through the first year and I am already tired of this silly find the Cylon game.6. These people all dress like we do today here in today's America with no regard for cultural differences. All I got to do is go to Japan and can see the different dress and culture differences between our two nations, in this show it is two different worlds and solar system. What the hay?7. What is up with all these press people? I get there is a President but where are these press people going to print their stories, at their bunk at the space ship they are in? Remember every human person is trapped in a space ship of some kind with limited space, water and food. I doubt if this were real there would be much in recreation of any kind. I can only imagine how suffocating this could be in real life.And yes I can go on but I think you can now understand my reasons as to why I do not think this show is a great or even good Science Fiction. Like the 3 stars I gave it, it is okay.People who should watch this show are younger people who like this sort of action and this type of Science Fiction. Also people who do not care about detailed science fiction or science facts and many people are fine with that but I am not. Active duty military people might like this show, especially active duty Navy people because of its references to Aircraft Carrier operations and the military talk and the military buddy support groups. This is one of the reasons it gets three stars from me as I am retired military.If you are not sure about starting this show then see if your local library has the shows mini series and check it out, besides it is free and what have you to lose? If you love the mini series then you will love the show and then it would be a good time to buy it.	3.0	Not the greatest Science Fiction TV series and lacks important logic.	2014-03-01	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A7TVOXIU1CFCR	Leighton Connor	You don't have to be a fan of the original 70's Battlestar Galactica to enjoy this reimagining.  I've never seen the original show, and don't really care to, but I love the new show.  It's smart, well-written, well-acted, and very, very dark.  The show starts with the destruction of civilization, and follows a small band of survivors on the run, so the dark tone comes naturally from the premise.Most of the characters on Battlestar Galactica are good people trying to do the right thing, but it's never clear just what the right thing to do is.  Almost every episode includes a difficult ethical dilemma.  The show is ambiguous and morally murky, with no easy answers.  Which is not to say that it's boring.  There are also plenty of exciting spaceship battles.On the whole, this is the best TV science fiction since Firefly.	5.0	Battlestar Galactica Season One is Very, Very Good	2006-03-14	2	1	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A11SDJQFJJTW0Z	"L. G. Mabry ""assumedname"""	Anyone who views the new Battlestar Galactica with objective eyes would have to agree with the idea that this show far surpasses the original. This is how remakes should be made: Not slavishly copying the original, or smugly commenting on it from time and distance, but discarding the chaff and retaining the aspects that of the property that remain relevant.Admittedly, I was never a big fan of the original show. I missed the first episode way back when (it aired the weekend I went away to college), and I never really caught back up. That, plus I harbored a grudge for what Glenn Larceny (as I remember author Harlan Ellison calling him) did to Buck Rogers. But Ronald Moore and Co. have taken the concepts of the original and done an incredible job of thinking them through.The most obvious alteration is the human-appearing Cylons. While this could be considered to be done out of budgetary concerns, it serves the purpose of increasing the dramatic tension as members of the Galactica's fleet serve as Cylon moles, sometimes against their wills. Additionally, the political and spiritual connotations have been played up this time, at no expense to the action. And I would even go so far to suggest that the conflicts among the humans here, especially toward the end of the first season, are nearly as hard-fought as the battles with the Cylons.One complaint about the series that possibly has some credence is that the show is relentlessly bleak. This is arguably true. I, for one, always watch the subtitle at the beginning of each episode that counts the number of human lives remaining on Galactica and the other ships from the initial 50,000 (on the 8/5/05 episode, the count was down to 47,000 and change). While things could lighten up a little for the fleet, we need to consider that the fate of the human race is at stake here at all times. Also, I have heard complaints that, among the racial/gender switch-ups done among the characters (i.e., Starbuck/that guy from the A-Team to Starbuck/attitudinal blonde chick)that African-Americans actors have taken a hit since Boomer and Tigh are now played as an Asian woman and a drunken Caucasian man, respectively. But the greater spectrum of races and sexes on display is encouraging. Just give us a good Black regular character soon!Finally, if great effects, powerful writing, and good acting aren't good enough for the diehard Galactica fanboys, there's this: the beloved Original Apollo, Richard Hatch, has a recurring role. So the new guys respect the old school, after all.	4.0	THIS is how remakes should be done!	2005-08-08	35	31	4

It's intense and well acted with tight continuity.  How could anyone watch this on TV?  The commercial breaks would drive me nuts!  Much better to wait and buy the DVD set and just kick back in front of a nice big TV and hang on for the ride!The main reason I didn't like the mini-series was that I didn't like the characters.  They were well acted, but I just didn't like them.  The series seems to have corrected that problem and now with some character development, especially with Starbuck, I find I really care about these people and want them to survive.  And I so far haven't seen any long pointless scenes of Boltar having sex with himself while six plays around inside his head.  That's another thing that I didn't like about the mini-series.I deducted a star for these reasons:1.  The soundtrack is cool and refreshingly different, and dark and dreadry, and it gets monotonous after a long while.  I wish there was a little more variation here.2.  Just a little more comic relief.  Just a little.  I know this isn't a comedy and they're not trying to redo the original series the same way.  But just a laugh or two every now and again would help a bit.3.  I like the new ""edgy"" camera shooting style.  I feel like I'm on the ship with them.  However, sometimes characters are standing and talking and they're moving left, right, and up and down during the scene like the camara man is not holding the camera steady, and it just looks like an amateur home-video only with expensive equipment.  This isn't edgy; it's annoying.But these are nits.  I really like this series."	4.0	It works!!	2005-11-10	7	6	1

This is the best thing to watch on t.v right now.All of the characters are very distinct and well-defined; the acting is great; the space battles (and sfx that go with it) are excellent; each episode is unique while still being relevant to the theme of the series.  The only thing I don't like about the cast is how puny the actor for Apollo is.  Can someone tell this guy to do a few push-ups?  Also, he comes across a whining Mama's boy (even though he doesn't have a mom).Outside of that, I highly recommend this show.  Although it's set in a futuristic space enviroment, it deals with issues that are still relevant to our society.  Or if you just want to see a good t.v show with occassional kickbutt space battles, then don't miss this show!  It's almost perfect.	5.0	best show on television!	2006-01-04	10	9	1

One problem is that there's a battle between those who like the cheesy 70's version and those who like the more recent remake. That sort of thing always happens when there is a remake, but Battlestar fans take it to a far more hostile level. The battle against the original series fans has become a battle against anybody who has anything critical to say. Anybody who offers criticism is accused of only watching ""three"" episodes, but the drop in ratings proves that MILLIONS of people watched more than ""three"" episodes and MILLIONS have stopped watching. The cheesy 70's series has nothing to do with the growing loss of interest in the new show. People tuned in and watched then slowly dropped out. Look at the ratings. ENTERPRISE had better numbers!

Anything with ""Galactica"" in the title must have funniness, right?  This show, however, is mostly too bleak for humor.)First, the obligatory and nitpicky CONS:(you'll probably love the show IN SPITE OF these flaws)(1) Price!  Unclear why these DVD sets are so expensive...(2)  The Cylon Number 6/Dr. Baltar imaginary relationshipOk, I'm not a dude, so I probably don't appreciate ""the sexy"" of No. 6 as much as male viewers might.  The idea of No. 6 being in Baltar's head has a lot of potential.  BUT, the writers don't yet know the ""endgame"" here, and have yet to tap into this potential!  For example, it would be cool if imaginary No. 6 mainly reflected Baltar's inner psyche/psychoses (e.g., ""Six Feet Under."").  Or, maybe imaginary No. 6 could be a separate entity with a sinister agenda: true, evil, and scary (e.g., ""The First"" evil in ""Buffy: the Vampire Slayer."")  But, since the writers are seemingly unsure of what's going on here, this device eventually becomes aimless, overused, and ultimately yawn-worthy.  [Also, this preoccupation with No. 6 renders Baltar's relationships with the rest of the cast practically nonexistent, making any group scene with Baltar awkward indeed.  That highly paranoid people of power would trust him, that he could charasmatically sway public opinion, or that he could convince Starbuck to spend ANY time with him at all...well...these things seem a little bit ludicrous.](3) Show not Tell.We all know that ""showing"" characters to us is better than blandly ""telling"" us about them.  (On ""Lost,"" for example, we know where all the characters have been, and how it impacts where they're going.)  I understand from the show that Dr. Baltar is smart, but I have yet to SEE evidence of it (other than his magical detector.)  After all, wouldn't No. 6's allure be even more powerful if she corrupted an essentially decent, genius-man to ""the dark side""?  The show sort of gets this ""showing"" right every now and then, but not often enough!  (The character that I cared about the most out of the first 2 seasons?  Anders!?!  Is he even close to a main character?  Nope.  But they introduced him well.  So far, he's a consistent character.  More of this, please!)(4) The Mysteriously ""Unexplained:"" Sci-fi that's more ""fi"" than ""sci""I'm probably more critical of the ""science"" than most, as a card-carrying phD scientist.  It's tough not to have the token nod to explaining stuff - even if it is hokey.  I've listened to some of the commentary and the defensiveness of the creators here...but I think they should just admit that they don't have any sciency nerds on staff (like they do on other nerd shows, like ""Futurama."")  They just don't ""get it,"" and they don't get what they don't get...and they also don't care.  Which is certainly a way to go (hey, they can't be experts in everything!)  But, to pretend that it's a completely ""realistic"" space show without its moments of science-related eye-rolling...dream on!(5) Where does the audience live?The show is shot as if there isn't an audience most of the time, and this is both good and bad.  It's refreshing because exposition scenes generally don't bog things down.  BUT, there's no place that the audience fits into this world.  We're not ""invited in"".  We may see characters laughing or find ourselves intruding into a conversation where characters are joking around, but we're not part of it...we're not laughing-with or even laughing-at the characters or situations.  [We're not laughing, period.](6) Consistency/continuity.  The writers seem to want to ""keep us on our toes.""  There's little consistent morality on the show, or even within the same character.  Decisions, emotionally or logically driven, aren't always earned/explained. Some things that are a big deal in one episode are completely ignored in the next.  I guess this allows them to do ""stand-alone"" stories that wouldn't actually work if the characters had to acknowledge it and live with each other later.(7) Decisions/actions have few consequences!There's an episode where one fighter pilot gets stranded.  It's obviously not for ""the greater good"" that our crew tries to rescue her.  Even though they eventually wise-up and make the tough decision to give up, it turns out that it doesn't matter one way or another because the audience already knows that she'll find her own way back.  Or...there was this other time where the commander had to decide whether or not to murder somebody...and then the desired outcome is conveniently (randomly?) provided by another character.  I understand that writers need license sometimes, but there's an awful lot of ""hey, the audience just have to give us this one"" going on here.(8) Same plot, different characters.Ok, yes, it would be a big deal to figure out what the frack to do if humanity was on the brink of extinction.  But the themes of many episodes are the same: who's in charge, and how far are we willing to go to get our own way?In spite of these minor criticisms, I NEEDED to watch all of these episodes on DVD, for there were several really great episodes when the show was firing on all cylinders.  And some of the themes are highly relevant to our times...Some of the PROS:(1) The writers of the show make an effort to blur the distinction between Cylon and Human.  It's the show's strength!  The fact that the show deliberately doesn't include the audience, from the way that it's shot on down, distances the audience from the Humans.  We, the audience, aren't part of them, the Humans.  And we, the audience, see these Humans as slightly out of focus or a little off-beat: almost-but-not-quite (Uncanny Valley-esque).  The audience experiences how a Cylon might feel on the ship: present, but not a part of this world.  It helps the audience to be a little more objective about the flaws of our human race.  (Is it worth saving?)(2) The situations in this show give everybody chances for great heroism and great acts of desperation.  The whole spectrum of the human condition is seen here, from the good to the bad to the ugly.(3) Although the messages are blatant and repetative ""we'll keep fighting until we can't"" (I can't resist a plug for ""Angel"" here...how it SHOWS this message to us with a bang in its final episode while ""Battlestar Galactica"" verbally beats us over the head with it)...the messages generally resonate and are interesting.(4) The actors.  By and large, pretty darn good!(5) The special effects.  Great!  (Any effects that I don't ""notice"" get an ""A"" in my book!)(6) Women get to be just as strong and just as weak as men.(7) The music.  Very, very appropriate.(8) Check out many of the 5-star reviews on amazon.  I got a little tired by the end here, but this is a thrilling show to watch!  If you feel like you could handle the aforementioned ""cons"", then a Galacticathon will be incredibly enjoyable for you!"	5.0	Addictive in spite of flaws	2007-02-07	7	3	4
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AT65B83HHKX6Q	"Longrifle ""NOLA Lives!"""	I ordered this set in February ('08) and when I received it I examined it for the problems that other reviewers have posted. So far, I have found none. The discs are in excellent condition physically (i.e. no scratches) and there is no audio/video mismatch on any of the discs. The case it came in is average and I can see why the discs could become loose within and get scratched. The same problem that the first batch of Halo 3 Limited Edition discs had wherein they became loose and scratched in the case-the result of poor packaging design. However, the BSG discs were securely affixed to the packaging, so I can only conclude that the quality control problems that the other reviewers alluded to have been fixed. Also, I did not see a difference between the miniseries and season one discs as far as visual quality. I am using an LCD, HDMI connection and my HD-DVD player is outputting at 1080i, LCD's native resolution is 768. Overall I am very pleased by my purchase and highly recommend to anyone looking to buy.	5.0	Quality Control Problems Fixed?	2008-03-22	1	1	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1Q95KSS5ASCOO	"Lou Cypher ""Lucifer"""	I don't know where people get off comparing Battlestar Galactica to the events of septembre 11th... This show is science fiction not science fact. If we compare both of them for a second... Over 6000 people died on 9/11 from two aircrafts crashing into the world trade center. In the series, 12 planets are destroyed by a combined nuclear assault resulting in a death toll of billions upon billions practically annihilating an entire human race. There is no comparison to be made. Plus the fact that this story originally started in the late 70's by Glen A. Larson meens that it wasn't thought up just recently in the wake of 9/11. Leave it to Americans to think that every disaster movie or TV series from now on will be influenced in some way by one of their most tragic moments in history. Don't get me wrong, I don't condone the events of 9/11, but it's things like this that really show off America's arrogance in thinking that they are the only one's who suffer in the world... Millions of people die of famine and diesase every day. Star Trek Enterprise on the other hand... Now there's a series that capitalized on 9/11. Six million people die from a Xindi attack this resembles a lot more the six thousand by terrorists... No wonder the series was canceled.I love Battlestar Galactica, old and new, and will continue to watch every episode until it ends. Wich is more than I can say for Star Trek or Star Wars. The stories are great, the action is greater. My only regret is they should have more cameos from actors of the original series.	4.0	Comparing BG to 9/11? What's up with that?	2005-09-04	33	1	32

It took me about 5 episodes before I was hooked, but it sucked me in.  The great thing about this show is I really couldn't predict what was going to happen.  The only down sides to the show: it's extremely dark; it takes on a wide range of political and social issues head-on; bullying, racism; healthcare, pro-life, healthcare, democracy, sexism, ect.  It's almost too heavy at some points where you come to resent the writers for subjecting you to so many political/social commentaries.  Still, the show wraps up nicely, and leaves only a few questions.  Really hand it to the producers; 4 seasons was just right.  It's great to see a tv series get it right; after a show like ""Firefly"" met early demise and you have so many terrible reality shows.  This is everything a great tv show should be; great acting, writing, and action.  Going to watch some of the spin-offs."	5.0	Awesome show	2013-03-02	0	0	0

It's always nice to come home to my family, unwind, and enjoy a nice Science Fiction escape every so often. I can't do that with this series. I see from this board that fans of the new series often consider fun shows like the original BSG to be ""garbage"" and those who don't like the new version to be ""live in their parent's basement types"". That simply isn't true. I embrace reality. I'm a fan of many older TV programs and do not consider them garbage. I also like newer TV series although this isn't one them. Not everybody considers this to be ""a treat"". Not liking this new BSG doesn't indicate that a person doesn't live in the real world. They could very well live in the real world and that's why they like entertainment they can escape and unwind with at times. I sure do. New BSG isn't that kind of program. The September 11th elements of this series are bad enough, but that's not the end of it.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2	Lovblad	For people of my age, Battlestar Galactica had quite a  bad reputation of a cheaply produced TV series and movie from quite a while ago. Therefore I was not quite sure what to think about this before I got it. The surprise is a big one indeed. This is an excellent Sci-Fi series. The acting is really surprisingly good as are the rest of the production vales such as the effects and directing. All this will be explained better in other reviews.

That DVD (it turned out to be two DVDs because one of the DVDs was so poorly done that they forgot to put anything on side B!) was a mess and the rabid fans still gave it 5 stars! Forget what you've heard about Trekies being fanatics because rabid BSG fans are an even bigger bunch of mindless followers who will buy anything! It's one thing to like a TV show, but get some perspective people! This product is far from the best DVD set around. It's poorly done.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3VQNCZ7AT269V	Luke	"Captain Justice has pointed out that this is not the shoddy first season set Universal released through Best Buy. Fair enough, but people still have a right to be unhappy with the crummy way this series has been brought to DVD so far. The driven crazy Captain complains about such criticisms, but such complaints are justified when Universal couldn't even label the damn DVD included with the blank B sided mini series DVD which wasn't supposed to be blank! You could make a better product at home! Talk about a buzzkill! It was just an attempt at making quick cash off of the fans with no concern for quality! Let's stop covering their butts for ripping us off. Not all fans will buy anything no matter what. Some of us want a decent product for our cash. The good Captain is free to ""chill"" while forking over the cash, but some people don't like getting shoddy products in return for their money. It's true that I was reviewing the shoddy previous first season set in my other review. I stand corrected, but the 5 star reviewers on here haven't seen it either. I'll play along and give it a 2 since we are all just guessing at how the quality will be. I'll give it a higher rating if it turns out to be better quality than the previous Battlestar DVDs. Maybe Universal will at last give us a decent product now that they have sold us some pretty sad DVDs a couple of times already."	2.0	* I stand corrected *	2005-08-16	30	8	22
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2JIEQ4SJQ29UH	L. Walker	This is the first sci-fi series I have ever enjoyed.  This is also the first drama series I have ever enjoyed.  It's likely the reason this is the first sci-fi I have enjoyed might be due to the fact that there simply aren't many sci-fi shows on television, and therefore even less quality sci-fi.  However, there is no shortage of drama series on television today, so that this show could somehow catch my eye where all others failed is testament to its greatness.The bottomline is that this show will get you involved.  It's greatest strength is its characters, and from that everything simply flourishes.  Everything is perfect.  Camera work, transistions, acting, you name it and I can't find fault with it.  Perhaps most impressive is that the creators of the show actually took the time to make sure when they spout of a scientific explanation of something, it is viable.  Rarely do you see a show offer a legitimate explanation for something, even (or perhaps especially) in shows that aren't science fiction.  It adds a sense of realism that enhances your connection with the characters.  The show is entirely believable, the reactions and interactions all emotionally involving, and unlike many other shows today the episodes are not formulaic or repetitive.My only concern is that they fall into the pitfall that plagues many writers (both novel and broadcast alike) today: being unable to know when to stop the series.  Allowing something to go too far only tarnishes the earlier successes, and I hope this fate does not befall Battlestar Galactica.Regardless, this is the best television series that is out right now.  To be honest, I don't expect to see another show of this caliber for another decade.	5.0	Simply the best television series I have witnessed	2006-07-19	7	4	3

Not preachy, apolitical, and not afraid to delve deeply into all human relationships (both personal and institutional), it breaks all stereotypes - this show is a gem in the rough of today's TV wasteland.It's attention to dramatic action and its penchant for piercing social commentary should not be lost in its science fiction roots. If this show were part of any other genre - crime drama, sitcom, miniseries - both Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonell would have surely been nominated for Emmys, along with the writers and cinematographers.I hope this series is long lived.

I ignored this series on the SCIFI channel (apparently). I'm not a follower of serialized television, totally skipped the XFILES and other weekly shows.So on a total whim I picked this up. I have just finished the last episode of season one. I ordered Season 2.0 once I was halfway through disc 2.This is not your parents ""Galactica"". The acting (across the board) is top notch, the characters have depth, the stories and plot lines are great, the effects are fabulous.

The actors are a mix of veteran greats and I recognize many of the younger ones in other works to (e.g. Kate Sackhoff is now in Longmire).  All that said, you will either love it or hate it.  It doesn't seem to command the respect of Star Wars or Star Trek but I'll stack it up against any of the Sci-Fi TV series.  Be sure and watch the 3 hour intro before you dive into the season series.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A39FOMALD6K6Q5	Mark J. Werner	Science-fiction series of all time, that is.The original Galactica, one with Lorne Green, was a joke.  Silly pap of a level with Lost In Space.  This &#34;re-imagining&#34; got it right.The thing that impressed me immediately was that someone in the writing team understood the military mind...Finally.So many series that have a military element simply do not get it.  These folks did.Secondly, the interaction between the military and the civilian authorities.  The interplay between Adama and &#34;Madame President&#34; was simply terrific.Then, giving Cylons not only human form but a backstory and a culture and even a religion....Brilliant.  The original Cylons were laughable chrome robots who appeared to exist only to hate humanity.There are some sci-fi fans who were upset at the inclusion of religion and mystical elements.  But (and I'm writing as a non-believer...) religion and superstition both are part and parcel of the human condition.If you somehow managed to miss this one...

Doesn't the series have a wardrobe budget? Even the original series had its own futuristic clothing.The original Battlestar Galactica series used the same combat footage over and over again to save money. But, at least we saw real looking robots. This series is so cheap, that they decided to make the Cylons ""act and look exactly like humans"" to save a little money. What a shame! The whole idea of the series was ""people against robots"". What ever happened to that original concept for the series?What is with the blond-haired Cylon bimbo? Can't they sell the series on the story itself? Do they really need sex to get me to watch? I find her character very irritating and unnecessary.My list of complaints goes on, but I'll save you the reading. Watch the series yourself. It would be worth a good laugh if it were not so boring and shallow.This new series is simply a soap opera with a few special effects and the Battlestar Galactica name thrown in for name recognition. It is poorly done and an insult to the original Battlestar Galactica series for which it is named. If this is an example of the sci-fi to come, its time to unplug the cable and throw away the TV.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1ZHG8SSIWUUEW	"Martha W ""Expatuk"""	"I rated this series 5*s on Netflix, and was really looking forward to seeing it in the true splendor of HD on my 71"" Samsung DLP from a Tosh A30 over HDMI. This review is not about the BSG content, but about the HD boxed set.What is wrong ? Well, really - everything !1 - It's not a ""boxed set"". There is no box. The packaging is 6 discs attached to a flimsy fold-out card holder that fits inside a pathetically flimsy acetate sleave. If I had seen this in a store I would not have bought it.2 - Disks are all scratched. Yes, every one of them. Perhaps not scratched exactly - it looks rather as if the discs could have been stressed in some way, so that the surface is fractured. It seems likely that the hopelessly inadequate packaging allowed the discs to be stressed in transit. Most of them were partially playable, but 2 would not even load.3 - Awful mastering. The image quality was comparable with a poorer than average DVD. I just finished watching all 3 seasons of Lost on regaular DVD through the same equipment, and the image quality was FAR superior to the image quality on this set (to be fair, the mastering on Lost is excellent). Now, it is true that a 71"" DLP will expose even small flaws, but I watch a lot of regular DVDs on this setup, including some fairly old ones, and there are few that look worse than this BSG set. The blacks are very poorly rendered, with lots of speckles of white, and all of the dark backgrounds are poorly reproduced. On top of that, I see a lot of compression artifacts - about the same as when watching from my ReplayTV through S-Video.I want my money back. This product is simply not of merchantable quality. Even if the physical issues were reslved (scatched discs, non-box packaging) the video quality is so poor that to sell this material as ""HD"" is simply dishonest.UPDATEWell, they wouldn't give me my money back, but I got a replacement set. This time only 3 of the discs had the scratches, and they were all playable. These more minor scratches seem to manifest themselves as snow in some scenes, and some minor skipping and audio sync problems. The audio sync was resolved by pausing and restarting. Still not acceptable, but it did allow me to see more of the main season (as opposed to the miniseries). The Quality on the season varies from better than the miniseries to much better. The video quality in the scenes on the surface of Cobol, and some of the outdoor material of Boomer and Helo on Caprica, and on Clound 9 is truely eye-popping. Elsewhere there is plenty of good video quality, but also a lot of very mediocre footage as well. But this just makes the quality of the rest of the material all the more disappointing.Even with a set of perfectly unscrated discs I could not rate this above 3 stars - which is a real shame given how good it COULD have been. I will be returning this set to see if I can finally get an unscratched set."	1.0	Fantastic Series, Awful HD-DVD Set	2008-01-06	15	9	6

I was never a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica, but it was fun escapism. I'm more of a fan of original Trek, TNG, Star Gate, Farscape, and Firelfy. New Galactica is more of a sci fi series for those who don't like sci fi. It's more of a ""realistic"" drama. There will be no exploration of various different alien worlds and cultures.

My real goal here is to add another voice to the growing chorus of people heartbroken by this travesty in the (likely deluded) hope that Universal issues a recall and maybe does it right next time.

But, I am so sick and tired of Number Six appearing to Baltar over and over and over again in episode after episode.  I can't stand it.  It's irritating.  The tense music they play again and again in the background when she appears to him is irritating.  His stammering, sweaty, uneasy response to her is irritating.  Her dragging her finger across his face, lips, and ear in scene after scene is irritating.  For God's sake...how many more times are they going to bring the pace of the show to a crawl so they can have yet another Number Six/Baltar scene that doesn't really add much anyways?Furthermore, I hate the Starbuck character.  I absolutely hate the fact that they re-cast a favorite old character as a woman (liberal/feminist Hollywood social engineering).  Not only does it bother me that they re-cast the character as a woman...they had to pick an irritating actress with a bunch of irritating characteristics.  Hollywood...please...spare us these ""tough woman"" characters who can throw a punch.  It's soooooooooooo warn out.  Hey, if you want to have strong female characters that's cool.  Just don't wreck a favorite old character that we all liked when we were younger.  It undermines interest and willingness to spend money for the product.  The same goes for the Boomer character.Finally, they could have spent just a bit more money on the urban sets that are supposedly on the surface of some distant planet.  They look almost exactly like the one in the small town where I live.  Part of the reason for watching a science fiction series is to see unusual settings.  Filming the urban or suburban planetary surface scenes in Earthly neighborhoods with little to no enhancement looks extremely cheap...not to mention unconvincing.I'm probably being too harsh though.  There is much to like about the series.  Edward-James Olmos is great...as always.  Mary McDonnell does a good job of portraying a beleaguered president.  The space ships, space travel, and space battles are convincing and well done.  The metal Cylons are cool.  The idea of having a version of the Cylons look and act like humans is a clever and highly useful story element.  The soundtrack is really good (except for the Number Six/Baltar scenes).  There is a very despairing undertone to the movie that serves its ""nearly the end of the line for humanity"" theme very well.  Last, and probably most importantly, the episode stories are pretty good.I will watch the rest of Season One.  I'm not sure if I want to spend money on Seasons 2.0 and 2.5 though.  There is much to like in the series but there are too many highly irritating elements."	3.0	Half way through Season One...mixed feelings...	2006-12-18	22	4	18

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A59L64XAOCZ3D	Matthew Pinson	"The original Battlestar Galactica, the antiquated sachrin that it is, was at the time the most expensive tv show ever produced. And what did all that money produce, exactly? A show that lasted slightly under a year and somehow developed a literally suicidal cult following. As you can see, reader, I'm not big on traditional sci-fi (personally, I wish Isacc Asimov was never born). When I first sat down to watch the mini-series of the ""reimagined"" BSG, I was skeptical: I thought it would be all shakey camera's and pretty girls. Well, there are shakey cameras and VERY pretty girls, but it is much more than that.Not since Buffy the Vampire Slayer has a TV show taken such controversial leaps and bounds in the field of science fiction-fantasy and come out on top. Unlike Buffy, however, everybody on the show are adults, with real grounded issues in a very hostile and dangerous universe. The mini-series tells the essential backstory for the series: the humans created the robot race known as the Cylons, the Cylons rebelled and killed them all. It would seem simple as that right? Evil robots kill people and the heroic surviors fight back. Not quite. The idea of good and evil is blurred, especially when it's revealed that the Cylons can now look human. Tricia Helfter plays one of the human-looking Cylons who goes by the name Number Six. Six is a supervixen robot who haunts the thoughts of supergenius human Gaius Baltar, played with crazy wit by James Callis. Edward James Olomos, who usually occupies the role of the wise Chicano, this time occupies the role of the stodgy Commander Adama, orignally played by Lorne Greene. The biggest change however, is Starbuck: no longer played by Dirk Benedict, but by Katee Sackhoff. Whaaa?! A woman as Starbuck?! That's right guy who still wears old con t-shirts, the new show not only reimagines the plot but also the characters, and the balliest move of all was making Starbuck a woman. Sackhoff if the best actor of the bunch and the suprising ingenue of the show.Love or hate the original, the new BSG is much better, even without the cheesey '70's style space-capes.

Rather, it is a well-written, intense rethinking of the Galactica story, along with interesting characters with slowly revealed back-stories, and Cylons that are not slow-moving drones.

I shouldn't have waited, this show is really good.  The tone has changed with the times, but the miniseries pilot has several nice nods to the original series.Yes, Starbuck is a women this time, and while no one will ever replace Dirk Benedick; Katee Sackhoff makes the role her own and if you give her a chance, you'll really like her.  All the actors do a fine job, Edward James Olmos and Mary McDowell always deliver, but a great standout in a smaller role is Aaron Douglas as Chief Tyrol.A Warning for parents, there is a pretty high level of sexuality and violence, which pretty much goes with the territory with Sci-Fi these days.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AWARU654P7SWL	M. Burnett	"Potential, but dissapointing.  Also, pervasive, random sex.Well I waded through all 6 seasons (2.5 + 4.5 make six), and if they cut out all the sex you would have to remove an entire season.The show is composed of episodes that move the plot forward and are very good, and episodes that I call ""soap opera"" episodes that go and don't contribute anything.  If you also took out all of the soap opera episodes, you would have only have one season left.The exodus from New Caprica (season 2.5 I think) was fantastic...probably the best episode of the series.The end of the last season (4.5) was a huge disappointment.  Some of the questions they left unanswered which is fine, but the questions they did answer, which they had been building towards the entire show, where such a huge disappointment, one being the opera house and the dream of Rosalyn, Caprica 6 and Athena.  The other was Starbuck, somehow she was the Harbinger of Death, and the end-result of the song she heard/felt as a child was disappointing.It seemed the entire point of the show was to make it as morally grey as possible.  All of the characters were extremely inconsistent.  For instance the President has a citizen tortured, and then afterwards says to the effect ""of course we're going to give him a fair trial.""  It was then I realized that this show was written during G.W. Bush's first term in office and the president apparently mirrors him and Admiral Adama mirrors Rumsfeld who answers valid press questions with ""I don't answer hypotheticals.""  The exception is that the show tries unsuccessfully to make them seem like good people at heart instead of the evil conspirators bent on implementing a New World Order.  The show takes good characters and has them make incredibly bad decisions and bad people and try to make them seem good, the characters are extremely inconsistent.  An oft heard line in the first couple of seasons was ""That's a line I can't cross.""  Well, those lines they refused to cross were always moving.The one exception was HELO, but he was such a bad actor (or shallow character) that you don't really care about him.The show tried hard to be more like our current society, abandoning the laser guns for 9mm rounds.  Freedom was a privilege instead of a right.  They sword an oath to defend the Articles of Colonization (Constitution), but defacto Marital Law was in effect.  If you produced and didn't exercise your right to speak freely in a way the president or Admiral didn't like then you were ""free"".  Otherwise you risked being boarded and shot by the military.  One example was the Tillium ship.  They pretended to allow them freedom, however once the ship decided to leave the fleet the sent the marines after them and commandeered the ship.  If they wanted to take the morally conscionable path, and since this ship was so critical to the rest of the fleet, they should have exercised eminent domain and given them a fair market value for what the fleet ""public"" needed.  What exacerbated this was the military was not directed by civilians.  Often you would hear Adama take random questions and declare ""It's a military decision.""Another example the grey-and-freedom issue was the mutiny/rebellion of Gaeta and Zarek.  What started out as a legitimate right of the people to rebel and assert their natural rights as human beings when their freedom was being trampled on by the arbitrary decisions of tyrants turned very sour.  Both Gaeta and Zarek tainted what they did with poor choices.  The show glorified Adama as this god-like figure who all good people hallowed as The Old Man.The military in general was glorified as it is in our day.  One member snuck into the military, did a great job, and when her history was found out, Starbuck excoriated her for trying to steal her way into the company of ""good people.""  My wife and laughed out loud, and for a long time this was a funny joke between us.  These ""good people"" were portrayed on-screen as the dregs of humanity.  Yes they defended the fleet against the Cylons, but as Adama queried in the first season: ""Is what we're fighting for worth saving?""  You could ask the same of our society while we pretend to fight for ""freedom"".The question of religion is always there, and they never completely answer the question as to whether it is real in this fictional world or not, but it is clear that the writers are atheistic.  They portray religion as something vain people spout to gain a following, and of course some are ""duped"" and believe they are really following ""God's Plan.""They used the word ""frack"" all of the time instead of the real f-word.  At first it was comical, until they used it so much and just like usage of the real f-word that it became disgusting itself.In the end I watched every episode to find out what the answers to the questions were, and I was disappointed."	3.0	Potential, but dissapointing.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A34K3THSX5XNLQ	"M. davis ""alien reader"""	battlestar galactica is probably the best of its kind, a once in a lifetime event that changed the face of television for all time.  Thats why I find it so sad that video on demand for this is only available for a handful of portable video players.  I am one of a legion of Motorola DROID owners who are hungering for video content and will NOT be purchasing it from amazon because of an extreme lack of vision on their part.  The DROID is arguably the best machine to take advantage of this service and yet amazon chose instead a number of small-screen nokias and the worst reviewed, most expensive players out there.  I bought my DROID from amazon, too and their policy should be: sell a phone, sell some video.  how 'bout it amazon, sell me some video or jus' fuhget about it!	1.0	format update	2010-04-06	18	0	18
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AQEYNKSMDESO7	M. De Taeye	"Actually, it's not per se a sci-fi series but a great drama set in space.The drama involves a ""handful"" (about 50,000) of humans surviving the attack and extermination by Cylons, intelligent ""chrome toasters"", created by the same humans. The Cylons have evolved, a lot of them now look like humans and they have infiltrated the fleet of surviving ships...What follows is a long confrontation between the humans and their creations, from the battlefield to the bedroom, and the consequent dramatic outcomes are endless and fascinating. Meanwhile, the human race is fighting for its survival and against its eradication, in search of an elusive new world to reestablish itself. A new world called Earth...After the first season, you are entitled to believe that the following seasons will be about the ""getting there"" - if ""there"" actually exists - and many more confrontations between man and robot. There's also the complex road to follow to reorganize society as it were, with politics and its ugliness, command and rebellions. Everything and everybody clashes at some point, it's inevitable.The writing of this show is smart and mature (by the way, this is not a family show), and so is the vast cast, excellent from top to bottom.As a woman, I particularly appreciate the ""bimbo-free"" environment. Even Number 6, the ""most beautiful woman in the universe"" and a highly sexual being, is far from being a ""blonde"". The sense of gender equality is real and gives some serious food for thought. The most important character to my opinion is the misbehaved pilot Kara Thrace, a.k.a. Starbuck, who smokes cigars and throws some serious punches. She is tough and promiscuous, and men can't resist her. Hard not to love!Years after it came out on TV, and months after the whole series ended, I decided to investigate what Battlestar was about after I read an article somewhere about how important this series is for the genre. It definitely brings it to the ""serious and complex"" categorie, away from air shows with guys in silly outfits and ridiculous looking aliens. The complex plot and the human drama is appealing to any viewer, even those outside the usual fanclub of the genre.Special mentions also have to be given to the great soundtrack/score, and the overall style and cinematography.A must see!"	5.0	to become a classic sci-fi series	2010-04-14	3	3	0

Interesting characters with real flaws. You don't know who to trust - or who will change ""sides"" and start to behave in a different way.The plot lines are extremely well played and thought out. The acting is great. A few scenes even brought tears to my eyes, especially those between Lee ""Apollo"" and his father Adama.

I do not agree with those that say all naysayers are bitter fans of the original. Hardly. I tried to like it and I keep an eye on it. It's fine for some. Not what I like. I'd prefer something more upbeat that moves along.I'm not 'searching for a reason' to dislike this. I know exactly why it's not for me. I also don't watch 'lost' and don't just follow the critics. I keep an eye on glactica but it doesn't hold my attention. It doesn't make me want to tune in each week.I recently caught some of sg-1 for the first time. I like it a lot.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"Usually I am not a fan of science fiction, but I have to admit that I really like ""Battlestar Galactica."" This series is very character-driven...it's a drama that just happens to be set in space. The premise of the series is that robotic creatures called Cylons (which were created by humans) have rebelled and now control a large portion of the 12 colonies. President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) and Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos) gather up the remains of the human population and embark on a quest to find the mythical 13th colony, Earth. However, the Cylons are more advanced than anyone on Galactica ever thought possible, and the members of the fleet must overcome one obstacle after another in their struggle to survive.This DVD set contains the 13 episodes from the first season of the series, along with the three-hour miniseries that preceded it. The one thing I don't like about the DVDs (and the show in general) is that the intro to each episode shows a reel of scenes from the show you're getting ready to watch...if you're like me and try to avoid spoilers whenever possible, you'll want to avert your eyes during the opening credits: otherwise most of the episode will be given away. However, that's the only complaint I have. The cast is superb, the special effects are awesome, and the storyline is riveting.

The only thing that bothers me a little bit is the following: it must be really hard to command Galactica... WHy?Simple: because Galactica is a military installation where almost EVERYBODY, from the lowest soldier or corporal, to the highest ranking officers, disobey orders at will, point guns at their superiors, argue with them in front of lower ranking personnel. all that when they simply think there is a better option to the order they received.

The first season is so good, you might think it could never maintain or get better... but it does.As far as this specific set;  It includes the mini-series pilot, saving you the trouble and money of tracking it down alone.  The menus include episode descriptions and original air dates.  Each episode is complete, including the ""previously on..."" bits  (helpful if you go through the season slowly).  The extras are fairly standard, but there's more than most first season sets usually get (in my experience).  Enough to satisfy, especially since it's the show that really counts here.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A334DYKDLA9K8L	"M. G.

But that's a different story.Anyway, I watched as they reshowed the mini before the actual series started and was glad I did. It follows much the same template that the old show did but without the cheese. No Casino planet or no robot dogs yet you get some really great writing and characters all done in Dramatic fashion, Character conflictand some intense conlict. What else could you want from a Drama/Sci Fi show.This show is everything that Star Trek Voyager wasn't. What the two share are people (and a crew) isolated and lost (with rations) looking for Earth but on this show the characters are flawed and therefore interesting (unlike Voyager) and they change and evolve.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's almost too dark. Sure most of mankind has been destroyed but you need some light moments occasionally; something I think they are taking care of in Season 2 with the dialogue. Also the Number 6 Balta Scenes are very repetitive. Unfortunately they continue in Season 2.If you haven't converted yet, this boxset is a good reason	4.0	It won me over...	2005-08-03	31	24	7

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"When the Sci-Fi Channel first announced back in 2003 that it was producing a miniseries version of the original 1978 TV series ""Battlestar Galactica"", I had a lot of doubts about how successful it would be because two of the former main characters were being turned from men into women and because the some of the Cylons were going to appear human.  When I first watched the miniseries back in 2003, my doubts were quickly washed away as the miniseries proved to be compelling, engaging, extremely realistic, emotional, well-acted and had superb special effects.  Due to the huge success of the miniseries, the Sci-Fi Channel decided to produce a TV series based upon its 2003 miniseries.  The first season of the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series aired in 2004 and showed itself to be just as exciting and well made as the miniseries.The primary characters in the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" are Commander William ""Husker"" Adama (Edward James Olmos), President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace (Katee Sackhoff), Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber), Doctor Gaius Baltar (James Callis), Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park), the Cylon known as Number Six (Tricia Helfer), Col. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) and Lt. Karl 'Helo' Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett).  Other characters include Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch, who played Apollo in the original 1978 ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series), Chief Petty Officer Tyrol, Crashdown (Sam Witwer) and Crewman Specialist Cally (Nicki Clyne).The 13 episodes of the first season are as follows:1. ""33"". Once every 33 minutes, the fleeing human fleet is repeatedly attacked by Cylons, forcing it to repeatedly jump to new locations to avoid the attacks; but how are the Cylons always finding them?  In the meantime, Helo is still alive on Caprica, and so is a Boomer.2. ""Water"". Sabotage on Galactica causes it to lose a large amount of its water supply and Boomer suspects that she might have committed the act.3. ""Bastille Day"". Richard Hatch makes his first appearance as the prisoner Tom Zarek, who takes members of Galactica's crew hostage.4. ""Act of Contrition"". An accident aboard Galactica forces inexperienced pilots into learning to fly Vipers while Starbuck confronts her memories surrounding the death of Apollo's brother Zak.  Starbuck later crashes on a planet after fighting a Cylon fighter.5. ""You Can't Go Home Again"". Having survived the crash (in the previous episode), Starbuck finds the crashed Cylon fighter and decides to use it as a means to escape the uninhabited planet.  Neither Adama nor Apollo want to give up their search for Starbuck.6. ""Litmus"". An attack upon Galactica by a human-looking Cylon prompts a tribunal with Boomer & Tyrol at the center of the controversy until Adama is forced to testify.7. ""Six Degrees of Separation"". Number Six appears on Galactica as someone else and accuses Baltar of being a traitor.8. ""Flesh and Bone"". Starbuck interrogates a discovered human-looking Cylon at great psychological cost to herself and President Roslin.  The Boomer on Caprica receives uncomfortable orders for being with Helo.9. ""Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down"". Adama has prepared a surprise for Col. Tigh: his wife, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), has been discovered among the refugees in the fleet.10. ""The Hand of God"". While Galactica launches a daring attack on a Cylon base for fuel, President Roslin begins to have hallucinations that are perceived as prophetic.11. ""Colonial Day"". Tom Zarek makes his grab for political power upon the desires of the Quorum to elect a Vice President.12. ""Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part 1"". When Galactica discovers Kobol (thanks to Boomer), President Roslin asks Starbuck to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo from Caprica while Boomer attempts suicide. On Caprica, Helo doesn't know what to do with Boomer, who is pregnant with his child. A Galactica shuttle crash-lands on Kobol with Tyrol, Baltar and Crashdown.13. ""Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part 2"". Adama arrests President Roslin as a traitor for having convinced Starbuck to fly to Caprica, but after Boomer returns triumphant after destroying a Cylon Basestar over Kobol, a frightening and unexpected event will leave the audience in suspense until the start of the second season.  Also, Number Six reveals a secret to Baltar on Kobol and Starbuck has a fight with another Number Six on Caprica, where she also meets Helo and the other Boomer.Overall, for being one of the best sci-fi TV programs produced in a long time, I rate the first season of the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone."	5.0	An Amazing & Critically-Acclaimed Sci-Fi TV Series	2005-08-20	36	31	5

I thought they might just be visual flaws that didn't translate into a performance problem, being ever hopeful, but when I reached disk two the stuttering and glitching started.  What I saw on disk one looked good, not overwhelming, but good.  However, there seems to have been a massive failure in quality control for these disks to have all ended up like this.  The packaging of the box and an entire bad run of disks suggest Universal was doing some serious cost cutting here, and it seems to have put companies like Amazon into the expensive position of replacing the disks over and over or simply returning people's money.  Why not do a recall and stop selling these until they can assure us the product is 100 percent?

I was very surprised at the thought and quality that had gone into remaking what was to begin with a campy and comically bad television show.I have since been on a campaign to spread the word; Battlestar Galactica was a show worth watching. The first season remains in my opinion the best, though there have been many good episodes in seasons 2 and 3. Unfortunately the word hasn't spread far enough, as SciFi channel has only ordered 14 episodes for season 4, and even worse, has put off its airing until January of 2008.My recommendation?

It was overlooked by many only because it was on an obscure cable channel. However, the staff of TV Without Pity, a prominent website for critique and analysis of TV shows, recently named it the best drama of 2004-2005, along with one other show (Deadwood).Scifi usually leaves me cold but I love Battlestar Galactica. BG has a lot of emotion and personal drama. The relationships are refreshing, well-developed, and interesting. They give a wonderful emotional underpinning to all the events that unfold.This series is a little bit Alias (intrigue, suspense, strong female characters, importance of family and love, overarching plot), a little bit West Wing (the politics), Star Wars (dogfights in space), and in the beginning of the second season even Band of Brothers.I love that there are almost as many female characters as male on this show, they have a variety of roles, and none of them are pushovers. The two that stand out most are President Roslin who is strong and decisive but also warm and compassionate; and Starbuck who is the best pilot in the fleet.Anyone looking for a show with a lot of action, suspense, and emotion supported by excellent writing and acting should check out Battlestar Galactica.	5.0	Best new show of last season	2005-08-25	42	38	4

It was compelling enough to me that I plowed through the entire season in about 5 days.One word of advice would be to make sure and watch the &#34;prequel&#34; as otherwise you will miss part of the story.Also.. Having watched the original series way back in the day I was pleasantly surprised by the use of the actor who originally played the role of Apollo.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3GCO0KS64IZGF	Milhouse	"Battlestar Galactica appeared on Sci-fi channel in 2005. Revitalizing the old television series the new Battlestar Galactica has brought the series to new heights. Starting as a mini series on Sci-fi Channel in 2004 it grew from there to an impressive new sci-fi thriller; it became one of Sci-fi channels best original television series. With a cast including Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell the series has really begun to soar.When the four hour mini series appeared, it came with spectacular special effects that have not disappointed in the first two seasons. Including some amazing aerial shots from space looking on the ship as it is firing it massive guns during fights with cylon base stars, in episodes like the mini series, ""33,"" and ""Resurrection Ship."" Also the intense scenes in which the human Vipers are fighting the cylon raiders create a visual wonder that you would not expect on a television series, but instead on the movie screen. However, when you do have such good special effects you have to sacrifice something else. Increasingly evident are shots that first appeared in the mini series arising in the first few seasons. Including a scene in which the Vipers are landing that has been shown at least five times.Along with the outstanding special effects, the show brings in a thrilling plot that easily captivates the audience. With such twists as the cylons being able to clone human forms into twelve different models, and even having the only cylon expert talking to a cylon-human that really isn't there. The plot takes the viewer along for a ride as we start to see the struggle between the military and civilian leadership in a fleet of fifty-thousand people. This becomes evident in episodes like ""You Can't Go Home Again,"" and ""Litmus."" Even with such an outstanding plot there are many flaws; the show has already told us the ending that will govern where it goes from here; it has also been made so that you can't bring in new cast members unless they significantly change the plot. Also, it has become increasingly dark as the crew aboard Galactica has begun to feel the strain of not having any rest and is beginning to believe that life might not be worth living, as shown in episodes like ""33,"" ""Pegasus,"" and ""Resurrection Ship.""Battlestar Galactica is off to a great start and will continue to prosper as a great sci-fi thriller. With two seasons under its belt we have seen many plot twists and stunning visual effects. However, it has left it self dry on new cast members and won't easily be able to replace a prominent character without significantly altering the storyline. Even with these few hurdles I will still continue sitting down on Friday nights and get pulled straight into a galaxy far away from home and watch as people try to survive and live a normal life at the same time."	4.0	Good Sci-fi series	2006-02-07	16	14	2

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3HNSM3PLTBMPD	M. J. Keel	"I review books, but I had to make an exception for this.What if there were thirteen ""colonies"" of humans on thirteen diffferent planets and all could trace their origins to one homeworld?  What if twelve of those planets stayed in contact to form a federation of planets united under one government and one culture?  What if those twelve planets created robots to make their lives easier only to have those robots rebel and attempt to exterminate the human race?  What if the survivors of the twelve colonies fled in search of the thirteenth colony with thier rebellious creations pursuing them along the way?  What if the lost colony was Earth?  This is the premise of the all new Battlestar Galatica.I am hooked on and captivated by Battlestar Galactica.  It has great action sequences, complex and intersting characters, humor, love, inventive sets, amazingly realistic effects, plot twists galore, ethical dillemas, and it is so compelling that I have a hard time stopping after one or even two episodes.  I have laughed, been angry, and nearly cried as I watched the ordeal of the survivors of humanity as they flee the cylons and fight for their lives trying to live as normal a life as possible along the way.If you are a hard core fan of the original series be ready for something completely different; unrecognizable.  If you can get past that you are in for a ""fracking"" good time.  Sci-fi fans will love this show, but even those who are more into shows like Law and Order and CSI will love this one.

Moscheck ""mikemos"""	At first I was amazed at all of the bad reviews for BSG but then I realized there has to be a fan base for Stargate type SciFi and therefore bad taste is rampant. Then after reading I became surprised at the overwhelming amount of good reviews. It's good to see this series getting the recognition it deserves. BSG is one of the smartest, grittiest and engrossing series on TV these days.I was a fan of the original series when I was a kid too but when I watch it today I can tell it was written for kids. As I remember there were 2 incarnations of the original series; the 1st being pretty good and the 2nd being space disco.If you go by science alone the new series is great. The sound in space is not completely gone :( but it is muffled simulating the inside of a cockpit. They don't use lasers which would be a poor weapon. The robots can actually move instead of shuffle and they don't have the intelligence of a poodle.But the most successful rewrite is Baltar. The original series never explains why a person would betray the human race. It would have to be a strong motive. The revamped Baltar is believable, if a bit pathetic, and STARBUCK IS A GIRL!!. Who cares? She's a great character.This is a great show. Get over your selective childhood memories. The original was endearing but hokey. The new show stands on its own.	5.0	Amazed at good and bad reviews	2006-01-08	13	11	2

Season 1 starts with HD disks 3, 4.  Both these disks were missing what seemed to be a preceeding episode, since the teaser ""previously on ......"" showed scenes and story lines that had not appeared on the previous disk.  I got frustrated and went to the SD version, and yes, a previous episode was indeed missing from disks 3,4.  Including what was considered the best episode of season 1 were Starbuck punched out of her viper during it's re-entry breakup. I don't know if only my set was bad, or all of them are short episodes.  With HD dead, no way to fix it now.  Since it was an intermediate episode between disks 2-3 and 3-4, one might conclude that it was intentional to reduce the number of HD disks required for the season. Who knows, but I just gave up on the HD version entirely.  Since the series (excluding mini-series) are shot in HD, maybe the later seasons will be released blu-ray.

Let me say something, here and now, aside from the initial homages to the original show, the retelling of Battlestar Galactica bears no resemblance to the original short-lived series.  Gone are Lorne Greene and Dirk Benidict.  Richard Hatch, is, strangely, still here.A friend of mine kept badgering me to see this show.  ""Dude, you gotta check out the new Battlestar Galactica!"" he kept saying.  Sure, I'll get around to it, I kept saying.  Was I ready for the retooled version of some ancient show that I could barely remember?  That kinda made me drag my feet a little.  So, my birthday rolls around and my wife asks me is there any DVDs the kids can get me and I say, oh yeah, Battlestar Galactica...I was not ready for what awaited me.Going into the first season with the old show still looming in the back of my mind, those thoughts were quickly evaporated.  Jesus, this show absolutely rox on all levels!  The newer box set of Season One contains the original miniseries, which is kewel.  Watching it, feeling the emotion of the show, playing into the characters angst and terror and guilt.  Supreme.  The makers of this show are not afraid to show you the little girl whose ship is about to be obliterated by Cylon nukes!  They're not afraid to show you that some people are going to have to die to save the rest of the human race from extinction.  Deep and dark and very thought-provoking.  This is what television should be like all the time.  Each and every episode takes you further into the psyche of these mal-adjusted characters, showing their flaws, their weaknesses, their undefined pockets of courage and tenacity.  This is not a retelling of Battlestar Galactica, this is what Battlestar Galactica should have been in the first place!Storyline:  Humans created the Cylons out of need, greed & necessity.  Cyborg robots to do all their dirty work throughout the years.  Well....one day the Cylons become self-aware (here we get a little Terminator on you) and decide that the humans are no longer needed.  They break away.  The fight.  A space station is created as a place where the Cylons & Humans can meet once a year to discuss peace.  In forty years the Cylons have never sent a representative to make such peace talks....until now.The Cylons have decide to upscale the conflict by total annihilation of the human race.  Using a gorgeous blond female Cylon (who looks, acts, and feels entirely human) they infiltrate the defense network of the humans via a scientist named Baltar.  Meanwhile the Battlestar Galactica, an old relic to a past way of war that is being turned into a museum, is floating out in space, making preparations to be permanently mothballed.  It's againg Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos) contemplating a career reaching its conclusion.The Cylons strike!Complete destruction!Nothing left of the human race but a rag-tag armada of ships and The Battlestar Galactica.If you take the Pepsi challenge with one show all year, make it Battlestar Galactica!

I fully expected that I would enjoy it so much I bought the second season 2.0 at the same time as the first season, and preordered 2.5. Which by the way is unbelievable that the entire second season is sold in two parts totaling around $75 for one season. So, I bought them all before even seeing the pilot and let's just say I wish I could get return them. I enjoy being entertained by some of the show plots but there are just some things I can not get past. Character inconsistencies and the constant throwing of religion and God in every single episode is just to much to handle. It's not just once but over and over again. If they are not talking about God or the gods they are praying to them and blessing them. I feel like I am being preached to in every episode. Granted, I am not particularly religious, but come on. Also, I thought this was going to be more than a space soap opera with very little space and not much in the way of interesting characters. I wish I could get my money back on this one, but a lot of people seem to really like the show although listing to characters that are machines telling others ""they should talk to God and that they want to (or are trying to) save their immortal souls"" all the time soured the milk for me. I gave it two stars because it is mildly entertaining if you can get past all the drawbacks. I watch a good bit of TV shows and  I have read a lot of reviews of this season and for the people that say this is the best show on TV now are either watching the wrong shows or do know what they are talking about.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2NBT684THTW4W	Nadege	I have to disagree with R. Yonemoto; this is a show that holds up very well to repeated viewing. It has some of the best writing and acting on TV and it features an intriguing continuing storyline that is a welcome break from the formulaic procedurals that dominate the TV landscape.Ron Moore has turned a cheesy Star Wars rip-off into a dark tale about humanity's struggle for survival against its own creations. The story is intense, compelling, and very thought-provoking. It is not mindless entertainment like most other TV shows.Unlike most sci-fi, Battlestar Galactica truly resonates with the viewer because it focuses on human interactions and emotions, and technobabble is thankfully kept to a minimum. All the characters are layered, complex, and real. The show explores human nature and real issues rather than forgettable planet/alien of the week storylines of other sci-fi shows.These are some of the reasons why many critics feel the new Battlestar Galactica is one of the best shows on TV, not just simply a great sci-fi series.	5.0	One of the few shows worth watching	2005-11-19	14	14	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A12VS13E98XPGJ	Name I Didn't Want	Normally, I work far too much to have any spare time for anything except spending it with my kids. That all changed when I couldn't work for 3 months. I got hurt on the job a and I've been going stir crazy ever since. We already had Amazon Prime, just because we ordered enough things from Amazon that it made sense. I &#34;discovered&#34; streaming while laid-up, and now it's by far my preferred method of entertainment in the wee hours when my family is all asleep and I can't yet.As it turns out, they actually have been producing some high quality TV over the last 10 years...which is funny, because it seems that every time I did actually try to sit down and watch something it was total garbage. I guess you just had to know where to look, and this show was one of those places. I really thought it would be a totally hammy knock off, but the storylines are fresh, the acting very good, and the production well funded. I'm half way through the second season, and the episodes are just starting to get a little less meaty, but still very good.In short I love this show and Amazon Prime. Being able to sit down to back to back seasons of a good show on demand without commercials is awesome.	5.0	Way better than I expected	2013-02-26	1	1	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AJHMH6ZL767MB	Nance	We discovered this series WAY after it had wrapped, so we got to binge watch.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2VHN19RHCCDJY	Nancy Hoang	When I first started watching this show, it was clear that I was missing some of the back story, but I kept watching anyway. Only later did I discover that there's a mini-series that precedes this series. I would recommend watching that first, because it gives you context (it's also free on Amazon Prime). I think the story is easy to get into and the relationships are really interesting. Once you start watching it's kind of hard to stop. You constantly want to know what's going to happen next! I highly recommend.One thing I will complain about is that I find Dr. Gaius Baltar annoying. I think he's weak and crazy, plus he's always causing trouble, but I guess it would be kind of boring without some conflict. But you can usually rely on him to provide the conflict.	5.0	It's addicting	2013-09-09	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2ANUJLB6YLUXW	Natalya	I resisted watching the pilot, but my best friend made me sit down and watch, and by the first episode after the miniseries, I was addicted to the show.  Don't worry if you didn't like the miniseries too much.  BSG only gets better and better afterwards.  However, Season 1 is definitely the best season because of the immediate multi-faceted character developments and, best of all, the mind trip of the philosophical ideas brought up.  A certain character gets the worst shock of the season, and her transformation (so to speak) is fascinating.  This is also the most realistic science fiction series in my mind.  Like Asimov, BSG is relevant and frighteningly believable.  No aliens, no one-dimensional goody-goodies who go on adventures saving the universe, time travel, etc.  The first season introduces the audience to thinking about AI in a new light.  Also, the special effects are superb for TV, the show is fast-moving, and there are great plot twists.  This is my favorite season of my favorite television show.  After a few episodes, you find yourself obsessed with it, and now that it's on Prime, you don't have to wait an entire week to see the resolution of each cliff-hanger.	5.0	The Most Thought-Provoking Science Fiction television show ever created!	2011-11-29	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3BGFHVOXHCU0J	NervXT	It's not too often I find a series that I find the interest to watch, but this is one of them.  Battlestar Galactica is, by faith, a sci-fi series, but nothing short of amazing and completely ingenious.  There are no aliens, no weird encounters with odd space creatures, it's just not that.  Normally people think of sci-fi and think of those things, but Battlestar Galactica (BSG) is focused completely on a human drama that just happens to take place in space.BSG just has everything a human drama can have; great actors, great chemistry between characters, amazing story, above-par soundtrack, and INTENSE emotional elements.  The story, in a nut-shell, is about humans fleeing from an enemy and trying to find a new home to settle.  During this time, you encounter such intense situations and character development that is rarely seen on TV these days.  I was a bit skeptical to watch this, as I have never watched the original, but you don't need to see the original to watch this nor to understand it.After watching the mini-series and the first season, I was so hooked, I thought it was some beautiful drug.  Just what happens, the intensity, the emotion, the serious emotion I felt for the characters, were seriously surprising to me.  The story flows so well together, the development was incredibly interesting, the music, so perfect, and the overall tone of the series keeps you on edge after every episode.  You'll want to learn more about whats going on, and keep watching.I've never watched a series so emotionally powerful to drive me to tears on several of the episodes, that's just not me, but it did just that.  It's compelling and will keep you watching.  If you're a Science Fiction fan or not, this series is defiantly worth checking out.  Having seen all the episodes and the dramatic finale, I think everyone who loves good TV, good movies, good anything about cinema arts, should watch this- this is a gem you should NOT pass up.There are only four seasons for a reason, because that's how long it took to tell the story.  No doubt BSG could have continued on for years to come, but the story would have not been the same as it was.  Not often do you see series cut off after the initial story, but sometimes, to remain true to your story, you have to.  If you've seen the last episodes of series 4, you'll understand it ended perfectly, or not, that's up to you.  But however you put it, if you like good TV or movies, or just good watching, this is not below you, this IS the best thing that was on TV for it's running.  Just check out the awards it won, or just watch it.  You will not be disappointed.	5.0	The best series I've ever watched!!	2009-07-29	1	1	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	If Star Wars took place a long time ago, and Star Trek is a utopian view of our future, then this reincarnation of Battlestar Galactica is probably the hardboiled option.  Humans still smoke, drink, gamble, swear, cheat, lie and steal like they always have.  Government beauracrats still fail at their jobs, high tech machines get hacked, people get drunk on the job, and heroes rise out of the woodwork.  Sounds like modern-day America.  This series was produced as a follow-up to the miniseries movie.  The cylons now come in multiple models, machine and organic; and they were created by man as sentient slaves.This season begins with the cylons chasing the remnants of the human race across the galaxy; every half an hour they catch up with the human fleet, who must then jump away.  On board the fleet are cylons that look and act and feel like humans.  One of them shoots Commander Adama in the final scene of the final episode.  The entire season is full of surprises, something the original series rarely had.  The feel of the show is driven by relationships; this is probably the first major sci-fi series driven by the evolution of relationships between the main characters.The special effects are good, and very believable.  Same goes for the cinematography, set design and costume design.  All help the movie, without having to carry it.  The soundtrack however is forgettable.  The 2003 miniseries had occasional moments where the original Battlestar theme was played; but season one has no such moments.  Worst of all, the movie's producers did not come up with anything memorable; the opening theme is a Hindu percussion piece, followed by some New Age choral singing.  Neither is dramatic, awe-inspiring or entertaining.  Overall, a good beginning to a new TV serial.	4.0	So say we all	2007-09-03	1	1	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2M3NCDXE1LKP5	Nicholas Alexander Hamm	One day, while idly browsing basic cable for something to occupy myself with, I stumbled across a space show, on SciFi, that instantly grabbed my attention. I had no idea what was going on, or what the show was, but I was hooked. I looked it up, found out what the show was (Battlestar Galactica) and went to Best Buy to purchase the miniseries. I watched it, wanted more and ordered the TV show off of Amazon. First off, I know now that the miniseries comes with Season 1. Oh well. Ebay here we come! However, I love the season 1 DVDs. Special features are alright; but the show is grand. Lots of TV included on Season 1. Just be sure to not buy the miniseries, as the Season was only like 15 bucks more. I never watched the original series, so I have no references to that. Normally space shows are like Star Trek, which have little to no character development, and rely on weird aliens and few strung together plot lines; that is to say every episode ends the story and starts a new one. BG is not like that. It is heavily character driven, relying on the development of the characters to establish the tale of being the last hope of a dying race. If you like good tv, good stories, controversial issues, and hoowah action; this is the show.	5.0	Best Show on TV	2006-03-25	10	9	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1JDGCMYIMHPL4	NotTimothyJung	All one star reviews are comparing it solely to the original series?  Well, for starters, duh:  it's a redo of the original series, so a comparison would be apt.  Why else make this new version with the same title, same character names, same premise, etc.?  Obviously the makers wanted to trade off the original series' name recognition and the nostalgia factor, otherwise these geniuses could have come up with a, ahem, new concept and story.But secondly, if you read the negative reviews--actually read them, something Timothy Jung doesn't do--you will find plenty of direct criticism of the new BG on its own merits.  I agree with others that the characters are crude stereotypes, the drama is soap opera-ish, and the futurism (the actual sci-fi content) is completely laughable.  Mostly the series is simply boring, with ridiculous premises, plot holes galore, and characters I don't care about.  I got this as a gift and simply couldn't get through the episodes.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A7I3KNC9MIMC5	"N. S. Mather ""sivamoon"""	I had several friends recommend BSG to me. Since I don't have cable I had placed the series on my Netflix queue but grew tired of waiting so I broke down and ordered the DVDs, without ever having seen an episode - something I never do. I'm glad I did.The show is very well written with good story arcs and interesting characters. A few characters, at first, seem to be rather stereotypical - the alcoholic officer, the trouble making pilot for example,  but even these characters achieve depth after a few episodes. Mary McDonnell and Edward James Olmos both deserve special praise for their acting work in this series.What interests me the most though, is some of the spiritual and philosophical questions the series grapples with. What counts as a person? What is human nature? Is there a soul? God? Simply fascinating. This is a rich, compelling series that only gets better in the second season.	5.0	Excellent Show	2007-02-22	2	2	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	Who has got a big enough brass pair to think they can offer up a challenge to Star Wars and Star Trek? Well the makers of Battlestar Galactica (BSG) are having a good blast at this top spot and the upshot is fraking mindblowing television let alone some of the best SF since Luke Skywalker met his dad and Picard became Borg.BSG season 1 comes with BSG (2003 Miniseries) on the first disc which is just under three hours long making it an epic film. The miniseries is sold standalone elsewhere, so here you get value for money. BSG (2003 Miniseries) is not the pilot. The pilot show is actually episode one of season one, but contains an opening `previously on...' to the Miniseries, so the Miniseries is mandatory BSG viewing. Essentially for the new Battlestar Galactica, start with the Miniseries on the first disc and then watch the pilot of season 1.BSG is barely recognizable from the 1970s original series. Such is the scope of the makeover and development of the original storyline that all previous BSG series history has been declared void by the writers and the story has gone through a creative renewal. This reimagining was done to enhance the concept... and the reboot has paid off in aces.The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. There are many copies. And they have a plan. In the past, there was a war. The Cylons left. Now they are back and they want revenge. They chase and try to kill humans of the twelve colonies across the galaxy.BSG has a lot of surprises in store. The story itself is kept tightly under wraps because there is a huge twist concerning the Cylons. Even the box covers are illusive. The introduction theme to each series is instantly unforgettable as is the way each episode is quickly condensed into a flash sequence at the start of the instalment (although this does change for season 2).Season 1 takes place mainly on the deck of the Galatica, but also on Colonial One (the President's cruise ship), the planets Caprica, Kobal and inside a Cyclon basestar. There is lots of powerhouse acting. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) quickly becomes one of the most memorable characters in television history (you can rank him up there with the likes of Captain Picard). Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) slowly transcends into a pivotal character as catastrophes unfold. Starbuck is somebody very new and the role will amaze fans. Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber) brings a new breed of hero to the table and Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) is the science geek with a secret to hide. Number Six (Tricia Helfer) will stun everybody with her looks and cold-blooded cruelty. Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) is the second in command with a drinking problem and who has no qualms about venting his staff into space. Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park) is a pilot with a heart of gold dating Chief Petty Officer Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) who does his best to make sure the ships are ready for launch and not blowing up in the service area. This is but a small section of the enormous cast that BSG has to offer. Expect lots of high-voltage drama in with the rapid paced action scenes.The CGI is impeccable with some the biggest, fastest, most furious space battles since George Lucas. The fleet lead by the Galactica looks beautiful as they cruise through green glowing star clusters avoiding detection by the ever searching Cylons. The real stars of the show are the screenwriters. It is their boat and they are taking us on what appears to be a voyage unparallel to anything else you have seen before.BSG is also post-9/11 brain candy. The writers sometimes jab at the Bush administration foreign and war policies and then again seem to back them up. The constant search for fossil fuels and battling for control of resources while freedoms get restricted in the fight against terrorism, models this struggle. There is an interesting religious confrontation involving polytheism (the human belief system in BSG) and monotheism (the Cylon belief system). One show in particular focuses on the topic of torturing prisoners.Season 1 is mostly about the invasion followed by the Galactica convoy of the twelve colonies trying to find its way back to Earth (which may or may not exist). The convoy hyperjumps to new coordinates periodically whenever a Cylon basestar finds them. This season revolves around domestic issues such as the political situation of the convoy, romantic dramas that get in the way of the line of duty, traitors, the prisoner's dilemma, washing out, paranoia, sacrifice, abandonment, elections, gods, prophecy, destiny, assassination plots and coups.If you are a fan of SF or just high-quality television, then nothing should be holding you back. BSG could very well be the most important SF TV since Star Trek. It certainly has propelled itself out of this world and is in a dimension all of its own... except when Cylons appear. Oh and did we mention that it did all of this in just one season?	5.0	Buy Your Command	2008-02-03	7	7	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2DJ5SRAGWMYSL	Pain&#257;poro	"Battlestar Galactica?  My goodness, what a horrible name for a TV show!  If my co-worker hadn't assured me it was worth watching I never would have given it a chance.  I had never heard of the original show (wasn't even born yet) and there are a lot of sci-fi series out there that I can't stand (Star Gate, Firefly, Voyager).  On the other hand I do love drama and shows with emotional depth and complex story lines.  Before BSG came into my life I would have said my favorite show of all time was HBO's Six Feet Under.  BSG has all the drama, depth, character development, and intelligent writing that Six Feet Under had but on top of all that you get some amazing special effect and battles in space!  I've also always been partial to stories concerning the end of the world and the self destructive nature of mankind (I was particularly fond of Stephen King's The Stand).  Battlestar Galactica takes all my favorite genres and premises and swirls them together to make one amazing show that is part sci-fi, part political thriller, and part spiritual fantasy.  If you're just looking for another Star Trek: The Next Generation you may be in the wrong place.  If, however, you loved Star Trek: Deep Space Nine then BSG will take you to a whole new level.You can't go wrong with Season One.  Every single episode is worthy of multiple viewings.  The weakest episode is either ""Water"" or ""Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down"" but in all honesty they still carry their weight.If you like BSG then I would also highly recommend the soundtrack.  The music of the show is beautiful and integral.  At first it may just seem like a bunch of percussion but as you make your way towards the finale of this season you should really start to notice some of the excellent musical themes.Also, be careful when purchasing.  I made the same mistake so many others made.  This set INCLUDES the MINISERIES.  Luckily I realized my error and was able to cancel my miniseries order before it shipped.  Season 4.0 also includes Razor so don't go buying that separately either."	5.0	Stupid name, but amazing show!	2009-01-12	1	0	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A9PRK90A8BTAI	"Patrick ""lakesideman1"""	"BSG is one of the best shows on television...PERIOD.It takes the campy series of the late 70's and gives it a drastic and dramtic overhaul.  It wants the viewer to thing what they are seeing is real, or at least as real as a Sci-Fi show can be.  There are no pristine, clutter free halls on this starship like you find on ST:TNG, there is dirt on the floor and things leak on this ship.What this series requires most is for the viewer to be smart and make an mental investment in the show...it certainly is not for the ""American Idol"" crowd.Season one picks up where the mini-series leaves off.  It gives us characters who very much like everyone in the world today are not easy to label...there are no good guys and bad guys.  We have noble people who are capable of terrible lapses in judgement and terrible people who experience occassional moments of compassion.  Then the most delicious of all...character like Gius Baltar who swing so far from one side to another that we are not sure where it heading but the ride is amazing.Multiple story arcs are prsented throughout the season such as what is happening with the fleet compared to what is happening with Helo on Caprica and never once does the writing pander down to the viewer to catch them up...they assume you are paying attention.The writers even go into small details that are often missed like in the opening episode 33 (one of the finest in the run of the series) where they subtle strains of being on consistant watch are deftly highlighted.Many will dismiss this series because of the Sci-Fi setting, but this is really a top notch drama that just happens to be set in outer space.  You will not find a more complex cast of regular characters anywhere on television today.Like any series, some episodes are stronger than others, but for the most part even the clunkers here are better than most everything else on TV.  The season sets the table, telling us the backstory and moving things forward for the very good seasons 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0"	5.0	This is not just the best Sci-Fi show on TV.	2008-12-23	1	1	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	"After the astounding success of the ""Battlestar Galactica: Mini-series"", which launched Ronald Moore's incredible re-imagined version of this the campy 70's sci-fi series, it was fait accompli that the planned full-run television series would follow.With a bit more of a budget and stronger television backing, Ronald Moore was able to refine the visuals of the series and delve deeper in the background and major issues facing the `rag-tag' fleet of survivors and their Cylon pursuers.The season starts off with the compelling episode, ""33"", whose title references how many minutes it takes the Cylons to appear after every FTL jump by the Colonials.  By the start of the episode, the Colonials are already well past their 200th cycle of this cat-and-mouse game, and the profound effects of sleep deprivation are clear.  How this situation ends of resolving itself presents difficult topics for debate, especially in the post-9/11 world.Other important subjects are broached, such as the trying to maintain a working society, including a functioning, representative government (not just an emergency war powers dictatorship).  The importance of faith, which is prevalent theme throughout the series, gets emphasized as President Roslin risks conflict in her quest for signs and symbols that can get the fleet to Earth.Personal backgrounds are revealed as we learn more about Starbuck's history and her connection with Lee and Commander Adama.  For better or for worse, we get introduced to Colonel Tigh's promiscuous and alcoholic wife, Ellen.  We also begin to learn a little bit more about humanoid Cylons and the overall Cylon culture, especially as Sharon Valerii comes to terms with who she is.A few attempts to pay homage to original show during the pilot mini-series never really took off once Season 1 began.  They tried to have the young moppet Boxey (a regular on the 1970's series) be brought into this series by having him escape Caprica and develop a bond with Boomer.  Alas, it became clear that there was not any place for this character in the new series and he was quickly dropped.  Another is the use of the nefarious Cylon phrase, ""by your command"", which was so prevalent in the 1970's series.  They used it once during at the conclusion of the mini-series.  It, too, had no traction in this contemporary show.  The phrase was quickly overrun by Colonials mantra of strength and hope, ""so say we all"".One nod that worked was bringing actor Richard Hatch (the original Apollo) back for this series, as terrorist (and political `thorn-in-the-side') Tom Zarek.  This was a move that brought an extra layer of depth and intrigue to the story line and also helped reluctant fans of the original series feel ok about this one.One weakness through the first season was the acting of Grace Park (Sharon Valerii).  It was very raw and unpolished (not in a good way).  As this was my third time through the series, my initial feelings about her performance this season were confirmed.  This is clearly an aberration limited to Season 1, because Park did a wonderful job throughout the remainder of the series, especially as she came to terms with, and accepted, her Cylon background.  This was one of her earlier acting jobs.  So, it could just be chalked up to inexperience.Overall, Season 1 rewarded the optimism of science-fiction fans who were so taken by the mini-series.  The cliff-hanging conclusion of this season set the stage for dramatic fireworks that would power Season 2"	5.0	Season 1 is the satisfying full kickoff to this epic series	2013-07-17	0	0	0

A great many recent space operas have stepped way past the point where the setting overshadows the characters and the premise becomes alienating. Along with Firefly, the new Battlestar Galactica is one of the few shows this decade that has truly achieved this feat. The action blazes and the special effects are consistently impressive, as is par for the course among this set of shows. Yet the characters and plots are rich with real meaning, and the acting is well above average for TV - considerably less common in this genre. Battlestar Galactica's balance puts it well above the competition.There's no way to make the premise of Battlestar Galactica sound good on paper, but I'll do my best. The 12 colonies of humanity are destroyed in a nuclear attack by the robotic Cylons, who have created agents indistinguishable from humans. The lone military vessel that survives the attack is the aging Galactica, which leads a fleet of the few human survivors on a quest for the long-lost home of humanity, Earth. Of course, this was all in the schlocky 70s cheese-fest of the same name (except for the Cylon agents). The new Galactica adds a tension between the military leaders of the Galactica and the civilian leaders of the fleet and several other notable plot twists.Anyway, there's no point in trying to make the premise sound defensible. What really puts Battlestar Galactica atop the sci-fi heap is the acting and writing. Oscar-caliber actors fill out the two lead roles (Edward James Olmos & Mary McDonnell), and the supporting cast does an excellent job as well. Particularly impressive is James Callis as an unwilling pawn of the Cylons, whose turn toward madness is wonderfully realized. For their part, the writers do their very best to keep the show, despite its setting, down to earth. The characters are plainspoken and the plot tension never relies on made-up technology. Instead of technobabble, we get an intense and entertaining allegory of the dilemmas facing our world in the war on terror.This DVD box includes the original three-hour miniseries, which is probably the set's single greatest highlight. Other standout episodes include Bastille Day, Act of Contrition/You Can't Go Home Again, The Hand of God, and Colonial Day. Really, there's not a whole lot of fat on this season, or on the show at all. It's consistently gripping, entertaining, and challenging. Strongly recommended.	5.0	Don't let the setting scare you	2006-06-13	3	2	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AFHNNJFCQB4RM	Paul S. Fratianni	This is the only first season show I have ever given five stars to. One of the great things the show does is not to assume the audience is stupid therefore the plot and acting have taken on a greater emotional range than usual. As for the special effects, I simply do not see how they are any different than a blockbuster movie. The show does not lean on this fact either with the acting being even more fascinating with incredible scripts that have many complexities foreshadowing many possibilities. Battlestar Galactica is the best night time drama on Television to date which has not only restored my faith in Hollywood but also confirmed my commitment to the wonderfully epic quality that is the television series.	5.0	Only First Season to Receive 5 Stars	2007-02-11	3	3	0

I liked the fact that the show was a more realistic, grittier take on the original (I was particularly offended by the silly, campy nature of the two part episode titled 'War of the Gods' -- don't get me wrong...

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3Q0AFLFEZWMSV	pj	"Battlestar Gallactica is a great show that takes its place among the classics of small screen SF (Twilight Zone, Farscape, Xfiles etc).  Now a warning to folks who haven't watched it yet.  THis is one of the darkest shows on TV today.  Ron Moore treats the sitaution, the end of the world, with the appropriate level of gravity.  If you are looking for light hearted space opera like Firefly or Star Trek this is not the show for you.  A lot of the folks who have given this negative reviews can be lumped into two overlapping groups: first people who loved the original and just can't get over it (if Richard Hatch can appear on the new version you guys should grow up and give it a shot), and people who complain that it's not ""escapist"".  The last is true in a sense (although I would argue that watching the drama of other peoples problems distracts from my own).  However, it is not a fair criticism.  The creators of the new Battlestar Galactica have set out to tell a heavy dramatic and dark story of humanity on the brink of extinction.  They aren't setting out to tell a light hearted rollicking sci-fi tale ala Firefly or Stargate.  To criticize Gallactica for not being such a show is not fair because it never intended to be.  Now I'm not questioning the appropriateness of shows like Firefly or Stargate (never cared for Firefly, but I loved Farscape which was at times very light hearted).  There's definitely a place for those types of shows.  I'm also not questioning folks who, as a matter of personal preference don't enjoy dark and heavy entertainment (I think it's a shame because you're missing great stuff, but that's what you like).  What I have a problem with is people who assume that there is not a place for dark and heavy entertainment.  That the ONLY legitimate entertainment is light-hearted fare that works only on the level of escapism.  That idea is pure bull.  There's plenty of room for many different types of entertainment and just because you don't like a particular chosen approach does not mean that a show is bad, or inappropriate."	5.0	A great show-don't listen to the haters	2005-10-10	24	23	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A260X99UW6HA9Z	Prauge Traveler	"This show is simply one of the most exciting and interesting on television today.  Battlestar Galatica takes traditional science fiction and blends it with modern drama in a way that I found completely unexpected and amazing.  Fans of SciFi will eat this show up- as I have; and fans of great drama will also find Battlestar accessible.  The show itself can be described as a mix of Band of Brothers, the movie Aliens with elements of the original Battlestar storyline.What the writers and producers have achieved is a scifi story that seems more plausible than the typical entries in this genre.  No one will believe the story is real- don't get me wrong -but it seems more grounded in reality.  The series has a gritty edge, and tension, that is not usually present in scifi.  The writing also sticks to the main premise, and only deviates if the new course advances the original dilemma: How will mankind survive?The premise of the show is that mankind has fought a major war with a breed of robot drones, called the Cylons, barely survived and begun the process of forgetting that unpleasant history.  The Miniseries, which is included in this collection (DON'T BUY THE MINISERIES IF YOU PURCHASE THIS SET), details the Cylons' latest attack on humanity.  Of the entire First Season, this opening Miniseries is the weakest element.  And when I say this, it is like saying a one carrot diamond smaller than a two carrot diamond.  The Miniseries is still a lot of fun to watch, and it introduces all the major characters as well as the central dilemma of the show: how will mankind survive, and where will we find a home?Battlestar really gets its legs and transforms into an amazing series when the fifty minute episodes begin.  The characters are interesting to watch, most are flawed and more than caricatures, and they are always presented with tough decisions and limited circumstances.  This is not a show that solves all of its problems with each episode, and that makes it amazingly addictive.One critique is that the element of spirituality in the show can be slightly annoying: ""By the Gods"", ""Frack"", ""The Lords of Kobol"". . . .  to name the principal offenders.  Each time a character says something about the ""Lords of Kobol"", I have to keep from smiling- even a hardcore fan has to acknowledge this as a little ridiculous.  This is a small comment on otherwise great writing, and it is incorporated into the storyline in a decent fashion.  The fact that the robot monsters seem to be monotheistic, whereas humanity has reverted to polytheism also is an interesting twist.I also like the conflict between the military and the civilian government.  This gives the series a chance to comment indirectly on some of the contemporary issues that we are currently facing today in the war on terror.  It also brings to life some 'worst case scenario' situations that are just entertaining to contemplate.  ""Battlestar"" does so in a fair manner that encourages discussion and thought, rather than a one-sided partisan argument.The episodes of Season One will keep you up late at night.  If you haven't seen this series, then start watching.  You won't regret it."	5.0	Battlestar Galactica = Totally Awesome	2006-04-12	5	3	2

Ive watched this many times.  I am still amazed at how the actors were able to really capture the feeling of sleep depravity in so many ways.  Adama forgetting the sleep rotation, Cally mumbling about why its every 33 minutes, Starbuck and Lee fighting over her taking her pills, and my favorite scene, Baltar telling the President to wake and realize the danger of the Olympic Carrier.  The whole episode is acted to perfection and when Commander Adama calls everyone to action stations on the return of the Olympic Carrier to the fleet you will literally feel the tension of the moment and the dread that the 33 minutes cycle is starting all over again.

There isn't a lot of space fighting - it's a complicated political drama about a group of people trying to do what's right to keep themselves going. I love this show! You'll probably enjoy it if you have some interest in science fiction, and it will be better if you are familiar with Biblical and/or Greek philosophy, and I think that if you liked West Wing, you will feel very at home in this universe, surprising as that may sound.	5.0	Great Start to a Great Show	2012-12-25	1	0	1

The pace of the first part of the mini-series is tedious but the second part is better. I wish it were just two hours long. I began watching the weekly series and found it promising, but also slow and padded. Along the way I stopped watching the series on a regular basis.

""Rach"""	"I watched the finale just a couple of weeks ago and found the last 45 mins (or 30 mins) so boring it was pitiful. I thought the 2 hour pilot was excellent since it was a war.I really thought the actress playing Starbuck wasn't that great. Girl, not a problem. But, insubordinate jerk is a problem. Her getting whacked later in the series was kinda funny.Olmos was a little too old for this series, and so was his XO. Olmos said the series was a once in a lifetime experience. Sheesh!I did love Baltar and Six's characters. In the finale, Six showed some vulnerabilities which the original BG never got. Six always made you wonder. My fav character was Six (Tricia Helfer) since she got to spread her wings so to speak. Mary McDonnell was a fun choice. Thought the cancer thing was a bit overdramatic. Six and Baltar (who did get annoying) was really the only reason I watched the series.Simply put, if you saw the first 2 hours pilot (the Cylon War and destruction of the 12 planets) and the finale, you saw it all.When they got to Earth, that was boring. I wish they would have spent some more time in S1 on Caprica and BG telling the backstory. Instead, the writers just threw Six and her other Cylons to ""explain it."" Now, they are going to have a ""Caprica"" series. Who cares? I already know the ending. They find Earth and live in tents.The religion was incongruent. Baltar going from science genius to religous nut was kinda strange.In the end, I think Six's character actually had more real humanity and a fuller character arch than anyone throughout the entire series. Funny how she was the first one in the Series you saw.The movie The Razor was excellent. Michelle Forbes did a great job. I think her character was more real that most of the humans.

I think the filming style works very well and it's never caused me to feel nauseous even though I suffer from motion sickness in real life.2. No, the writers did not pull the pregnancy out of their butts. Six mentions in one of the first few episodes that she wants a baby. Please give examples of the other supposed plot holes.3. The characters are unemotional? I don't know how you define emotion but most people define it as when a person exhibits joy, grief, love, fear, etc.. There is a lot of that on this show. I would go so far as to say the characters show more emotion than on any other show on TV (maybe with the exception of Lost).4. Actually the music on this show is outstanding. I highly recommend the Battlestar Galactica soundtrack.7. When exactly does Roslin do ""stupid, moralistic crap to protect her own butt""? Provide some examples. And there is no Admiral on the show in the first season.As for the show being cancelled: Not likely. It's the highest-rated show on the Scifi channel (although not by a big margin) and the DVDs seem to be selling very well. Also, this show is Scifi's only source of critical acclaim, I doubt they want to give up all the positive attention. Time Magazine, Newsday, Boston Globe, Boston Herald, USA Today, TV Without Pity, etc. have high praise for the new Battlestar Galactica.. some even named it the best drama on TV."	5.0	TV's best drama	2005-10-13	22	20	2

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AZGE6MNSSXY6Y	readerfromaustin	The original show was a joke that someone who grew up watching Star Trek could not bear to watch. It was not just the cheesy special effects - it felt just like a TV Western show migrated to space, and having the guy from Bonanza only enforced that.To my delight I learned through the comments here at Amazon that the original show had been cancelled before the story ended - a well deserved closure to this brainless parody of a science fiction show, a disgrace to the genre, perhaps only better than Buck Rogers, another low point in sci-fi history.The baggage of the old show pushed me away from this new version until a friend who watched the original suggested I should take a look at this one - according to him it was a much more mature story line. By then I had already missed the first season. I was instantly hooked to it after the very first episode I watched.Finally, after Farscape, the SciFi channel came up with a show in which you could not guess the ending of the episodes, unlike the original BattleStar Galactica (and the original SG1) which had a very linear story telling.	5.0	Amazing transformation	2006-02-25	4	2	2

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A4EEQE9X7US67	Regis C. Bondrole	"Back in 2003, when the SciFi channel started to advertise their ""reimagination"" of Battlestar Galactica, I admit I had a smirk smile at first.I had grown up with the original BSG, and after having passed childhood, it became clear that BSG had that cheezy 70's/early 80's vibe that was akin Buck Rogers and Logan's Run. Cheezy indeed.BSG 1980 didn't help the franchise at all, of course (more like burried it).So with that in mind, I saw the first trailers and was intrigued by the apparently very good SFX.Came December 2003, and, to put it bluntly, I was blown away by the mini series. Gone the simplist ""us good humans them bad robots"" plot. Gone the cheezy SFX with re-uses of the same plans over and over again. Gone are the overacted dialogues, and simplified character interractions.Ron Moore gave us gritty action, hardcore SF and uncompromisingly good acting.James Edward Olmos and Marry O'Donell get the Lion's share, but every single other actor is top notch (I would mention the actors playing Starbuck and Apollo, but also the new and improved Baltar and his ""evil muse"" -6-, but the entire cast is excellent). The themes seen in the 13 first episodes are varied, but the tone is uniformly dark. Very dark. The producers wanted also to tie in the show with real events, and they do this successfully, in the end arriving with a show that is much deeper than the original.Action is sometime few and far between in regard of the human drama, but when it is delivered, it counts (""33"", ""You can't go home again"", ""Hand of God"", ""Gleams of Kobol""...), with SFX that put to shame every other SCiFi show of recent production.From a show that has been a decent 1970's follower to Star Wars but fell in the trap of time due to cheezyness and cheap production values as time went by (it got cancelled after only one season), we now have what might become one of the best SciFi show -ever-. As of now, already, it has joined DS9, ST:TNG, Babylon 5, The Twilight Zone and Farscape in the pantheon of the best Sci Fi shows ever produced in my opinion.This DVD set, particularly, is one of the best buys you can get currently. Not only does it include deleted scenes and commentaries, as well as the lowdown shown on SCiFi, it also includes the miniseries on top of the 13 episodes of Season 1.(Warning: Were you to buy a BSG DVD set at Best Buy, be warned. There are two versions at that place. BB got an exclusive back in June to sell a box early, but it is a ""Diet"" version, without the miniseries and without many of the extras. BB is the only place where you might be confused)Last, one of the most remarkable things about BSG '04, is how consistent the quality is. Season 2 proved (until the end of septembre 05, when we arrived at the mid season break) to be just as good if not better than season 1. The only problem with BSG is to have to wait for the next episode, most of the time :)"	5.0	One of the best shows on TV. Period.	2005-10-04	23	22	1

This is so mature, so weel thought out and executed, the actors all excellent, I cannot fathom how the same hacks at sci-fi that did piranhaconda and sharktopus would be capable of something this good. Which explains why they no longer make it- it must have rankled their ""godzilla vs an octopus with aids and a shark head"" idiot mentality to produce high quality with great actors. The great casting and writing alone propel this to another level. Combined with great effects and apparently, carte blanche to make a great show not a hack show and you have one epic series. The depth in plot is there for those who care but it works anyway; it offers more to those who care to dig deeper. Olmos, of Miami Vice fame, may have shadowed that, and I say that as a huge fan of Vice."	5.0	amazing	2012-07-25	0	0	0

I know a lot of people are into it.  I tried.  It didn't happen.  I'm not sure if I felt manipulated or that the show lacked a sophisticated realism.  Maybe not.  Something is just not right.  There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth.  A superficiality.  A lack of...of...I'm at a loss.  An ambitious, hollow, vapid endeavor, like Lost or Heroes or Stargate Atlantis or Firefly.  Since X-Files and ST:TNG ended, I'm not sure there's been any sci-fi series that has touched me.  I need something that will challenge me, perhaps, and none of this stuff is doing that.  They all just seem, I don't know, dumbed down, or something. No offense.  Maybe it's an overly fashionable, trendy, commercialized quality they all have.

This is a space opera with plots and subplots woven together to make a very rivoting story that is intelligent, but does not confuse.  It is a darker more modern storytelling, so fans of the old series may be put off.  I personally can't recommend this enough.	5.0	Outstanding	2005-09-19	24	22	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3N7HHBZNUJ6D6	R. Hedges	"First-I have to admit, when this show first hit the Sci-Fi network in 2005, I was a little skeptical, but as time went on, I heard more and more favorable things about it, from non-Science Fiction friends, so I finally bought it.Before you watch this show-if you are familiar with the original, try to imagine you are watching something completely new for the very first time.It turned out to be as good as people had told me it was-this isn't the light hearted, campy show that the original one was-this is ""serious drama in space"" which was a change I wasn't expecting.  Very, very character driven-not that I'm complaining.  It is kind of like Babylon 5 in the way the characters are very multilayered and how decisions they make almost always have long term effects as the story progresses.  Also, like Babylon 5, it's a continuous flow-the characters personalities and environment aren't ""reset"" at the end of each show.  The CG Cylons are more menacing in design and structure and the fact that some of them are in human form help to blur the lines between who can be trusted, boosting the continuous infltration theme that shrouds all the stories.What makes this work is that you are watching contemporary ideas in a fictional setting, complex stories, no Star Trek ""technobabble"" to magically solve a problem, a great deal of realism (characters have a lot of real human flaws), and a show that lives in the grey area along with a superior reimagining of a show from the late 70's.  I personally found the  sexual relationship between Gaius Baltar and Number Six amusing at a very subtle level.  Definitely not a show for young children.The only reason I won't knock the original show is because I saw it as a child, and back then, there weren't a whole lot of Sci-Fi shows at all.Oh, and did I mention that Glen Larson from the original show is a creative consultant on several shows?  You do have to watch this from start to finish-you can't jump in the middle.Yeah, this is good stuff, definitely.  I'll be buying Season 2 for sure and see if the quality and consistency stick around.

I'd say their intended target audience was pimple-faced drooling teenage boys because of the frequent and regular sex scenes and the MTV style shaky-cam/snap-zoom style of shooting.  The show seems bi-polar.  One minute it's intelligent and interesting, the next minute it delves into the juvenile.

The personalities of the main characters in this remake are not as well developed as in the original.  I bought the first season DVDs for the sole reason that Mary McDonnell was in it, and I liked her character in The Closer.  The story line of the new Galactica is the same, namely trying to escape from the Cylons who are trying to kill the humans.  The big difference is that now there are human copies of Cylons in the human general population who are trying to sabotage the humans.

I had been a fan of the original as a kid and even though that one was cheesy it still had a special place in my memory.  I should not have worried.  The new Battlestar takes everything that I loved about the original, removes the cheese, and makes it darker and more realistic.  I love this show.  This show is actually what I had hoped for with Star Trek Voyager, but of course never got.  A ragtag fleet, on its own, trying to survive against a superior enemy.

Yes, the packaging is unique, but it doesnt seem to be the cause for the scratches... unless the flimsy-ness of the packaging has allowed for bending the disks in transit and the circles are due to stress...Since this problem is so widespread, if there is no recall...

It's different from other series, in that (like life) not every conflict is resolved in every episode or as cleanly as in a Hollywood blockbuster.  The plots, conflicts, friendships, and betrayals are intertwined and woven irregardless of episode, or even season breaks.  The story unfolds like reading a novel, at it's own pace.  Season one launches out of the gate, as the humans, get pretty much evicted from their home world, by their own creation evolved, the Cylons. And so the story begins...  The music or score of the series is fantastically enhancing to the story telling and non intrusive.  The space scenes and battles are eerily hushed and visually wonderful.  The camera angles always put you right in the face of the characters, involving you in the story.  I can't recommend this enough!  Battlestar Galactica is a: turn up the surround system, turn off the phone and lock the door, engrossing epic.  I buy the dvds to savor the genius of the series with out the insult of commercial breaks, and to loan to friends to catch up.

I suspect that the mini-series might not have been filmed in HD, and the producers switched to HD for the series.  (The technical info on IMDB appears to support that theory.)  Still, a good HD remastering of a non-HD source should produce better results than this, as it has on countless older films out there on Blu-Ray and HD-DVD.That said, the first season episodes in this release are definitely HD, and look much better than the mini-series, and better than the standard DVD.However, as everyone knows HD-DVD is dead, I don't recommend buying this until the price drops considerably, unless you are a collector or a rabid BSG fan, or both.  What BSG fans should ultimately hope for is a Blu-Ray release of the entire series, with a better HD presentation of the mini-series.	3.0	Great show, not the best DVD	2009-01-17	3	2	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3CRL8O7RVMYLG	R. Mena	I loved the first season of the new Battlestar Galactica but didn't realize how really great it was until I re-watched it on DVD. First of all, the quality of the picture is so much better on DVD than it was on standard cable TV signal. I have a 30'inch widescreen Sony HDTV and it looks awsome. Secondly, this series is like any great film or TV show, the more times you watch it the more you discover how really complex and engaging it is. The space battle scenes are also amazing and beat anything the new Star Wars films have to offer. But what trully makes this a great TV show is the story and character developments. To me, the new Galactica is on par with great TV dramas like ER or the West Wing except that its story happens to take place in a believable sci-fi world. I never watch anything else on the Sci-Fi channel except for this show and whenever they re-air the original 1970's Galatica. People who have a prejudice against Sci-fi (and thats the vast majority of people) should give this TV show a try because it goes far beyond its genre, it simply is great filmmaking that takes place on TV.	5.0	Exquisite TV drama that happens to take place in a Sci-fi world	2006-11-30	6	6	0

I enjoyed the show immensely, and was disappointed with its cancellation.  But as much as I have enjoyed the original series, I have also become a fan of the new BSG series on SCI-FI.  As I have grown up, so has BSG.  The producers and writers have developed a program which can appeal to science fiction fans and non-fans alike.  The characters are much more human, more realistic here than in the original series.  Edward James Olmos makes a great successor to Lorne Greene in the role of Commander Adama.  Jamie Bamber, Katee Sackhoff and Grace Park have delivered delightfully believable performances as Captain Lee ""Apollo"" Adama, Lieutenant Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace and Lieutenant Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii, respectively.  And Mary McDonnell has been a joy to watch as President Laura Roslin.  The storylines have become more complex, engrossing and entertaining.  Instead of the gleaming, pristine spaceship sets of the the original program, the new BSG sets have a grittier look and feel which I absolutely love.  Season One of Battlestar Galactica has been extremely enjoyable, and I am currently enjoying Season Two (a milestone the original BSG never reached)."	5.0	Fan of the original BSG loves the new series as well.	2005-09-01	30	27	3
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A22JFC81LANF09	"Robert Drain ""Rob_in_Toronto"""	"Way back when BSG premiered I saw the pilot in the movie theatre and thought it was ok.  No Star Wars that was for sure.  When it came to TV I watched a few episodes but found it to be silly in a ""Lost in Space"" kind of way.  I guess being 12 or 13 I was too old for it.  I didn't miss it.When this new version of show came on I watched the premier on TV and was hooked.  From the very beginning act I knew it wasn't aimed at 10 year olds it was aimed at a more grown up audience.The shows just get better as the series progressed, episodes like 33 and Water really focus on how BAD things are going for these survivors.A mixed bag of characters, some good, most ok, some bad, some unknown also create great interactions.  We, the audience, actually don't know yet how this series will end, but this is the beginning and it is worth buying.The HD transfer is perfect, worked flawlessly on my a20.  The interactive features are also pretty cool, and will likely get you to re-watch episodes just to see those.A must have title for sci-fi folks."	5.0	Better than the original series	2007-12-05	5	1	4

Before I started my viewing I tried to watch the original 1978 series.  I was a bit disappointed when I discovered that the original series hadn't aged very well.  It was horrible! I had to stop watching after three shows.  The new series (beginning in 2004) is outstanding. The drama palpable. The action an adrenaline rush. The hot young actors and actresses make me feel young again. The acting is top notch, and the talent is clearly evident in the outstanding cast.  The writing through season 1 has been exceptionally strong, and I'm now entrenched in the second season.  It's an excellent show. I wish I had watched it way back in 2004. Thanks you Amazon Prime.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is a series that represents television about as good as it gets. It is a show that can be praised and assessed on so many levels that it difficult to know where to start. Let's start with narrative. One of the great developments in television in the late 1990s and continuing to the present--and the development that finally enabled a number of television series to surpass the majority movies as a thinking person's form of entertainment--was the complete embrace of the long narrative format. While HILL STREET BLUES had introduced the multiple arc format, working through the serial rather than the episodic form, the nineties saw a further and major development in television narrative. Beginning with TWIN PEAKS and continuing with THE X-FILES (at least in the mythology episodes) and finding completion in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, shows more and more ceased telling shorter stories and focused on telling a single story, either during a full season or over several seasons. In their wake we have seen a number of series that try to tell a primary story over the course of time, including shows like FARSCAPE, ALIAS, THE SHIELD, LOST, and VERONICA MARS. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is an outstanding representative of this comparatively new form of extended narrative. When it ended, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA had told a single story. No other SF series that I know of remained so focused on the main story, not even FIREFLY or FARSCAPE or BABYLON 5 (though in the case of the latter it was hurt by its sudden cancellation at the end of its fourth season, only to be renewed after it had rushed to wrap up the main story in far fewer episodes than they anticipated).One could also focus on the show's visuals. Although a SF series on the grand scale, much of the camera and sound technique derives more from police procedurals such as HILL STREET BLUES and NYPD BLUE, which in turn were heavily influenced by Robert Altman's work. Almost all of the camerawork involves hand-held cameras, frequently the center of the action is left slightly to the side of the shots, and the camera frequently uses its zoom function. The scenes in outer space are similarly unique, with the earlier series FIREFLY as a major inspiration. That series had developed the use of zoom in CGI and even allowed shots to be slightly out of focus. The same group that did FIREFLY's special effects worked on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA in its first season and obviously brought some aesthetic ideas along with them (the spaceship Serenity even made a brief appearance in the miniseries).Or one could focus on character. More than spaceships or planetary travel or politics, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is about people. One of the truisms about SF in written form is that compared to mainstream literature it tends to be weak on character, a truism that is acknowledged by the very best writers and scholars (many SF fans even complain when books have realistic characters, feeling that the books should focus on ideas instead). The reason that is usually given is that the setting and world necessarily tends to overwhelm individual characters, since novels are more about visions than anything. With some exceptions, I think this holds true of SF novels and short stories, but is not always true of television SF. There is significant character development in both FARSCAPE and FIREFLY, and especially in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. For all the action in the series, every episode without exception spends considerable time getting very, very close to a number of individuals, learning what makes them tick, exploring their fears and predilections, exploring their psyches. For all the big sets and space ships and CGI and robots, the show continuously foregrounds individuals.Or one could focus on the writing. This is a superbly written series. The show's creator Ronald Moore rewrites all of the episodes. As a result, it doesn't feel like a show written by committee, but the product of a single imagination. Most of the elements of the series came, of course, from the 1978 BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series. I don't want to offend fans of that series, but debates about which of the two is better are simply silly. On every level the newer series vastly outstrips the original, not just in the quality of special effects and production quality, but in acting, writing, or whatever. Primarily this is because it is so much better and more tightly written than the original. Speaking of the cast, how many series can boast not one but two Oscar nominated actors? Edward James Olmos, in addition to having won an Emmy for his work on MIAMI VICE, was nominated for his great performance in STAND AND DELIVER, while Mary McDonnell has been nominated twice, for PASSION FISH and for DANCES WITH WOLVES.Finally, one could focus on the tone of the series. This is a very, very dark show. Everyone on the show makes mistakes, everyone on the show is fallible, and some make very serious errors of judgment. Very bad things happen to people and things can often go from bad to worse. There is both moral and metaphysical complexity running throughout the show. From the moment that Jenny Calendar was murdered by Angel on BUFFY, I decided that the best TV always goes for the hurt, an opinion that I have had reaffirmed on many occasions. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA definitely goes for the hurt, and the first season ends with nearly every major character in a very nasty place.This is a major achievement in television art. Not just fans of SF but also devotees of quality television really need to see this series. Entertainment only rarely gets this good.	5.0	Quality television of the highest rank	2009-10-30	24	15	9

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A6TWN2RMQW44X	Roger M.	As an 11 year old kid during the Star Wars craze of 1977, I thoroughly enjoyed the original Battlestar Galactica when it first aired a year later. While it wasn't Star Wars in terms of technical merits, at the time it was as close as I was going to be to having ongoing Star Wars-style adventures. To a twelve-year-old starved for adventure and fantasy, it meant a lot.I also had a fine appreciation for the tales of Captain Kirk on board his Starship Enterprise. More adventure in a completely different package, Star Trek opened my prepubescent eyes to what might not be beyond the realm of possibility... one day. Years later, when Next Generation appeared, Star Trek took on new life, raising the bar above the notches set by all other television science fiction before it. Its wonderfully crafted stories with the human adventure at their heart lifted television audiences onto a spacegoing vehicle, confined them to a relatively small space on their way to nowhere in particular, and made them ecstatic to feel they were a part of something greater. It was science fiction's finest hour.Now, with the reproduction of Galactica comes a chain of tales told in a way that grabs the audience by the chest and dares us to turn away. It steps out of the cloak of science fiction and becomes at once a tale of mystery, drama, action and suspense at a level never before achieved by science fiction for a television audience. Galactica has grown up and become a tough, gritty giant of its former self.The last Battlestar: Galactica and a small fleet of refugee ships is all that remains of a massive assault on the homeworld of Caprica which left little more than a planet-wide nuclear winter behind. Led by William Adama, the military-minded commander of the aging battlestar, the small band of survivors is given a small, but seemingly fictional spark of hope that another homeworld exists; one based on legend and myth, and whose existence is known only by a handful.Battlestar Galactica uses myth and legend to achieve a suspenseful spark of hope when all has been lost. Having made the adjustments to the new faces, new looks and expansive new ideas, Battlestar Galactica has become a fully developed, sometimes awe-inspiring spectacle that again raises the bar a few notches above where it was lifted by those wonderful stories of a few years ago. This is the best science fiction television, ever.	5.0	Television Science-Fiction All Grown Up.	2005-12-23	8	7	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3LKA6MECRIZCR	Ron Suliteanu	"I watched the mini-series and when it was over I thought to myself, ""Maybe it only gets good with the actual episodes..."" After the 3rd episode, I had to force myself to keep watching, since I had paid actual money for this. To put it bluntly, this show sucks pretty bad. What are you 5-Star reviewers thinking?The really serious problems are the script (particularly around the Cylons), the character development and the acting.The cast uniformly looks like they're acting (which is a sign of bad acting). Not a single character is believable as a real person. It's sooooo cliche - each character has a one-dimensional role: leader, warrior, tough girl, crazy genius, beautiful siren, angry drunk, etc.  The consisteny of the bad acting makes me think that maybe it's the director's fault.The second big problem is with the script. The Cylons are incomprehensible!!  First they blow up humanity with nukes, then they relentlessy attack the BSG fleet. Okay. From there on, the Cylons get ""subtle""...What is with the human Cylons? They're not robots that look human. They're not androids with tubes and yucky fluid. They're EXACTLY like us, except for some wierd trace minerals in their blood?  Not only do they also THINK exactly as we do , but apparently they're highly religious to boot!  And get this: they can breed with us!  Are we supposed to believe that the dumb robots from 40 years ago ""built"" humans?  Even though they are 99.99% like us, the BSG crew has no trouble torturing and killing them as they say, ""You're just software.""It just makes no sense.A few more things that just really don't cut it:They use the old ""NYPD Blues"" Un-Steady Cam - my daughter walked in and within one minute said, ""Why is the picture shaking like that?""  Very distracting and not ""edgy"" at all.Dr. Baltar and his imaginary Cylon friend. I found this to be the single dumbest part of the show. He has an implant in his brain (which he apparently wants to keep), that allows him to see (and make love to) the blonde bombshell. She can even smack him into a wall... quite an implant.A female StarBuck that punches out superior officers, smokes cigars, plays ""poker"" with the boys, and cackles a lot... oh please.The absolutely dumb interactions between the Commander and the President. In fact just about everything to do with the President and her ""government"" (which is composed of her and the whacky genius as VP) is irritating.The new and improved robot Cylons look pretty good, but they're wimps!  I don't remember them taking out a single human and one or two shots from a hangun and they're done!The only parts of the show that I think are above expectations are the special effects and the set designs. Beautiful, well detailed sets and the space scenes are top notch.The bottom line is this: if you can watch it for free on SciFi, go ahead - it has a moment here and there. No way is it worth spending money on."	2.0	Very disappointing!	2005-10-04	43	27	16

It is an intelligent show and has one of the most complicated plots I have ever seen.  There are many plots, sub-plots, and plot twists with many things that are yet to be revealed.  It is almost nothing like the original series back in the 70's except for the core plotline.  And personally, I thought the original sucked.  I am also very impressed with the amount of research they put into the military way of life and military terminology and how they adapted it to fit the show.  Plus all the women are really hot.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1IVVRB62XH2DE	Rory C. L. Blyth	"You know that feeling when you have high expectations about a date with some gorgeous woman who, for reasons well beyond your understanding of the universe, seems to want you?Then, the night comes, and she's a no-show.This has never happened to me, though I expect it's happened to plenty of you, and it probably sucks.On a Saturday night when I *should* have been in the company of someone whose company I didn't deserve, I ditched all normal social activities to go to Borders just before they closed. I grabbed Razor and the Season One HD-DVD set.Razor? Awesome.HD-DVD Season One? As others have already pointed out, the content is, of course, great. I doubt many of us would be here reviewing this thing if the content of the original broadcasts/DVD wasn't all very special and spectacular and other complimentary words that begin with ""s"".Unlike others, I don't mind the packaging. Life is long enough to give up long stretches of time to watch the entire series start to finish at least half a dozen times, but life it much too short to be worrying about ""flimsy"" packaging. If you're willing to spend tens of dollars on an HD-DVD set, then you could also shell out a few extra for a little DVD case just for the show. Anyway, when you *do* have that gorgeous woman over, the last thing you want her to see is that you own as much BSG as they sell, including two copies of Season One. This is in addition to the whole of Farscape, Stargate SG-1, and Stargate Atlantis that you must hide as well.Frankly, I see the packaging, if defective at all, as a great reason to get my indolent little body out the door to buy products with which to hide my fascination with things that are snubbed by the social snobs of this planet because there's some freaking outer-space involved. The show isn't even sci-fi - it's a drama set in space where characters and situations can be pushed in directions unavailable to more conventional shows. It might be odd if, say, a Viper popped in for a low fly-by over The Love Boat. Probably wouldn't work.But I'm getting off-topic. Point is, the packaging, unless it *is* a problem when it comes to scratching, is a non-event when it comes to enjoyment of the show. It's not like you're going to sit down and watch a box. If you do like to watch boxes, then you might not be the show's demographic. (I'm not convinced that damaged discs are a widespread problem, by the by, as the people who have bad experiences with a product (like me) tend to speak up more often than those who don't - I don't mean to discount the complaints - just to suggest that there are also those of us who had no problems at all with the packaging as it relates to scratches on the discs).The biggest problem here, and I think this is the thing getting to all of us, is that the HD-DVD transfer isn't much better than the DVD. There were scenes that definitely looked better - I have this thing about Adama's shoes, in that they're the coolest shoes on television (as is the cut of the legs of his trousers), and I was able to freeze-frame my way to shoe-y satisfaction (they look like a modified pair of Tod's for those who're interested).I've watched the whole of Season One in just about every easily accessible medium out there. Saw a few on TV, though I hate watching TV, so I didn't spend too much time in it. Grabbed the episodes in other ways at the time - not the greatest quality (particularly the mini-series), but the story takes priority over any of that.Watched it in formats meant for a large screen, for a portable device, from iTunes (always awful), on DVD, and so on. It never looked all that great.Now that I've watched this version, I'm starting to think it has nothing to do with the medium - it's the show's style. They simply wanted that grainy look. I don't know anything about production, so I apologize if these assertions are grossly off the mark, but given how limited a budget these people have to work with, and given how quickly they have to crank out these shows, is it possible that they only rendered the live action scenes with the expectation that their primary release formats would be standard broadcast 480i?I say this because the space scenes look beautiful. ""The Hand of God"" is a fine example - their so much clearer and detailed that the terrain of the planetoid thing actually looks quite fake. The rest of the FX are gorgeous, and I'm not someone who seeks perfection, so I kicked back and enjoyed with the whole of my capacity to enjoy a show/movie.The Vipers look amazing - the colors stand out, and details I'd always wanted to see more clearly, such as Kara's rescue of Lee by ramming him all the way back to Galactica (*that's* love, by the way), are evident. More than others, those are the scenes I watched over and over.In general, as I said, the space scenes are exceptional. Watch the standard here's-the-Galactica shots, and you'll see the difference. This is another reason I think the live action scenes are intentionally grainy and unrefined, although I stick by my suggestion that it could also be a budget issue. Rendering video is profoundly time-consuming and expensive - HD-DVD is a new format that most consumers aren't going to get into yet. So, would it have been worth it to have ""fixed"" the live action scenes? To us, yes, but had that been a requirement, I doubt we'd have anything at all.Some of you are bringing up other HD-DVD transfers - Heroes, for example. When watching the two shows, I think it's evident that there are tremendous stylistic differences. Heroes, as far as live action scenes go, is an ordinarily lit and shot bit of work. Filters, color correction, blah blah blah - in a way, because of its style, and even if it's on a small scale, every shot of BSG is an FX shot.I don't know. Maybe we have to make allowances there.In the end, despite being a quality-apologist for the quality, I don't feel this set delivers. There are HD-DVD transfers from the 60s on (see 2001? it's mind-boggingly lovely) that look far better than this.I expect Razor to look just as good as other HD-DVD endeavors, as the show already looks great on the standard DVD (the attack on the shipyards as well as the escape of the Pegasus are... yeah - *that's* some good stuff), but I don't think, unless they re-release Season One way down the line, that we're going to get the HD experience we want anytime soon.If you already own Season One on DVD, there's little reason to pick this up. I'm an addict, which means that I have little control over what I spend on BSG products, as feeding an addiction isn't a rational thing, so I'd still buy it regardless of the reviews (including my own) - I just don't think other people are going to dig it.I guess I also support purchasing this set because I want as much money as possible to get in the hands of these people to demonstrate how unbelievably awesome this show is - the best thing ever made for movies/television alike. Hopefully we'll see quality transfers in the future based on dough and popularity. If they follow the George Lucas model of releasing a new set of each season every time they so much as pretty up a scene in the head, I'll shell out whatever they charge.This may seem odd given my disappointment with the work done here, but... like I said, I'm an addict. My approval of this product is disconnected from my satisfaction.I'd been waiting for that gorgeous woman, and she never came.Even worse, she sent her ugly cousin instead.Unless you can't control yourself, in which case none of these reviews will matter anyway, and unless you want to support the cause, don't bother.Here's to hoping they do the remaining seasons and Razor in such a way that our whining is reduced to that expected pocket of hecklers who are congenitally unable to enjoy *anything*."	1.0	I feel like I just got stood up...	2007-12-22	17	5	12
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"How I missed this show until this year, I will never know.  But I've made up for lost time.  Unoriginal, and with not the greatest of production values or the most epic characters, the new BSG is still an epic surprise.The new show returns to the basics - human and cylon exist in an uncomfortable peace.  With the help of Baltar, the robotic cylons betray mankind and virtually annihilate all but about 45,000 humans.  The survivors miss the genocide by being in space at the time.  The remaining ships form a ragtag fleet headed to the only conceivable destination - the lost planet of earth.There it ends.  I'll put aside the obvious changes (Boomer and Starbuck are women?  Col. Tigh looks to have been changed as well) for the deeper ones.  The Cylons ARE smart.  The walking toasters of the old show are history (literally - in an early scene, we see s few behind glass in a museum).  Instead, we have armies of fast moving (CGI) soldiers, and a higher level of autonomous machines that look, sound and feel human.  There are no specifics, but these cylons are manmade - at some point they rebelled and, by the advent of this story, they've evolved.  Unaware of the humanoid Cylons, the garden variety are infamous for being able to infect computers.  As a result, ships like Galactica are deliberately un-tech.  (If you've been to one of those old warships turned into a museum, you know what I mean.)  Baltar is still a traitor, but a different kind - the aknowledged master genius of humanity, his treason is unwitting.  He's fallen victim to Six, a humanoid Cylon who only resembles a beautiful woman.  By the time he's realized his mistake, the Cylons have nuked all human worlds.  Brought to the fleet by human beings unaware of Baltar's treachery, Baltar is manipulated by the Cylons who implant Six directly into his brain.  The humans have less dimension than the Cylons, but that's the appeal of the show - they aren't weakly drawn characters, but strongly drawn characters of weak people.  Most of the appeal of the show is trying to guess how these unheroic human beings will out think the race of cylon super thinkers without destroying each other in the process.  Among the human beings, the factions split between the military, led by Col. Adama (Olmos) and the surviving politicians led by Laura Roslin (McDonnel) - constantly at odds, but able to join up against threats from the Cylons and from within.  Trying not to get caught by either side, but also trying not to fall for Cylon manipulation, Baltar navigates an uneasy path.  the shows are serial - following the crew as they evade massive Cylon attacks and more subtle and insidious strategies.  (An example of this would be in "":33"" - in which the fleet finds itself beset by a devestating Cylon attack every 33 minutes.This is a great show.  The menace of the Cylons manages to flesh out a tight story of humans under pressure.  Set design seems less plausible now then the dirty-old-ship look of 1978, but the camera movements, the forever tense humans who look ill-placed for their roles, and the enigma of the Cylons keep the story rising above sets.  Space battles are fantastic - CGI finally done right for a TV show.  The dialog sounds natural - people actually speak like people, rather than the clinically inhuman action-figures of the latter Trek shows.  The dangers of space travel, the insidious genius of the Cylons, and the inadequacy of the protagonists combine to keep this show on the edge.  Forget ""Enterprise"" - this is what a science-fiction show should look like."	4.0	This is what great sci-fi looks like on TV	2005-07-28	59	52	7
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1BX91VU1Y7R78	"R. Page ""af_sting"""	"The new BSG series is a dark and serious show with little of the swashbuckling laughs of the old 1970's version.  Never-the-less, it's well-made and has an intriguing take on the same events as the old show.  My one problem is that, like any remake, the directors and producers seem bent on remaking everything.  There are some things I'd have rather seen unchanged, but these directors have to be original (odd when they are ""remaking"" a show).  Also, read into it what you will, but it's simply a TV show; parallels between it and today's world (9/11, etc) I believe are just a cinematic technique for drawing in the viewer.

Whatever you will end up calling it, it will remain ingrained in your memory for the rest of your lifetime. Often called a ""Space Opera"", this is a show that not only show cases some incredible CGI cut sequences, it has brilliant actors and actresses, all who play extremely believable representations of humans just like us...but they don't have a home. They barely have any hope. They barely have resources to survive. And all the while, they are being tracked by a ""species""(if you will) much more intelligent. A ""species"" that is on a quest for revenge. This group of battered humans, reminiscent of the Mass Effect's Quarians and their ""Migrant Fleet"", struggle every day to survive, on their way to a potential new place to call home. The mystical Earth, read about throughout the ages in various prophecies. A place were long lost brethren can be found. A safe haven. It's there only hope for survival. But can they hold the fleet together long enough to make it across the vast galaxy to our planet? WATCH TO SEE!!There are moments of joy, moments of sorrow, and moments of disbelief. For techies, there are vast galaxies, planets completely void of life and planets simply teeming with it; space-bearing ships, silent behemoths that float through the vastness of space, never making a noise; cybernetic beings, who have taken the likeness of humans. For religious people, there are moments of polytheism, monotheism, atheism, and agnosticism, as humans and cylons alike question what their purpose is in this chain of events. For men and women who live their lives following a code, such as our armed forces, there are more than enough sequences completely dedicated to the hundreds of military personnel in the human fleet. Or perhaps your someone who is enthralled with the tough decisions made by people who follow a less clear code, people take a large stake in our worlds political forum, there are literally whole episodes dedicated to politics and the hard choices that a few are left to shoulder. There is no doubt in my mind that just about anyone could get sucked into this show. The plight of people just like you and me portrayed in this show is intoxicating.Why else would another TV show dedicate part of an episode to how addictive this show is? ([...]) THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU!!Anyways, to wrap up, I just have to say you are doing yourself a disservice if you have Netflix or Amazon Prime and you are not going to watch this show. There is a REASON why it's on all the Top Show lists put out by different websites.Now stop reading my review and start WATCHING!!

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1K5J4ITEBJZ7T	R. Raborn	"Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined version that was released in 2003, I find to be a gritty, gripping, and stylish foray into what I'd like to call ""Hard Science Fiction"" that I simply can't get enough of.  I was very skeptical when I first heard about the project and what the proposed changes were but I gave it a chance and it has blown me away.  It has its weak moments as most shows do but in my opinion its strong moments vastly outnumber them.  It isn't glitzy, it doesn't rely upon fancy weapons and overly fancy technology it just uses existing tech and extends it out into a very believable environment.  It is hard to pin down ""when"" Galactica is taking place as I don't believe they've ever really stated it but given that they are using ""nukes"" or ""radiologicals"" and attitude adjusting jets on their fighter craft, it just adds a bit of a grounding to our reality like it is an extension from Earth in some way and makes it seem plausible.Character development is quite good which a diverse set of people to attach yourself to and the storyline as a whole seems to be developing rather well with a good plot and subplots mixed in.I cannot complain about this new release.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something that isn't glossed up like Andromeda, or Star Trek, or some of the other Sci-Fi series out there.  Galactica as I stated previously is a hard-hitting, in-your-face, no-nonsense show that tackles issues in a realistic way and they do it with a minimalist mind set.  In my opinion it is very worth a look."	5.0	Galactica - Season 1	2006-03-20	0	0	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1ZIIC262XVX19	Russ	Watch it!! This overhauled version of the late 70's TV show is more than meets the eye. In short, it is a fabulously well produced psychological drama that happens to take place in space.After watching the original mini series in 2003, before the series was made, I was flat-out depressed at the frank portrayal of humanness in the characters. Of course, though, the dark side of humanness is what drives us to watch the things we watch.Shot with a hand-held, documentary style (even in the space scenes), the flawed characters, solid story arc, and sub-plots all lend a hand in making the new Battlestar Galactica an intriguing, powerful drama. Even if you're not a fan of space shows like Star Trek, give this one a whirl and you'll be surprised.Have a few beers and enjoy.	5.0	Watch it	2007-02-19	0	0	0

Finally producers, writers, and actors work together to provide something fresh and new rather than a producer-driven reality show.The only other show in tv history that is comparable to the potential this show has was the original Star Trek.

When I heard it was coming back, I was excited, until I heard it wasn't really coming back but was being reimagined.  I didn't have cable or satellite during the days of the re-imagined &#34;Galatica&#34;, so it was only recently that--thanks to Amazon Prime--I got to see the show.It's a mixed bag.  It's an enjoyable sci-fi show with nods to the old but--this is my personal opinion and may reflect mostly that I was 13 in 1978--there is no aspect of this show that is an improvement on the old show except, maybe, the fact that the special effects are less repetitive.  I prefer all the characters from the old show to their newer counterparts and I like the way the old-show approached everything with, IMHO, just a hint of tongue-in-cheek.  It was space opera and they knew it.That being said, I did enjoy most of this first season of the new &#34;Galactica&#34;.  It starts off well, with a good pilot movie that establishes all the characters and sucks you in.  The season ended with a bang and three or four top-notch episodes that got me interested in season 2.  The problem was the middle section of season 1.  I thought many of those episodes were rather plodding and almost drove me to abandon the show entirely.All this drove me to purchase the original series from Amazon and, as I watch it on my Kindle Fire, it makes me wish they had been able to go on a few more years.

I'm not sure why so many BSG fans on this site want to say it isnt so. They seem bent on denying the American influence on the series. Ron Moore stated: ""At the script stage in the pilot, I got a note back from the top of the network supporting the referrences to September 11, the War on Terror and al-Qaeda, and encouraging me to take it further"" and ""The mini series was informed by a lot of 9/11 memories, 911 feelings, and the series continues on that route. This series is definitely about this time and place in America"". Let's be understanding towards those who don't feel comfortable with very real tragedy tossed in with space ships while the wounds are still fresh.

They say that people who notice the influence of real events on the series are 'sad' and 'idiots'. Why are such fans bent on hiding the social commentary of the series? I suspect it's because that's the weakest part of the series. Denying the references doesn't help. Moore says he wants references to Iraq and 9/11 in the series. The series does contain social commentary. Moore points those things out in his podcasts and articles. So now Moore is sad and an idiot?

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AJ7SBFCIXPJM1	"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson"""	"I have to start off by saying this--I HATED THE ORIGINAL SERIES.  It was a cheesy rip-off of Star Wars, and I was dismissive of it's fans to the point that I used to say that ""fans of BSG couldn't fork out the five dollars to go see Star Wars"".  So, I went in prepared to be disappointed...and lost it about two minutes into the miniseries when Tricia Helfer walked between the toasters.What Ron Moore wrought in his vision of the series was very much an overall coarser vision of the original premise--the pressures on the fleet, the political and military leaders, and how the series is shot--more of a haphazard jumping, especially in the battle sequences.  One of the special features in the Season One set is a discussion of how Moore wanted a documentary feel in the battle sequences, I believe; and this effect is accomplished.  Plus, this is a series that, to a certain extent, makes the viewer's religious beliefs somewhat uncomfortable because of the human's beliefs in the Lords of Kobol while the Cylons hold to monotheism.But it is the actors and their performances that gave the miniseries it's jumpstart to being beyond something beyond the original series, and the storyline that takes this way beyond the original.  There cannot be enough said about Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell at the top of the cast--Olmos does an interesting turn on his William Adama; partially reviving the cool of his Martin Castillo from his Miami Vice days while adding the heart of a father dealing with an awkward relationship with his son--one ends up noting that Adama will treat Starbuck more like his family at times than he does Apollo.  McDonnell's Laura Roslin--the Education Minister turned President of the colonies when the 42 ahead of her are taken out in the Cylon's attack--does the evolvement into the leader (while dying of cancer) role with her usual stunning and understated grace, plus one can see the attraction Roslin and Adama hold for each other.The uniqueness of this series has been how it pairs off characters.  For example, Lee Adama and Kara Thrace aren't a true couple in the sense of the term but they are designed to play off each other, and Jamie Bamber and Katee Sackhoff do this very well.  Of course, this is incredibly important given the revision of Starbuck from a trash-talkin', hard-drinkin', hard-lovin' cigar-smokin' male in the original to a trash-talkin', hard-drinkin', hard-lovin' cigar-smokin' female; a character that Sackhoff captures both with arrogance and vulnerability.  There's Helo and Boomer--Karl Agathon falling for Sharon Valeri, but Sharon not knowing that she's a ""skin job"".  So much of the male/female dynamic is role reversal on this series, and while Tammoh Penikett plays the hunky Agathon, it's Grace Park who steals this coupling as the confused, paranoid Boomer.Then, of course there's the magnificent James Callis--and his paranoid, uncertain Gaius Baltar; the unwitting conspirator in the Cylon's attack of the Twelve Colonies--and the lush, haunting Tricia Helfer.  Forget that Helfer is gorgeous (Then again, DON'T forget that).  It is Number Six--the mistress of espionage, murderer of babies in their strollers, the image (?) haunting Baltar at various moments--who just steals the whole show at times.One cannot dismiss the secondary players in this, either--Michael Hogan's Saul Tigh--the functioning alcoholic who is perfect as Adama's second in command, Alessandro Juliani's Gaeta, Kandyse McClure's Dee Douala...I suppose that--if I go back to the beginning, and remember my premise for hating the original--that what Ron Moore and David Eick have done with the series is took a premise that was basically good (but haphazardly thrown together in the late 1970s), reworked the idea, and gave it a deeper and stronger foundation.  They strengthened the drama (Of course the idea of having certain models of the Cylons look human is cheesy in thought--BUT IT WORKS BETTER THAN ANY OF US THOUGHT).  They strengthed the characters.  Moore and Eick took a house that looked good on the outside but didn't have an originally well-grounded foundation, ripped out everything inside the house and reset the foundation...and put together something stunning."	5.0	The Brilliance Of Gallactica	2007-03-15	4	4	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	"I am a huge fan of the original Battlestar Galactica (see my review), but I have to tell you that this re-invention of the series is nearly as good as science fiction gets.If you want state-of-the-art flying/combat sequences, realistic drama, and realistic characters then this could be the series for you.  It really doesn't matter if you don't like science fiction.  Space is simply the back-drop.  The power of the show is in its story and characters.I've said it time and time again, a show is as good as its writing.  I don't care how good the actors are, if the story is weak, then the rest simply doesn't matter.  And here, the stories are strong and fresh.The old Battlestar Galactica was set further in the future, in some ways.  The fighters had lasers as well as the hand-weapons.  The battlestar itself looked more futuristic.  But here, the vipers fire bullets as do the hand-weapons.  In a lot of ways this gives the audience something that is more relatable.Star Wars was a series with an outline on the spiritual which is evident in the Jedi.  It is set in the far future with technology to match.  Star Trek is a series about exploration, not only of the stars, but of oneself.  The original Battlestar Galactica harbored a sort of mystical/mythological quality to it.  This new Battlestar Galactica is able to put realism in science fiction.  And it does this better than anything else to date.  This is why the new Battlestar Galactica, even though it uses the original series as a template, is revolutionizing the way science fiction is done.Where the technology in the Star Wars and Star Trek universes bordered on the mind-blowing (transporters, lightsabers, phasers, photon torpedoes, ion cannons, etc.) the science in Battlestar is sound.  The writers make sure that it is something that can be done before they incorporate it into the series.  For the first time ever, we see ships fly in space the way they WOULD fly.  Vipers using thrusters to make hard turns, move up and down, and use all dimensions of space indicates this.I like this new series also because they have made the new Battlestar Galactica their own.  Thankfully, they didn't try to copy the original.  The writers and Ronald Moore obviously understand that each show depends on the period of time in which is was shown.  Therefore, what is the point in copying it?The characters here are terrific.  Edward James Olmos is fantastic is Commander William Adama.  Adama has an edge to him.  Don't expect the grandfatherly approach that you may have been used to seeing from Lorne Greene.  This Adama doesn't take anything from anyone.  He's clearly in charge.  The Galactica is a military ship, and he isn't afraid to push is authority, even in the face of President Roslin.Jamie Bamber is a good Captain Apollo.  The original Apollo (Richard Hatch) could come across a bit too preachy sometimes.  Captain Apollo here is a young man who has a tough relationship with Adama.  He's put in a difficult position as a liaison between Adama and Roslin.  He is also unaware of how he really feels about Starbuck.  He's tough but principled.  Apollo, much like the original portrayal, is about doing the right thing.Katee Sackhoff has the most controversial role of anyone in the series aside from possibly Grace Park as Boomer.  The creators decided to make Starbuck a woman.  Why not?  Isn't it feasible that women would be serving in this capacity in a future civilization?  And Sackhoff is right: nobody can duplicate Dirk Benedict's performance, so why try?  Instead she's made Lt. Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace her own.  And she's simply wonderful.  Here, it's clear she's the best pilot by far.  In the original series, it was never so cut-and-dry.  ""She's the best I've ever seen,"" Adama says.  She's tempermental and a bit of a rogue.  She doesn't get along with Colonel Tigh at all, and she has a history with Zac, Apollo's younger brother who was killed.  Starbuck is brilliant as a tactician as well.One of my favorites is James Callis as the brilliant Dr. Gaius Baltar.  Baltar isn't the evil character from the original.  He's a man who is obsessed with satisfying his own needs and desires, and he'll do anything to get them.  He isn't evil.  He's troubled.  He's constantly plagued by the hallucinary form of the Cylon known as ""Number Six"" (Tricia Helfer) who more or less steers his conscience.  Callis give Baltar a likeable charm and makes it apparent as to why he's so likeable among the Galactica crew.Grace Park is great as Lt. Sharon ""Boomer"" Valeri.  This was controversial because she's a woman as well.  Even more controversial is that she's a Cylon.  And yet this twist gives the show some real flavor!  The Galactica is in more trouble than people think as they have to deal with Cylons looking and acting like real humans!  They have to be on the look out for sabotages, and the real surprise comes in the last episode of this season that will have to running to the store to get season 2!I also really like having Mary McDonnell as President Roslin.  She's always played her roles in film as soft, nurturing women, but with real strength.  As the former Secretary of Education, it is unclear if she can take the helm of the fleet and work with Adama in holding the fleet together.Supporting members of the cast are just as good such as Michael Hogan as Colonel Tigh, Tahmoh Penikett as ""Helo,"" and Tricia Helfer as ""Number Six.""This series is gritty with language, sex, and violence.  The ships don't go to light speed but actually ""jump"" from one location to another, even though this takes tremendous power and fuel to do.One of the best episodes, and they are all good, is ""33"" in which the Cylons are somehow finding the Galacica's location every 33 minutes.The Cylons are cooler too.  In the original series, they always got blown apart pretty easily.  Not here.  Even one Cylon Raider is more than a match for several Viper pilots.  Also, the Cylon Raiders are ""alive"" without pilots, thus funtioning on their own.  The writers have made them formidable, so that when you hear that Cylons are coming, you worry because they are more dangerous then ever depicted before.  This is especially true of the clones that are made to look/act human.  How the Galactica and her crew deal with the paranoia that ""anyone"" could be a Cylon is a fun angle to work with.All in all, this is one heck of a series.  It's the Sci-Fi channels highest rated show of all time.  That says something.  And as good as the miniseries was, the episodes are even better!  And if the following seasons are just as good, if not better, then that is why this could very well be one of the best science fiction series ever.So, if you're a fan of great writing as well as a compelling back-drop in space, hang on, because this is one of the best rides in television history.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	APFGCJKDKQ5KS	Sf luver	"Battlestar Galactica was, for me, one of those shows you have to watch a lot to get into. I'm a big sci-fi fan (I've been watching Star Trek, Stargate, and Farscape for years), so BSG was a natural next step. I was a little turned off my it originally. I thought the plots where dry, the characters were just plain silly, and the gray filters made me very depressed.But I stuck to it. I thought, ""Hey! I just bought this season for a lot of movie, might as well watch it all."" And I did, and after that I also purchased Season 2.0 (which is better than Season 1 in my opinion).Battlestar seems to be something you either hate or love. I love it. It's a very character driven show, so if all you like are a lot of action and aliens, you're out of luck (though it a VERY fast-paced show). It's a science fiction drama, and a very good one. It combines philosophy and existentialism with tense situations and fabulous characters that play off of each other very well.A five star show no doubt. : )"	5.0	Absolutely Fantastic--but I didn't always think so	2006-03-21	3	2	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3S68DSZLDF3YC	Shannon Davis	"Okay, so I seriously tried to watch BSG while it was on SciFi, in the first season, but I could never get into it.  I didn't understand it, everyone else that liked all the same shows I did loved it.  I was completely lost.  The black sheep of the group.  So, I just put it off as that I didn't like the show.During my writer's workshop, my teacher suggested that I watch the show.  I'm working on a young adult novel that takes place on a starship and he wasn't sure what feel it had.  To be honest, I wasn't quite sure either.  So, I was like 'what to heck, I'll just buy the first season on Amazon since it's so cheap.'  Really, how many of us are able to watch a series from Blockbuster?  I think it ends up costing the same anyways.The Mini Series was the KEY.I had started to watch AFTER the Mini Series, when I tried to watch it on TV.The Mini Series sets us up for the whole show.  We are thrown into a not too distant future in which a ship, a Battlestar, is being decommissioned and turned into a musuem.  The war with the Cylons (a race of machines that humans created) seems to be over since we humans haven't seen them for decades.  All is at peace.  The Battlestar in question is the Galactica.The Cylons had been busy creating humanoid creations of themselves.  They look exactly like humans.  They end up attacking all of the Twelve Colonies without warning.  Civilization as the human race knows it is pretty much wiped out.The Galactica ends up putting together a fleet of ships that they link up with, among these ships is a ship carrying the surviving member of the presidential cabinet that now takes over as the new president of the twelve colonies, originally just the secretary of education.This fleet is commanded by Commander William Adama and seconded by Colonel Saul Tigh.  These two commanders are old friends and have an interesting relationship.  Adama knows how to keep the constantly drunk Tigh under control, he only had joined since it was going to be their last tour.  This command team is in charge of a mix-matched group of people.  They are not the only ones in command, though, there is also the new president of the Twelve Colonies, President Laura Roslin.Though there are many bumps between military and civilian authority, the fleet moves on no matter what defending by their Viper and Raptor pilots.  We see a lot of these characters.  Lee ""Apollo"" Adama being one of the most prominant and outrightly so in the first season as we see how his relationship with his father evolves along with his rocky relationship with ""Starbuck.""  He sides with President Roslin and puts himself into a deeper hole with his father even though he does not see it as taking a side.  Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace is a hotshot Viper pilot who drinks and smokes too much.  She's seen as a daughter by Commander Adama.  Other pilots we also see are: Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii and Karl ""Helo"" Agathon.The first season takes us back to Caprica, one of the Twelve Colonies that was fired upon by the Cylons, as ""Helo"" chooses to stay there after his and ""Boomer""'s Raptor has to land there for repairs.  They take on refugees and he makes the choice to stay behind so that Doctor Gaius Baltar can go back to the Galatica.The future that BSG takes place in is not one that has been perfected at all.  There is still cancer and there are still different ways to go about treating it.  People still drink and smoke and do things they know are wrong.  The characters are all flawed, though this is what makes them so realistic and human.  They have to strive for the survival of the human race."	5.0	The Mini Series is the Key	2009-08-22	1	1	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1JCAP7JQY8QU7	Sharonda B	Battlestar Galactica isn't for everybody. Some reviewers insist that we should be blind followers of NEWSDAY, TIME, and TV WITHOUT PITY. Following only what the critcs say is a fool's game. TV WITHOUT PITY gives Six Feet Under good reviews while NEWSDAY doesn't. What do all the zombies who just follow these reviews do then?Another person stated that TIME considers Battlestar Galactica to be a top ten show, but TIME did NOT consider it good enough for their best of TV top ten list for 2004. Previously TIME even included the O.C. on the 2003 BEST list as the number 5 best show!Speaking of the O.C., I noticed that TV WITHOUT PITY has often given episodes of the O.C. higher ratings than Battlestar Galactica. So have vistors to that site. Does that mean the zombies who only follow these sources like the O.C. more than Battlestar while attacking those who don't like Battlestar for being less sophisticated and brainy? It would seem the issue would really be a matter of soap fans versus those who may not like soaps.Critics shouldn't dictate what you like. Make your own decisions on what you like instead of following what the critics tell you. Not everybody likes this show and that's okay. Some people aren't soap fans. I'm not.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2S32G7LVQ55RN	Shawn Steinbach	"As a fourteen year old boy in 1979 Battlestar Galactica was a major television step forward for sci-fi fans. Prior to the Star Wars premiere in the theatres you were considered a little ""warped"" to watch anything science fiction related, so serious prime time sci-fi tv shows were far and few between. I say 'serious' because most sf shows were on the comedic side, such as Quark, (who remembers that show?).The new Sci-Fi channel original series Battlestar Galactica carries with it even greater impact for me as an adult than did the original those many years ago. I thought it would be a kick to see an update of the show but was completely unprepared for the visually realistic and innovativness of the way the show is being done. I expected technically advanced special effects such as what the modern Star Treks have offered, but scenes are often shot in such a way as to suggest it was being filmed out on the front line like a news report from Iraq. You are really seeing Colonial Vipers in action, shot with a handheld camera from a vantage point from another ship. Or so it would seem.Not to imply a show with innovative effects makes great tv, but add to the fact these stories never fail to leave you on the edge and have better continuity than most sf tv. It's not just a plot device to get a show about space, but you relly feel these are refugees fleeing from a terrorist enemy ironically of their own creation. I would like to give thumbs up especially to whoever cast the show. The acting and the actors themselves are first rate.I liked BSG in 1979 and tried to catch it whenever it aired. I DON'T MISS an episode of this series. It is simply the best show on tv today. Truly easier to aprieciate on DVD, season one is worth every penny and includes the 2003 miniseries as well.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3W1RLL461CMCT	Sir Lancelot	"Alright, it's late, it's raining and thunder/lightning is flashing on occasion out the window here in L.A.So, for the first time I can remember, I've joined this forum to comment on something. And I've been reading these things for awhile.I'm a filmmaker, working occasionally, at home trying to write these past days, and for some reason, tonight as the thunder and lighting crash outside my window, I feel like talking about Battlestar Galactica.I'm 33 years old and almost embarrased to admit it. Not because i'm old, but because as a kid, I was hopelessly addicted to the original BSG when it first came out. I had the plastic viper that shot the little red thing and the cylon ship that did the same but in tandem.I was a fan of the show then, because it was cool. I knew it wasn't perfect, (Boxy?) but a viper is just too cool, and what's better for a kid to think about than humanity's desperate trek toward a shining, distant orb known only as Earth?But then I grew up and moved on. I started to like more complex things, even though i never truly lost my love for all things cool. But, Ron D. Moore and company recognized that the fans of that show had grown up, and it was the smartest realization they could have made.BSG is for grown up kids that want something deeper than they've been getting on t.v., especially genre t.v.To me, Battlestar Galactica has become what Star Wars Ep I, II, and III should have been, oh if only could have been! It's become something real, that makes it's audience think, and feel even as it's characters do, it is about real things and issues whether you care about these things or not, and it still kicks arse at the same time.It is not about gadgets and CGI and only cool things although it excels at them without trying.It's about humanity, about the great journey we all undertake, like it or not, as we discover what it means to be human, in all our flawed, pathetic glory.It is a show about persevering through the impossible, about stumbling at our moments of triumph, about laughing in the face of our own destruction.This show speaks more to me about religion, politics and the human spirit than I ever found in Sunday school or CNN.It gets down and dirty when other shows in it's genre get high and mighty.In episodes like ""Flesh and Blood"" it talks of humanity's ablility to marginalize and idolize and demonize, and fear, and overcome fear with faith and hard work, without preaching or even appearing to teach. When Adama says, ""No"" to Leoben's corpse, whilst looking as if he may just brain the corpse for fun, you know this is a man with such fire, he will never give in and he is too human to give up even though everything says he probably should.There is true wisdom at the heart of this show, it's tapped in to some universal sense of honesty and truth I only can hint at. In ""33"", perhaps the finest bit of t.v. I've seen yet, (not that I've seen it all) we can see ourselves in the decisions these characters must make at a moment's notice, decisions that can save 49,000 lives even as they may destoy a 1,000, but at what cost? At what cost do we lose our souls and become the cylon menace we fear?BSG tells us more than Fox or CNN about why we are in Iraq and Afganistan and why we find it so easy to shut off our emotions at some times or to be overcome by them at others.One man's terrorist is another man's hero, just ask Richard Hatch's amazing character. Indeed, every character is a gem,large or small, and in fact some of my favorites, like Chief Tyrol, were only meant as minor parts. A drunken XO? A sexually liberated viper pilot that smokes cigars and flips her superiors off? Cylons with souls that envy and love?It is more like Alphaville than Stargate. It is a testament to truly the best writing on the most consistant level since the original Twilight Zone that every character succeeds so well and is so... fracking human.I often think in watching this show, back to how ridiculed Rod Serling was after leaving his Emmy Winning Playhouse 90 for a 'cheesy little' sci-fi show called ""The Twilight Zone"". Well, I mistakenly thought badly of Edward James Olmos when i first heard he was joining this show, before i knew anything about it. Honestly, at first i stayed away, afraid my beloved childhood memories may be sullied in the same way Star Wars had been for me.But I was proven wrong even just as critics were in the time of Rod Serling. Olmos is a smart, talented man, and so is Ron Moore and David Eick and the others responsible for BSG.They knew that one great way to reach the human heart, was through sci-fi, through flights of fantasy which allow us to look back on ourselves in a new, fresh way.On a weekly basis this show has more heart and soul than probably ninety percent of what Hollywood puts into theaters in a year.Shame on the rest of us in Hollywood for not being brilliant enough to put such reality in our own work. And shame on the Emmys for overlooking such creativity this year.But then, as I sit here at almost two a.m. now suffering from writers block, writing instead about this show I love, I have to admit, to do such things as BSG is not easy, as no good writing or execution of writing to film ever is. I know this to be true.This show should be supported in every way and I only hope that someday I get to visit the set, because really... the chicks are hot, and I just want to sit in a viper, just once for old times sake.Cause afterall, when you get past the deeper elements and want something to simply to kick ass, well this show does it and how, and a viper is just too damn cool, ain't it?Edited by Lancelotcq2 (09/20/05 06:31 AM)"	5.0	Fracking Brilliant, But Why?	2005-09-20	45	34	11

I would recommend BSG to any sci-fi loving adult.And for women who believe that there was way too much sexism in the casting of major roles during the 1970's, 21st century BSG was a big break from that sexist tradition! All of the cast members did a great job and i was sorry to see the series end. I wish other sci-fi shows had the deep,gritty and robust characters that BSG had...it became what it should have been in the '70s. Sometimes, following a hard act (like star wars) isn't the best approach for a new sci-fi concept. The second generation of BSG was its own &#34;hard act&#34; to follow!	5.0	Done right the second time around!	2014-01-08	0	0	0

Lorenz	Many of the recent SciFi shows fall into two categories: stupid (Voyager, Enterprise, Andromeda) or boring (Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Firefly).It took Ron Moore (a veteran of the greatest SciFi show of all times - Deep Space Nine) to rejuvenate an entire genre.The new Battlestar Galactica is the exact opposite of the old one - it's adult, gritty, dark and sophisticated.It's an intelligent show for intelligent people.With so much garbage on TV today it surprised a lot of people that the best TV show right now comes from a genre that is looked down upon by so many.The ratings are fantastic and the show will be on for a long time - so if you haven't watched it on TV then buy this DVD set.Otherwise you'll be missing the greatest thing on TV right now.	5.0	Best SciFi show since Deep Space Nine	2005-07-24	40	23	17

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A912C7977MO6O	Smallchief	"This five disc package includes (1) the three hour miniseries and (2) the first 13 episodes of Battlestar Galactica.  The miniseries is the quality of a good movie and the episodes which follow are top notch. BG is a well-crafted, adult, serious Scifi series that eschews the hokey and the exotic for down-to-earth tales of human relationships in outer space. (Is that a mixed metaphor or what?)The miniseries tells us of the attack by the man-made cylons on the 12 inhabited worlds of the universe, the utter defeat of man, and the flight of the last remaining 50,000 humans in a rag-tag fleet led by an ancient warship, the Battleship Galactica. Olmos is the captain of the BG; McDonnell is the insignificant politician who becomes the President -- thus the conflict between military and civilian becomes one of the continuing themes.In season one, the Battlestar Galactica searches for planet earth, the legendary thirteenth home of the human race while attempting to avoid the cylons. A premium in this series is placed on acting talent and interpersonal relationships. Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell are superb, seasoned actors and they carry off the lead roles perfectly. The younger actors are equally good; there's not a false note anywhere. ""Number Six"" (Tricia Helfer) adds a generous helping of sex appeal and glamour that is lacking in many Scifi movies. Every character is well-defined.  The sets are good; the action scenes are realistic; the tension is high; and the cliff-hanger endings are often spectacular.Perhaps my enthusiasm is too much -- but BG is my all-time favorite Scifi series. It's a survival story I find credible, touching, and sad.You don't have to be a scifi or action flick fan to like BG -- although there's plenty of both.Now, it's on to see season two of the series. I can hardly wait.Smallchief"	5.0	My favorite TV series	2006-01-28	7	5	2
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3AV2POFIQ7LEY	SoulThief	This review will not recap the story, it will merely discuss why I believe it is worth watching the series now - some years after it was made.I must admit that I was one of those people who was initially disappointed when the new version of Battlestar Galactica hit the screens. For me it demonstrated the darkness of spirit, the greyness of perception, that had gripped the United States at the beginning of the 21st century. It's portrayal of a people feeling betrayed and desperate was too close to home.In 2012 I revisited the DVDs and was able to appreciate the drama. Obviously the mood of the audience impacts the reception of any message, and for me the world is now a brighter place. Therefore I am now able to appreciate the various strands of narrative.The cleverness of the plot is that it mixes a number of different historical and allegorical concepts and then inserts characters who are more three dimensional than is often the case in mini-series. People have flaws and this show revels in some of them. There is more than one human villain, though one is more central, and they don't collude. Good and evil is sometimes an absolute and yet at times relative. As for the cylons, the ultimate villains of the piece, I tend to feel that in season 1 they are more a device (pun intended) to evoke from humans that which makes us human. There is much of a modern take on the morality play about it.As an aside, I also believe the acting is reasonably good and portrays well this human complexity.I recommend taking a look at this once again.	5.0	Better with age	2012-10-04	1	1	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2O0N3QD085AW0	"S. Patel ""reader2"""	I was almost instantly addicted to this series, and I watched episode after episode each evening.  First, I have to say that the premises--the backdrop--were a bit surreal (faster than light space travel, but corded phones, no security cameras, e.g.)  But I actually liked that they simply took 20th century (it didn't seem quite 21st) culture and dumped it into a scenario that included a multi-world federation, civilian space travel, human-clones, etc. It sorta put the background into its true perspective--just that, the box in which the drama takes place.  It created an alternate reality, one that was so close to our present society that we could truly identify. What hooked me was the quality of the characters, the superb acting, the great casting, the truly inspired writing. Yes, some of the over-arching plot-structure was corny, if you tried to separate it out from the multi-layered human dramas that were going on.  But who cares? It was the depth of the characterizations that paid off. Starbuck--wow, what a gem. And the relationship between Commander (Admiral) Adama and Madame President. Perfect casting. Every character developing as the series progresses, making mistakes, sometimes you root for them, sometimes you curse them for their stupidity and arrogance and various human flaws.  I would say the one thing that kind of irritated me was when they persisted in talking about the Cylons as &#34;machines&#34;.  I would have thought they might have struggled a little more with the distinction between 'human' and 'machine', but maybe not--maybe they had to believe that there was this distinction.  In any case, it didn't prevent the viewer from questioning it.  This series raised deep questions--I loved the religious element,, the flawed prophet Baltar, who in spite of himself seemed to say some pretty profound things.  Did anyone take away the question: Who am I? What am I?	5.0	Addictive!	2013-02-27	0	0	0

I purchased the set and found that a couple of the discs had scratches on them, concentric to the disc. I returned to where purchased and they proceeded to open up a series of 4 sets, all with scratches on some discs. Clearly there is some manufacturing problem.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3BKDQS1J9TXCC	S. Sheriff	Given all the buzz this series received, I just had to check it out for myself. With all the positive reviews, I must admit that my expectations were high going into the series. Sadly, the series didn't live up to my hopes.&lt;Full disclosure: I was a young fan of the original TV series. I enjoy sci-fi, but technology and special effects are no substitute for good writing and acting.>This series is very second-rate, even compared to the lower standards which are typically applied to science fiction.The basic premise is lifted from the original series, but the creators have made numerous attempts to introduce twists and turns to generate multiple complex plot lines. Despite the quantity, the various plot elements are often silly, unbelievable or simplistic. As a fan of sci-fi, I am willing and able to suspend disbelief, but Battlestar Galactica never gives me sufficient material to make that leap. The plot(s) doesn't hold up to any basic scrutiny and that's a shame because I always thought that the core premise was a promising basis for a sci-fi thriller.The writing is poor. Characters are simple and shallow. The viewer is continually beat over the head with whatever character flaw or baggage a character is supposed to possess. Characters don't really develop or grow. Additionally, the attempts to incorporate more mature themes (e.g. romantic & platonic relationships, politics, institutional dynamics, religion) are simplistic and one dimensional. This writing will only appeal to an undemanding audience that wants everything spelled out clearly and with minimal ambiguity.The acting is really bad. Edward James Olmos will never be accused of being the world's greatest actor, but he looks like Dustin Hoffman compared to the rest of this cast. The cast is full of newbies and nobodies and they do not impress. It doesn't help that the writing is so bad that the actors have very little with which to work. Even making that allowance, the acting is really bad. Some specific examples? I'll name Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck), Mary McDonnell (President Roslin) and James Callis (Baltar), but I'm probably just picking on them because they have so much more screen time than most of the other performers.Technology has a relatively small role in the series, but I thought the creators did a good job with it. The small nods to the original series were appreciated and the special effects were good for a cable TV series. Costumes and sets were generally good, except for Mary McDonnell's 1970s Farrah Fawcett hairstyle.In conclusion, this series is very mediocre at best. I remain astounded at the enthusiastic reviews for the series. I think this is simply due to the traditionally low standards of the core science fiction demographic. They have always been willing to sacrifice good writing for a basic sci-fi plot loaded with special effects. If that's your cup of tea, check out this series. If not, don't waste your time on this series.	2.0	Typically mediocre TV sci-fi for the undiscriminating viewer	2010-06-11	13	4	9

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A31N0XY2UTB25C	Stephanie Sullivan	Battlestar Galactica is a much better better version of the orignal 1970's fairly camp version with Loren Greene. It's darkly seductive reimagination of the Battlestar universe is compelling. One of the best things for me is how each season builds upon the arc of the previous seasons and in this version of Battlestar the reach earth in a way that makes sense.The mini-series laid the groundwork for the whole run and established the ground rules of the series. Season 1 provides an outstanding foundation on that groundwork to build the temple of Battlestar. Season 1 is where most of the main characters are built out and become fully realized - the basis upon which the many twists and revelations of the series long arc(s) depend upon for their impact.Kobal's last gleaming is the key that sets the foundation for all the upcoming seasons. To miss season 1 is to miss battlestar glactica.	5.0	If the mini-series was the groundwork season 1 is the foundation	2013-08-27	0	0	0
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1SB9ERHKAUTH3	Stephen	Simply the best thing on tv right now. I was a big fan of the original, though as enjoyable as it was, the re-imagining of it is much better. It isn't meant to be a remake. It is an entirely different take on it based upon the original storyline of the 12 colonies being destroyed by the Cylons. The characters are 3-dimensional, complicated, complex people with problems we can all relate to. Special Efx are super for tv and each episode pulls you in and makes you want to see what is going to happen next. The twist is even great---cylons that look like humans, which keeps you guessing each week who is, and who isn't. Even the mechanical ones are great if not creepy. As a former navyman, the comparisons of the battlestar to an aircraft carrier is uncanny. the look, jargon, everything is dead on.As for the 9/11 similarities, the basic premise of the show was created in the 70's, way before 9/11. Moore just made it a much darker, bleaker version of that. Personally, I look at the show for what it is and not what real tragedy it might mirror. Also, it really isn't that slow like people are saying. There are some slow episodes that focus more on the people, or one person, but they are generally sandwiched in between ones with action.For the reviewer who is asking about Season 2 on DVD, Season 2 doesn't even end airing here in the U.S. until Spring of 2006. Season 2 Episode 8 is on tonight, 9/9/05 and the season ends 9/23/05. The last 10 episodes of Season 2 will air in Janurary 2006, which means the DVD probably won't come out until summer 06. Season 3 I don't think has even begun filming.There are 2 versions of Season 1 here in the states--the Best buy one, and the one being released everywhere on 9/20. that one has alot more extra's then the BB version.Again, this is a wonderful show and just keeps getting better and better! Not anything like the original, and it is great that there is now the new one that concentrates on the drama, and the old one which is more sci-fi campy. Both are great on there own.	5.0	best darn show on television	2005-09-09	44	40	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3OH1NVEGM6J37	Stephen K	"Ok, to those whining about how the new (or ""good"") version of BSG makes significant changes to the 70's (or ""terrible"") version:Shut up and watch the show. I've seen the original, you are romanticizing how good it was. It was nothing more than a disco-infused (and terribly-written) attempt to cash in on the success of Star Wars. The characters were shallow, dialouge was ludicrous and special effects (including the clunky 70s toasters) were just plain awful.The comments of ""Cisco Kid"" below are typical of fans of the cheesy version of BSG. Let's look at Cisco's criticism, shall we?Cisco Kid said:""There was almost no continuity with the original. Turning Starbuck and Boomer in to Women!!!! What the Hell. If you wanted to use Female lead roles fine...but at least give them different names.""My response:IT'S A REMAKE! Why strive for continuity with something that sucked?  And so what if Starbuck is a woman? Why does that matter?Cisco Kid said:""The stories are nothing but lame drama very little action and almost no space action. The stores more resemble a soap opera than a sci fi show. It was like watching ""As Galactica Turns"".And once they had one of the actors fall in love with a cylon I quit watching.""My response:Uuhhh...you didn't watch the show.  The overwhelming critical acclaim and high ratings seem to indicate the opposite of your comment. The stories are tightly-plotted and superbly written. There is certainly a dramatic aspect to the new BSG, but it does not approach the super-melodrama of a soap...sorry, you're just wrong there. And, if you quit watching when Helo fell in love with Boomer, you didn't even finish watching the first episodes of season 1, so you are hardly qualified to make any comparison of the two shows. Also, season 2 of the ""good"" BSG (especially the first half) is fairly heavy in ""space action,"" again you clearly know nothing about the show you hate so much.Cisco Kid said:""The sets are lame, very low budget.The cyclons do not even look like some alien race no kind of armor, fine they did not have to make them look shiny...but making them look like humans ... Huh!""My response:Ok, you are either blind or stupid if you think the new BSG's sets are inferior to the crappy BSG's sets. Come on, it looks like the production company that brought us the first BSG series had to sneak onto the sets of ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" (equally cheesy, but still better than the original BSG) to shoot their series.  As for the new cylons, the humanoid cylons are a nod to the fact that man is the scariest monster humans will ever encounter.  As for the other (non-humanoid) cylons of the new BSG, the raiders are cool and the new centurions are pretty monstrous. Sorry they aren't as disco-ridiculous as the old BSG cylons...oh, wait...no, I'm not sorry, they were silly.Cisco Kid (and like-minded fans of the original BSG), give us all a break, OK?  If the original BSG was so good, why didn't it last more than 1 season? I know, there was Galactica 1980...I was trying to cut you a break by not even mentioning that disaster. The new BSG has lasted longer than the original and will go on for many more seasons. The original lasted ONE (low-rated and critically-panned) season.  The new BSG is going into season 3, is highly rated and loved by most critics. You do the math."	5.0	The Good (new BSG) and the Cheesy (old BSG)	2006-08-13	13	7	6

On Battlestar Galactica, he has assembled an incredible writing staff that includes writers from Deep Space 9, Carnivale, and the X-Files. It really shows. I've seldom seen a series where each episode is just a bit better than the last one with the first episode being really good. What you don't find here are stick figure characters.

Including both the mini series and the 1st Series, you don't have to be a Sci-Fi fan to enjoy the intense action and heartfelt storytelling which makes this a great product for anyone.The only downside to this product is the packaging in which it comes in.  Interesting to look at...at first, but struggling to understand who's idea it was to release a very expensive TV production on cheap cardboard fold-outs, with glued on polymer stalks to hold the discs in place...and when I say hold them in place, expect a struggle to get them off!Don't let the packaging put you off, This is a great show...And even greater in HD!!!	4.0	Great but not Perfect	2007-12-30	1	0	1

If you aren't a sci-fi fan, you should still consider checking this out. Even though it's in space and has killer robots, it is more human than most other drama shows on TV today. So say we all.This box set includes the miniseries that re-launched this show and returned it to TV for the first time since the 1970's. It has the 4-hour miniseries and the 13 episodes from the first season. It stars Edward James Olmos as Commander Adama Captain of the Battlestar Galactica, and Mary McDonnell as the newly invested president of the 12 colonies of man. She was formerly the secretary of education.The Cylon's had not been heard from in years. Then in one day they attack and destroy nearly all human life in attacks on all planets and most military assets. Now with the war against the Cylon robots lost, the Battlestar Galactica crew speed toward the fabled 13th colony on a long lost planet, called Earth.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1QVARU29455D0	Stuart W. Liming	"I understand that you ahven't seen the old cheesy Lorne Green version of Galatica in the 70's.  It's cool, I haven't either.However, for those looking for a sci-fi drama, this will fit your bill nicely.  Disc 1 is the 3-hour long miniseries, which both acted as a test for audiences of Sci-Fi if a series was a good idea, and as a pilot for said series.The cast of characters are pretty diverse, and the show rarely lets up on tension and drama.  Little details like the President's white board (which tallies the remaining human lives,) being kept up in time (meaning that if you see someone shot and killed, the whiteboard has gone down one.)As with any sci-fi series, there's a lot of theories and speculation thrown around about the direction and significance of the series, and it won't be long before you start in as well.This is a show of details, as I've noted before.  Instead of watching fighters fly in space like planes do (much like what you see in Star Wars,) they use small adjusting jets, and seem to ""flip"" and ""slide"" through space, which is closer to how our current ships work in space.  Things like this, and the almost constant sense of paranoia, will keep you in your seat and watching episode after episode.  A word of warning: you will be glad you have Season 2 on hand, given what Season 1's cliffhanger ending was like.  At the very least, order Season 2.0 from here in time to arrive before you finish disc 5.  You can thank me later."	4.0	One of the best shows on cable, and the best on Sci-Fi	2006-02-10	22	21	1
1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3QIU9MJJOMSW	Sunrise Kid	I watched the original Battlestar Galactica back in 1978 and loved it, and I love this reboot also, but for different reasons.  On the original I loved the camraderie between the characters and the often tongue-in-cheek dialog.  The new Galactica I love because it feels &#34;real&#34;, like real people in a crisis situation that just goes on and on, and trying to deal with it the best they can and often failing.  If I have any criticism, it's that the show could use a little bit more humor, even if it was gallows humor.  Most people resort to humor in tense situations just to lighten the mood and to keep from committing suicide.  But, I give the series a big thumbs up!	5.0	Well done reboot.	2014-03-15	0	0	0

Silly, melodramatic story lines with people bickering back and forth and story lines involving pointless & avoidable human problems & arguments, kinda like the brain-dead reality shows on MTV like Real World, etc. This show gets so much hype, I wonder how many people really like it, and how many have just heard how ""smart"" and wonderful it is from other people and TV talking heads. Maybe yet another example of Recieved Opinion?More observations:1) Typical modern, PC/feminist infected plot...to the point that the beloved main character has been transformed into a woman. I love strong female characters. The original show had them. Why don't we make a Star Wars series, and turn Princess Leia into a man, or Chewbacca into a frog?2) The creator admittedely had never even watched the original series. This is an abomination...maybe we should tap Michael Bay to produce the next romantic comedy.3) On a positive note, the look of the series is great. All the sets & equipment are ""aged"" ala Star Wars, giving them a realistic look.4) The noiseless energy beams from the fighters are scientifically correct, but this loses much of the dramatic effect. Watch the chase in the first scene of Star Wars: Episode IV with no sound, and you'll see what I mean.5) I'm not saying the original series was great. They used the battle scenes from the pilot for the rest of the series, and the acting & dialogue was second-rate at best. But at least it was FUN. The new one is too whiny and serious for sci-fi (for me...if you love it, more power to you).6) I hope the new Flash Gordon (August '07, Sci Fi Channel) isn't like this. The creators have already said they're ""re-amagining it"" like BSG. Oh, brother. Give me the campy, fun '80 movie version.Check out the Buck Rogers series (I think '79-'81) for good effects, cheesy fun and beautiful people. And the strong-female-heroine (basically Leia clone) Wilma (Erin Gray).PS - Spare me the following posts, oh yee hyper bloggers:""You're an idiot (or other insults)"" - it's just my opinion, people.""Check your facts before you post"" - makes you sound SO insecure.""You're just not smart enough to enjoy the depth of this show"" - Don't delude yourselves."	1.0	Melrose Space	2007-06-03	76	23	53

There are few shows that can match it in quality.The writing is top-notch; it is intelligent, insightful, and the development of the plot shows that the writers are NOT making things up as they go along which is a common flaw of serialized shows.The characters are like real people. They're flawed, complex individuals who fall in love; have friendships, fears and different values; and grow and change with new experiences.The acting is very strong, led by two Oscar nominated actors.The series is about humans who are being pursued by killer robots, and the plot is very gripping and provides many edge-of-your seat moments.There is a lot of emotion, suspense, and action.In short, this series will appeal to all people, not just sci-fi fans.	5.0	Excellent series for sci-fi fans and non-sci-fi fans alike	2005-08-31	39	35	4

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A1EXCLR2V2W20O	"Tarek Ali ""traveller"""	I ignored BattleStar Galactica [BG] for a long time, thinking that nothing could replace the depth and vision of Star Trek, believing that no other TV series could related to me as  well.  I was so wrong.Almost by accident I started watching and now I place BG up there with the magnificent  greats of Sci Fi.  I think the sadness and loneliness that BG inspires is what draws me the  most.  From the first frames of the pilot where nukes are dropped on lush colony planets  like golf balls spilled on the green, wiping out most of the human race, BG hit me in the  chest with the realization that this was going to be ecstasy and agony combined.BG appeals to the overriding theme that no matter how much man achieves, our self destructive nature always supersedes our perceived greatness, especially when the fall from grace is via our children, in this case the figurative cyborg race of Cylons.Watching the first season of BG, I am impressed by the exploration of complex themes such as what does it mean to be human, and what is perfection?  Also appreciated is the well timed, brisk and tight storylines of each episode, and the smooth grand arc that runs from season to season.The basis of BG appeals to some of our simplest instincts, the need to explore and conquer new frontiers, and to discover treasure such as lost home worlds, even though surrounded by seemingly invincible foes.The character development of BG is incredible - each member of the crew leaps out at you like normal humans thrust into raw situations, along with all their flaws that are cropping up all the time.Only now do I get to the actual Sci Fi aspect - simply put a good Sci Fi tale is more than lasers and propulsion.  Technology has to feel real - compared to the pristine sanitized decks of Federation Star Trek ships, somehow the grimy worn decks of BG seem more real, more authentic.I speak here only of season one, but I can safely say no matter where this journey goes I will follow, because this great magnificent odyssey or exodus of the last remaining flawed undefeated indefatigable humans appeals to me at a basic level.  The series richly deserves the honors heaped upon it.	5.0	Magnificent, sad odyssey	2007-12-30	6	5	1

But I watched a few episodes and quickly warmed to it. Edward James Elmos as Adama? It works. And Tricia Helfer helped me adapt as well... Turning the Cylons into the creations of the humans, albeit religious extremist beings who believe they have an edict from the ""one true God"", brings to mind great fiction like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bladerunner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and past and current political and religious conflicts like the ""war on terror"".

Anyone who is familiar with the original TV series of BSG knows humans didn't create the Cylons. A reptilian race known as the Cylons created the robots and chose to use a human form for their robots. That said I still enjoy watching anything BSG related.

However, you can't even compare this show to the original.As a life-long fan of all things ""Star Trek"" I can say that it is nice to find a show that can sucessfully carry the banner for Sci-Fi shows in this decade.  The writing is brilliant, suspensful, and intellegent.  This is definately a grown-up show, the audience is forced to think and to care.The acting is superb.  Edward James Olmos plays a captain the likes of which has never been seen before.  He has a command pressence that can peel paint off the walls, but at the same time he can be quiet and unassuming.  Mary McDonnell rules the screen as the soft-spoken President Roslin.  Katee Sachoff gives Starbuck a tough quality, but at the same time she is in no way over-masculine: she is all woman.The other characters are also expertly portrayed.  As I said above, the writers have done a great job in painting realistic and beleiveable characters on the screen coupled with an engaging storyline and well balanced visuals, Galactica has sucessfully managed to cross into the mainstream of TV.  You don't have to be a geek to understand or enjoy this show.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2L4XGVPR42KHL	"Therabbitssing ""on the rock that spews lava.."""	"For those of you old enough to remember, Battlestar Galactica was ABC's primetime answer to 'Star Wars' in 1978.  Boasting a booming orchestrated theme, a seasoned actor (the late Lorne Greene), and even fighters that managed to resemble X Wing fighters from Star Wars at a glance, the show opened to fantastic ratings. Though it may have been inspired from Star Wars, the story was all it's own, and incorporated many themes that you really didn't see on TV back in the 70's.  Unfortunately, also true of the 70's was the show's campiness.  It lasted one season, and then a second ""Sequel"" season (Galactica 1980) but that one was so horrid, even I remember it was cheesy and I was 7 years old at the time.Flash forward to 2003.  It's a different world we now live in.  Harsher, darker, edgier, and more dangerous.  And so began the re-imagined version of Battlestar Galactica, with a special 2 part mini series on the Sci-Fi channel.  Radically different in many respects, yet true to the show's original premise, it did well enough that Sci-Fi announced a full season of 13 episodes.  And these are the episodes that made TV worth watching again.  Picking up a few days after the end of the mini series, the show thrusts you into a roller coaster ride of tension and drama which ends in an amazing 2 part ending plus a cliffhanger that had people who saw it begging for more.This set will contain the entire first season plus the original mini series as well (a nice touch).  While Battlestar Galactica is a science fiction show (and airs on Sci-Fi primarily to boot), it more closely resembles a drama.  All the sci-fi techno babble is kept to a minimum.  There are no rubber headed monsters, no alien races that look like halloween costume rejects. This show is about the characters pure and simple.  The acting is top notch.  Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell spearhead the first rate cast as the Commander of the Galactica and the President of the 12 Colonies respectively. A special mention to Katee Sackhoff for her amazingly believable performance as Kara Thrace, call sign: ""Starbuck"".  She truly is an amazing character to watch on screen, complex and faulted.  In fact, that's what's so believable about the show...every one is human.  I don't mean homo sapien...I mean normal.  They make mistakes, they do stupid things, they mess up just like people do in real life.  No cardboard cut out heroes here, everyone is real.  They have faults (Col. Tigh the ship's XO has a drinking problem). Lee Adama (Apollo) has issues with his father.  Dr Gaius Baltar, genius but may be going complete whacko since he may or may not be talking to Six (Tricia Helfer), the sexy blonde humanoid Cylon in his head.  And then there's Boomer...oh man.Bottom line here....if you like drama, a little bit of action, amazingly detailed CGI, a first class cast with equally good scripts and dialogue, and a story that will leave you waiting for more, give this show a chance.  Many people who didn't even consider a science fiction show have become converts.  Firefly fans, take note too...CGI by Zoic, similar shooting style, and a story that focuses on the people, and not the spaceships make this a winner."	5.0	"Battlestar Galactica...""all growed up""!"	2005-07-24	39	30	9

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A217K5OANVKRV4	TJ Hara	"It makes me sad that there are still people trying to tear down this incredible series.  Most of these seem to be fans of the original, upset at how different it is from the show they grew up with, but these are the same diehards who received fair warning from no less than series lead Edward James Olmos: ""A person who really has a strict belief in the original, I would advise them not to watch this program.""  And is it really that different?You bet.  The last survivors of mankind fleeing their own extinction don't get an ""aw, shucks"" happy ending every week.  The two-dimensional (and he was not alone in that regard) villain of the 1978 series, while largely a slapstick pawn in 2004's Season One, is being developed into a deep, realistically-motivated villain in the currently-airing Season Two.  And what's at stake for our heroes is now highlighted in the new season's opening sequence by a running head count of the surviving humans.Is this new show an inappropriate allegory for Sept. 11, 2001?  Depending on the viewer, that may be a valid criticism; but the Sept. 11th-type catastrophe that kicks this series off is only a catalyst for the story to follow, and the series largely goes off in its own direction thereafter.  And while the attack itself has been visually and dramatically embellished to impart to the viewer a sense of its brutality, the end result is exactly the same as it was in the 1978 original.The new Battlestar Galactica is first and foremost a drama, and it takes the premise of the original and treats it with the gravity it deserved all along.  We're all that's left -- How do we go on from here?  This is superbly written, believably acted, and all-around well-executed television whose only stumbling block is a couple of cumbersome first season episodes dealing with law and politics after the end of the world.  For that flaw, I deduct a star, but nevertheless give this show my highest recommendation."	4.0	Just Amazing	2005-09-01	32	27	5

I Netflixed it, and soon I went through the first 2 seasons.  I was so excited about it, I bought the first season so I could get all my friends into it.

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3J0HXEAA6PZQL	"T. Malitis ""wolfgang-1"""	Lets face it this show had everything going against it.  1st it is on the SCi Fi channel.  2nd it was made after a cheezy tv show that failed after the 1st season (sorry to the hardcore fans!) 3rd it came at a time when Star Trek had reached it's saturation point.  But face it if it is a well writen and acted show they will come.  The best part with this season is you get the miniseries with it.  This is the part I like best, everything does not get all wrapped up at the end of every eppisode.  Unlike most tv shows the problem is presented then 10 minutes later there is a neatly comprised ending that makes us feel all warm and fuzzy.  By the way if you like that type of show, this may not be for you.  This show works much the opposite, just when you think it can not get any worse boom it does.  All I can stress is give the show a chance and you will be hooked.  Oh and for the visual people out there this show rivales most effects from any motion picture.	5.0	One of the greatest shows to come out of left field!	2007-12-27	3	2	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	ADHJ7GFXF2ROM	"Todd A. Nigro ""Tood"""	"I've noticed that this seems to be a polarizing series.  Most of the reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star.  The 5 star reviewers claim this is a perfect series, and the 1 star ppl think it's not even worth watching.  I honestly think it's somewhere in between.  I've finished with the first season set and I am looking forward to watching the second season.  I understand why sci-fi fans won't like this series.  There is a low action/battle to suspense/drama ratio.  I think most ppl were expecting a redo of the old series with new actors and better special effects.  I doubt the creators, simply wanted to televise a ""play"" of BG with new ppl.  I've noticed that more than a few opponents of the show say you will like BG if you enjoy the West Wing (I assume they have a very low opinion of that show as well), and will hate it if you enjoy Star Wars/Firefly/Star Trek.  Well, I am a big fan of all of those (including the West Wing), ranking Firefly at the top and then West Wing.  I think the show tries to cast big net and incorporate something for everyone:  Military vs. civilian, moral dilemmas, pseudo religious themes (which will really infuriate some ppl), space battles, suspense, personal demons, etc.  This series is by no means perfect.  The acting isn't always the best, and some characters over-act consistently.  Some of the difficult decisions various characters face are over-emphasized and brought up over and over and over...There isn't as much action as i would have hoped, and it's apparent they've tried to base their action sequences/camera work off the Firefly action scenes.  They've also changed Starbuck and Boomer to female characters to try and get that diversity that is inherit in Firefly's cast, but falls pretty short.  I recognize all this, and still I am genuinely interested in the Cylon/Human interaction, especially between Boomer and Helo/Boomer and other Cylons on Caprica.  It does seem unfair that this show could go on for so long, and Firefly gets cxld at the same time.  This show is comparable in style and genre, but Firefly is better in every way from character interaction to writing to camerawork.  ."	4.0	Love it or hate it	2008-07-11	3	3	0

It is edgy, tough minded, realistic, well written, well acted, etc, etc... The actors come off like they have been playing these characters for YEARS.  The themes are very strong and the story is so beautifully hopeless it makes you feel it.  I am a huge Babylon 5 fan, and the new Battlestar Galactica series is the only show that may have a real chance of unseating B5.  It is at once graceful and shot beautifully.  I am still reeling from season one's ending and I know the outcome.  Do yourself a huge favor if you love sci-fi...see this...buy this...It is a wonder!

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A2NMPDBX9HEJCS	Tommy M.	"If you're coming into this as a fan of the original, you will probably be confused and irritated. If you can accept Ronald Moore's vision, however, this show will bloom for you as it did for me. I was just a little too young to enjoy the original in its heyday, but I am fully versed in all of the Star Trek shows, and simply put -- even the weakest episodes of the new Battlestar put ST:TNG to shame, except perhaps for ""Measure of a Man."" The new BSG is not without its flaws, which I will discuss below, but those who rate it poorly must have sour grapes over how the new version has gone in some radically different directions. That's the only way I can account for their complaints.After watching season one of the new Battlestar on DVD, which had me glued to the TV over the course of two evenings, I am astounded at the quality of the dialog, characterizations, cinematography, special effects, and music. In retrospect, it saddens me that Paramount never budgeted this caliber production values and writing quality for its Star Trek shows. I can only wonder what those shows' producers could have done with more money. But I see the potential evident in BSG. This is what sci-fi TV could be, if taken seriously as Universal has: dignified, moving, dramatic, and thought-provoking.Of course, I promised to mention some flaws. I do not reduce my score because of these flaws, because of their *relative* unimportance, but it would be a disservice to the reader to claim that the new BSG is some kind of mind-blowing miracle. First of all, there is the decision to allow the Cyclons to look and act like humans. This creates all sorts of narrative problems. You end up with red herrings everywhere, most of which are probably unintended by the show's creators.Why? Because it stands to reason that not only can Cylons create androids that look human, but they could probably *replace* humans with Cylons. Any individual in the fleet, logically, could be Cylon --from one scene to the next. This creates unneccesary confusion that plants seeds of narrative doubt in the viewer's mind. It is certainly more intriguing than an army of ""toasters,"" but I believe it also carries a baggage of constant and slightly disorienting mystery.You can't become fully sympathetic with a character if he might have the rug of his identity pulled out from under him at any moment. Gaius could be a Cylon (which would go a long way towards explaning the beginning of the show). The president's assistant could be a Cylon. The XO could be a Cylon. And so forth. I don't think the writers intend for them to be -- but I can't be sure. So I can't become fully invested in their subplots without wondering, ""Maybe, just maybe...""Second, with all of these Cylon sleeper cells apparently working under cover -- why would none of them report back the location of the fleet? It doesn't stand to reason that they have only individual missions to carry out. They have little reason to chip away with occasional acts of terrorism. Just send a message back home and wait for the cavalry to arrive.I can only surmise that the Cylon mission is *not* to destroy humanity. I have my theories, but I'll leave it to the viewer to come up with theirs. Just as human-like Cylons introduce uneccesary confusion and tension, I wouldn't want to plant a seed of an idea if show's writers were in fact showing all their cards in regards to Cylon motivation.In short, I highly recommend this show to any sci-fi fan. In fact, I can confidently recommend it to fans of traditional, one-hour drama. It's that good. I understand that the second season is more action-oriented. But I think season one should stand proudly among shows like The West Wing, ER, Hill Street Blues, and 24. Because in truth, there are no weak episodes. There is no filler. I found almost every episode at least interesting, often funny and insightful, and sometimes positively magnetic."	5.0	Fantastic drama that effortlessly overcomes genre convention	2006-08-31	4	4	0

We can count on one finger the hours a week we get to spend escaping from our business, our jobs, and our family work.  We don't have a TV at our house (although we have 4 computers)  because we really don't have the patience to have ads pointed at us in our down time.

Think ER in its best years on steroids or the best episodes of Lost.I'm one of those people who gets only basic cable and I'd never seen a single episode until I purchased this DVD set.  I hate to admit it, but within a single day I'd watched six hours of the show - and it seemed like half that.There seem to be some people who really hate this show and I can't figure that out.  Some of them are upset that this is so different from the original 1970s series.  Nostalgia aside, if the new BSG was like the original it would be a campy farce, not a dark drama.There's always a danger of over hyping a show.  People watch a show or movie after hearing that it's the best thing since sliced bread and think, ""That was OK, but nothing to get that excited about.""  So don't fall for the hype.  If you love good television like Lost, if you like quality sci-fi, give BSG a serious look.  You'll be glad you did."	5.0	It will make you wonder why you watch bad network TV shows	2006-12-11	4	3	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AJS55ROVB592B	"Victor R. Maniglia ""Vito R. Mann"""	"I am a bonafied fan of the original Battlestar Galactica.  I cheered ABC television and Universal Studios when they decided to place BsG on at Sunday evening, a mere nine months later I also booed and hissed at them when they cancelled the show.  I was only twelve years old but I knew they had a certified hit worthy of a few seasons not a mere 12 episodes.  All of my friends agreed with me as we were drawing copies of a true Colonial Vyper.This ""ReImagined"" version is a far far wisper or is it a wimper as in wimpering canine, unlike a daggit which was a cute addition. This Remagined version doesn't even have lasers, it has ordinary guns.  THe gender changes don't play well with my sensibilities.  No I'm not a Male Chauvinist by any measure, but be serious Dirk Benedict was made for the role as a cigar chompping, womanizer. I doubt the woman playing his (Errrr) part could hardly stand when he was in that role.  The next problem Cylons weren't invented by mankind, they were a completely distinct race of creatures who were massacred by the cyborgs that replaced them.  Finally the role of Colonel Tigh is a joke for too many reasons to mention. Trust me Go ahead and pay the $80.00 for the original and see the diference for yourselves."	2.0	This is Not your Your Father's Battlestar Galactica	2005-10-09	48	20	28

The show is dramatic and emotional dealing with much more ""real"" feelings than most shows even attempt to do.  The show is powerful in its themes and presentation.  I can't say enough good things about this series.The DVDs have two low points for me however.  Some of the web based featurettes are missing, which you can see on the net it's nice to have in the set but maybe they'll make it into the second season DVD.  My biggest complaint is that the deleted scenes are not on the discs with their episodes but all on a single disc, the last.  I like to watch the deleted scenes after an episode to keep things in context but the way it's presented makes that much more work than I'd like it to be.

The Colonials are flawed, real people facing near extinction at the hands of their cast-off mechanical children, the Cylons, who have evolved into near perfect human replicas. The action scenes are top notch and some of the space battles are damn near epic. The continuing story arc is intelligent, ballsy, and at times down right spooky.If you've been avoiding watching it, for any reason, I'd seriously reconsider.	5.0	Frackin' good television!	2006-02-27	2	1	1

Remarks like that should be removed because they are offensive and wrong.Instead of attacking Americans one needs only to watch the series and listen to what Ron Moore has said. Ron Moore has stated that his vision of Battlestar deals with Septenber 11, the War on Terror, and al-Quaeda. That's a fact. It's obvious. Moore has stated that many times in interviews. There is no reason to attack America because you don't want to accept the obvious.	1.0	sci fi combined with real life terror	2005-09-06	84	23	61

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A4UKBG3M5U5TI	Westley	"I'm not really a fan of the sci-fi genre and had no interest in the original ""Battlestar Glacatica"" series, but so many people recommended ""BSG"" to me that I needed to check out at least a few episodes.  The series gets off to a pitch-perfect start with the mini-series and 13 episodes comprising Season 1.  The mini-series establishes the basic premise (cylons return and attack the 12 colonies; survivors flee) while also delivering bang-up entertainment.  I particularly like the twist of having the cylons able to take on human form, which is a nice cost-saver while also allowing for increased tension and paranoia, as the survivors ask themselves, ""Is my best friend a cylon?!?!""  But fear not, there's still plenty of old-style cylons (toasters) lurking around to keep things interesting for old-school robot lovers.The series also nicely balances the various elements so that it's not a ""cylon versus survivors fight of the week"" show, which would become boring very quickly.  We see glimpses into the budding romances on board the Galactica, the lives of the pilots as they defend the fleet, as well as the political landscape, with President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) struggling to maintain her power against the military, lead by Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos).  Indeed, one of my favorite episodes is ""Colonial Day,"" which is essentially their take-off of the political intrigue of ""The West Wing.""  I'm not a fan of either McDonnell or Olmos but they put in good performances, although I could do with fewer close-ups of Olmos (craggier than the moons of Kobol) spitting out his dialogue in a gravelly voice.""BSG"" aims for a more documentary-like feel than does the typical sci-fi show, which leads to a gritty, realistic tone that helps ground the series.  It's quite believable as a drama.  The only minor weakness is that the mini-series and first episode (""33"") are so incredibly strong and raise the bar so high that the rest of the first season simply cannot live up to those entries.  However, every episode is still compelling, high quality television.  The DVD set was put together with care and is crammed with audio commentaries of most episodes, behind-the-scenes peeks, and deleted scenes."	5.0	To flee or not to flee	2009-07-29	0	0	0

The great thing about the series is that it is real people in space with real dilemmas, with mixture of really cool sci-fi and an interesting mythology/religion. I find it fascinating that a group of people as sophisticated as they are worship the Greek gods, and the evil Cylons worship the one God for some strange reason-I think Ron D. Moore just wanted to switch them around from real life to see what it would be like. I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves dramas, sci-fi, or well anything except comedy(I think they should add some humor to the show like SG-1).

Davidson	"I'm going to echo most of the other reviews here and say that ""Battlestar Galactica"" is not just a great sci-fi show, it's a great drama, period. The writing, acting, cinematography, and special effects are as good or better than anything else on TV. Don't think that this show doesn't haven't anything to offer someone who doesn't get excited about space dogfights. The intriguing characters will keep you enthralled from episode to episode, and the sci-fi content, while integral to the show, never gets in the way of good storytelling, both on the political/military level and the human level.The one thing I especially wanted to comment on was ""Battlestar""'s reputation for being an unrelenting downer. Yes, the premise itself is pretty dark and the show is often harrowing, but that's not the whole story. This is definitely not ""Firefly."" But it's not all doom and gloom either. There are plenty of moments of triumph, joy, and even humor to keep the mood relatively balanced. So don't stay away from ""Battlestar"" because people make it sound so depressing!And make sure you purchase the Season 2.0 set in time to begin watching it right after you finish Season One.

But that is just not the case. I'm not going to address any of the fans of the original show who hate this new re-imagining with a vengeance. They can go sulk someplace else.The point is, Battlestar Galactica is a very well-written drama with sci-fi undertones. Very rarely will sci-fi be used as the main genre of an episode. Never is it purely technobabble and confusing plots and crazy names. Continuing what the 2003 miniseries began, the series is cutting loose from its sci-fi roots and is emerging as one of the better shows on TV. No cardboard cut-out characters. No cheesy lines or cheap props. Some may complain that the pacing is too slow, but that's just it. These people are used to the ""problem of the week"" sci-fi shows where something is addressed in one week and then the huge reset button in the sky is pressed and the characters are ready for next week. BSG is just not that. The characters have to face the consequences of their actions and their problems are not things that can be solved an a few minutes time. The characters do not magically heal, conflicts are not easily forgotten, and flaws are not solved simply through a nice pep talk.The characters in BSG are dynamic. They all have certain flaws which make their characters all the more enticing and interesting to follow. When you live within a ragtag fleet constantly running from the Cylons and with less than 50,000 other people, problems arise. Never before has political drama ever been done so well in a sci-fi series. The characters are human. They are not larger-than-life heroes who are stoic and ever-ready for battle. They are human.

I will only say this about the series--I thought the old Battlestar Galactica was pretty cheesy and, frankly, lame (I know die-hard fans will crucify me for that remark), but I fell in love with the re-imagined series when it came out.  It truly is much, much better than the original.The inclusion of the 2003 miniseries in its entirety is a great bonus (and the reason I gave this set five stars) since it provides the background on which the whole series is based.  The deleted scenes add some very useful contextual information to the series that will help viewers better understand several details, such as why the Viper pilots all touch a specific photograph when they file out of the ready room.  Other deleted scenes indicate the producers decided to cut out a minor character (and with good reason--he comes off as rather annoying).The digital transfer is excellent (at least to my non-pro eyes), and the show looks great on a large screen.  Overall, a definite buy for all Galactica fans.	5.0	Very good DVD of season 1 and the miniseries	2006-02-05	19	19	0

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"To be completely honest, I stumbled upon this show while searching for my next ""TV show DVD"" fix after finishing LOST, what I consider to be the greatest show in television history.  After typing in ""shows like LOST"" on multiple Google searches, this show was the one that kept popping up.  As I have always been a fan of science fiction (Star Trek, primarily), I decide to give it a chance.  I may not (yet) have found ""LOST redux"", but Battlestar Galactica is a solid show in its own right.For a basic plot summary, BSG Season 1 sets the groundwork for the entire series.  The Cylons, a ""race"" of mechanical beings created by humans, return after years away to destroy the human planet Caprica and ultimately take over the galaxy.  The only survivors are a small fleet of space vessels led by the warship Galactica.  Escaping into the far reaches of the galaxy, the fleet must simultaneously keep one step ahead of the Cylons, set up a government structure, and deal with the fact that the Cylons look, feel, think, and sometimes may not even realize that they are not, indeed, human.  Ultimately, the fleet is heading towards planet Earth, a mythical place that may or may not exist.What makes this show so interesting is that it is much grittier than most science fiction TV fare, containing none of the flash of Star Trek or the pompousness of Star Wars.  Simply put, this is a human drama played out on spaceships instead of back yards.  Space may be the backdrop, but all the events and characters are quite relatable and very human.The acting is also top notch, especially the parts of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), Captain Adama (Jamie Bamber), and Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff).  By the end of the first season, you will truly care about what happens to each of those figures, the mark of great acting performances.In terms of comparing this BSG to its earlier counterpart, I cannot because I haven't seen a minute of the original version.  However, suffice it to say that the 1970s version is not requisite viewing before this version.  The new one here stands very much on its own.About the only reasons I can't give this show a full five stars (4.5 would be a more accurate rating) are because the drama (at times) was actually a bit too sparse (the middle of the season dragged a bit), and some plotlines were severely underdeveloped.  Perhaps those issues will be resolved in coming seasons, and I'm probably even nitpicking a bit.Thus, overall, while it may not quite measure up to season one of LOST, it is a fine creation with strong writing, good plots, high drama, and evolving characters.  I see tremendous potential for BSG to vault even higher in its sophomore attempt."	4.0	Looking For LOST; Found Something Close Here...	2011-06-25	1	0	1

1417054069	Battlestar Galactica: Season One	A3HYHAXDGHKV70	Z. Fowler	"Battlestar Galactica is a well-constructed but somewhat flawed series. The plot is compelling, the special effects are excellent by TV standards, and some of the characters are very creative. But it is not the characters themselves so much as the complex relationships and roles between them that serve as the highlight of the show. In that respect I'd say that a comparison between BSG and Lost seems pretty apt. Both shows feature a number of major characters with substantial backstories, and the protagonists live day to day as refugees under persecution from a mysterious and malevolent enemy. The issue of trust (or the lack thereof) is also a major theme in both series. This unease and inability to completely trust anyone adds a lot of interesting dynamics to both shows and helps keep things engaging.In comparison to the cast of Lost, the individual characters of BSG lack subtlety and a bit of charm. They aren't the awful cardboard cutout characters you'll find on your average TV series, but several of them fail to escape the feeling that they are characters portrayed by actors rather than real people. Grace Park is weak as Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii and never quite manages to make us feel torn over sympathies to her character, which is unfortunate due to the great potential of the character. Dr. Baltar, played by James Callis, is charming but ultimately over-acted to the point where his eccentricity begins to annoy. The simple sleaziness of his companion, played by Tricia Helfer, becomes predictable and boring after enough encounters. There are moments that hint at a hidden complexity to her character, but they are not enough to overcome the sense of straightforward exploitation that ultimately ends up being repellent.There are some standouts, however. Mary McDonnell does a great job of balancing the weariness of President Roslin's character with a girlish lightness and stubborn confidence. Her occasional conflicts with Admiral Adama, played by Edward James Olmos, are one of the best parts of the show. The handling of these two characters in particular is very mature and intelligent, acting as something of a philosophical discussion over the balance of political and military powers during times of duress. The writers manage to smartly comment on such philosophical issues without coming across as preachy or full of themselves. Michael Hogan as Colonel Tigh is another highlight of the show, a bitter and grumpy senior officer who serves as Adama's second in command. Although Tigh as a character is not overly complex or fascinating, Hogan's performances truly bring the character to life. Even his somewhat forced antagonism of maverick pilot Starbuck ends up being enjoyable to watch.BSG sometimes suffers from feeling a little too transparently engineered, not only in terms of characters but also in terms of the occasional plot point and bits of dialogue. As one example, the characters say ""frack"" as a substitute for a four-letter word not permissible on television, and the feeling of silliness at hearing the word unfortunately doesn't go away. The reason that's so problematic is because people usually cuss the most during their most dramatic moments, and the usage of this silly nonsense word really weakens the impact of such scenes. The word stands out so prominently because there is a noticeable lack of other such fictional slang, making it feel that much more out of place.Sensuality is handled awkwardly in BSG as well. One of the characters serves as little more than sex appeal, to the point that her sensuality becomes an unappealing caricature. One gets the impression that the only reason they didn't have full nudity and fully explicit sex scenes is because of network censors. There is no nuance to her sensuality or affection -- it's simply sexy time 24/7, and the shameless exploitation quickly grows tiresome. Don't misunderstand me, as I'm no prude about sex on TV. I loved most of Scrubs, including its raunchiness. But with Scrubs the sex appeal was about the characters, not the other way around. There are sexual encounters between other characters as well, but the expected tension and buildup to them is missing. We never really see any sparks fly or witness a real sense of connection between the characters, so the scenes end up feeling clumsy and forced.The soundtrack is hit and miss. There are some creative choices that are pulled off quite well, such as the tribal drums beats scoring the combat sequences and a few moments where soft music contrasts with an intense scene. But at other times the strange choices in music misfired and left me chuckling, such as a tender father-and-son moment being inexplicably accompanied by bagpipes. Did the Adamas suddenly feel the luck of the Irish?Overall I'd say it's a good show worth watching. The flaws I picked up on may not bother some people whatsoever, or may not even be considered flaws to those with different tastes; I only emphasize them as a kind of counterpoint to the boundless enthusiasm you will find in many other reviews. Not everyone will love BSG, but its failings certainly do not outweigh its successes. I'm certainly picking up the second season, myself.I've been intentionally vague in this review so as not to reveal certain plot surprises to those deciding whether to jump in.
