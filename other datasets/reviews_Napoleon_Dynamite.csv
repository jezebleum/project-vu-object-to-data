While some people who like wasting their precious time may enjoy it, there's a name for those people, we call them idiots.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2LNR55TM67AU4	&#34;Gimpy&#34; Peach Johnson	"For nearly a year, I've had to endure siblings and friends quoting this movie and breaking into uncontrollable fits of laughter, so I finally decided I had to see it too so that I might laugh along. From the opening scene, things looked mildly promising. Napolean, the nerdiest, sleepiest-looking high-schooler you've ever seen hops on a school bus where another kid asks, ""Napolean, what are you going to do today?"" Napolean replies ""Whatever I feel like -- GOSH!"" with a little jerk of his head. Then he pulls a plastic figurine from his pocket, ties a string around its neck, and lowers it out of the window, letting it drag along the ground behind the bus. All right, I thought, this is going to be one of those screwy comedies full of eccentric characters who do random things. I was prepared for that, but I wasn't prepared for the 90-minute borefest that ensued. With no real plot to speak of, and characters that just aren't that likeable or interesting, I found myself longing for the movie to be over only a few minutes into it. I stuck it through in the hopes that it would improve, but no such luck. As far as comedes go, the humor in this one is quite subtle, and consistent in style throughout. If you like the first ten minutes, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the movie. If after ten minutes you find it isn't your cup of tea, stop there--it doesn't get any better.I was tempted to give only one star, but I felt like being a little generous, perhaps because after suffering through this movie, I finally can understand references to it (those ""Vote for Pedro"" bumper stickers and tee-shirts, my family's quotes, and Heder's recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was quite funny after seeing this film). Apparently, this is a film you either love or hate. I can't stand it. If you have not yet seen this move, I'd recommend borrowing it or renting it before buying."	2.0	Just not that funny -- GOSH!	2005-12-03	17	10	7
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2NBS3T65WHSH9	"77vqmous ""-e-"""	A lot of people wonder which era this movie takes place in. The clothes, the music, the technology. Fact is, this movie captures perfectly the atmosphere of small town U.S.A. in any decade. For that, it's timeless.Napoleon will remind you of at least one of your K-12 chums (where are they now?). He's no hero, but it is fun to watch him blunder through a bad couple of days. Surrounded by familiar characters that almost need no introduction (Uncle Rico, a study in casting/character acting perfection), he sets off on an explosive, action packed effects extraviganza.Well, maybe not, but the fact that you can almost smell the tater tots and soiled elasto/parachute/hammer pants makes this a trip down memory lane. Any more, I enjoy getting thrown a curve ball when I go see a movie. Napoleon Dynamite satisfied that, and should be considered among the great works of restrained, simplistic, comedic genius.Don't forget to stick around after the credits for the second happy ending.	5.0	oh moon boots, where art thou?	2004-12-24	6	5	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1H9BKI1AE594Q	7th Angl	Simply put, Napoleon Dynamite is a very odd movie.  A conventional plot involving a student election and a prom sub-plot, never really materialize in a decent climax (albeit, the wedding scene could be construed as such, though it does not even appear until after the movie credits).  But this misgiving in some measure is balanced by the bizarre performances, for Napoleon and his cronies are quite remarkable and memorable.  Napoleon is a character who appears to be in a perpetual state of angst and/or oblivion, and is very hilarious in his own right (not to mention the stoned expression on his face which he wears throughout the whole movie). At times Napoleon Dynamite feels like it was made in the late seventies or early eighties, there is a definite retro quality to it that is difficult to articulate.  One should take heed, however, if one is bored by the film after half an hour of viewing it.  The pace remains very slow, and character development is basically established and finalized within the first quarter or so.  But the comedic elements are very curious and subtle, and, at times, unrelenting which makes for Napoleon Dynamite's unique stature as a film that effectively synthesizes drama and irony.	4.0	Compelling Performance by Jared Hess	2004-12-27	1	1	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AR9QPZFX65LDV	Aaron Alexander	Napoleon Dynamite doesn't have too much of a plot to start with; A high-school geek and his friend try to find a girl who will want to go to the school dance with them sums it up in a nutshell. There are still lots of laughs to be had throught the movie anyway. The fact that no matter what the situation, the same wierd expression on Napoleon's face never changes got a lot of laughs out of me. I watched it with a group of people of many ages and they all found something they liked in this movie. The younger kids thought things like Napoleon's uncle takeing a self-defense class and the old farmer shooting his cow (with a school bus driving past and covering the scene) were funny, and everyone was laughing when Napoleon started danceing for his friend Pedro's class presidential election skit. There are many great things for the casual viewer to enjoy, but don't come anywhere near this movie if your looking for something with a Lord of the Rings plot depth. I don't think I would pay to see it again, but I wouldn't necessarily avoid it.	3.0	Funny, but not very deep	2006-01-02	4	1	3

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A35HP4PZ6A6Y3S	A. Banford	In my opinion, this movie is WAAAAY overrated.  I rented it after hearing raving reviews of this movie, but I was only dissapointed.  Granted, I carried fairly high expectations from the geeky fawners of this movie.I heard this movie was about a boy struggling to be himself in a world full of the same.  When I watched, I found no evidence of the boy struggling at all.  Even if this wasn't the true plot of the story, the movie followed little plot at all.  There were a few funny parts in the movie, but none were wonderful enough to make me laugh out loud...and I laugh a lot!Halfway through the movie, I became bored.  There was no substance to hang on to and the main character was too awkward and lost in his own world to even follow.  I couldn't figure out what he was thinking!  Did he like the make-up selling girl or did he not care about her at all?  I had a hard time finishing this movie and that hasn't happened since I saw Beethoven in the theatres.If you are contemplating seeing this movie, I suggest you see Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  It is a similar movie, but it has a bit more substance and better humour.	3.0	Funny, but not that funny.	2005-06-07	4	1	3

John Heder as the everyman geek is great.  It is refreshing to see a kid who gets pushed around, but is not afraid to stick up for himself.  That is what makes this ""teenage"" genre movie exceptional.  The actors make Idaho seem as if it is some kind of alternate universe, other dimensional.  But, it all works.  Great little movie.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	APWOZN7FHC5QX	A. Challancin	"This movie is a refreshing alternative to the standard format of over the top gross-out humor and language that has become standard in teen/20 something comedies.While movies like American Pie have their good points, the same old jokes and derivitive plots are getting tired.  In contrast, Napoleon Dynamite's sureal deadpan feels like a breath of fresh air.Although devoid of gross-out humor, everything about this movie was designed deliberately to make the viewer cringe.  Every character is their own brand of loser...not one is without glaring outward faults.  Every character is immersed in their own brand of misery, ridiculousness, and/or sense of dilusion.Right smack in the middle of this hellish reality you have Napoleon, who at first glance seems the biggest loser of the lot.  However, by the end of the movie it becomes clear that it's not the case.Rather than attempt to fit into what is at best a painful reality, Napoleon simply chooses to reject most of it and substitute his own.  In doing so, he creates an island within himself and a means to filter the world around him.  His blank expression reflects this well.In contrast to the apathy that he shows towards most of the world, Napoleon proves himself a good friend to to those he cares about, and capable of hate towards those whose adverse actions penetrate his ability to ignore them, or harm the ones he cares about.In the final scene, his impromtu ""skit"" in front of the school illuminates his character clearly.  Rather than see his friend let down, he intervenes without thought to himself.In a film with a diverse cast of losers, the ones that ultimately end up with a measure of happiness and redemption have two things in common:1) They recognise the core quality in the people they care about regardless of how others might percieve them.2) The are able to live in a bubble of their own reality and shut out the rest.While a humor of film like this might be missed by some of its audience, it leaves the rest laughing out loud."	4.0	Unique and Entertaining	2005-01-14	4	3	1

People will laugh at anything today only because other people laugh at it and they laugh  at it because you laugh at it.  The damn movie had no purpose at all and the thing that gets me angry is that people who have no interest in independent movies talk about it like they always knew about it.I remember seeing a preview of it on IFC last year thinking it would go nowhere, but, some twisted genius at a film festival saw how terrible it was and knew it would be a hit amongst idiot teens.I'm 19 and I hate it, no matter where I go if I here someone talk about it I speak my mind, I can't let people go through life thinking this movie is good.  Think about, if Ms.Swan from Mad tv had a movie 80-something minutes long would you wanna sit through it?  HELL NAW! That's how this movie should be viewed as a sketch comedy character.  Pat from SNL had a movie that went nowhere, Wayne's World wasn't (...), Coneheads was cool but still think about.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A6NJ1GAUXC1JW	A Customer	"This movie is not only humorous, but its down-right flippin' brilliant.  I've watched Napoleon Dynamite numerous times and what impresses me more and more with each viewing is how ""perfect"" a movie it is.  Editing, filming, screenwriting - the whole ""deelio,"" as Uncle Rico would say.Hess displays an incredible economy with scenes and dialogue.  I'd be a bigger fan of ""Indie"" films (as much as I hate to use that stupid term), if more of them displayed the self-deprecating modesty and humility of Napoleon Dynamite, instead of their usual self-important preachiness. (Can you say, Vincent Gallo?)In fact, I think that's a big part of the attraction of ND to people - the cast of goofy characters are more ""real"" and complex - the message, more universal, subtle, and poignant - than artsy fartsy films that try to be so deep and serious.  (Can you say, Vincent Gallo?)Many of today's cutting edge film-makers think they impress us by pushing the envelope in their use of language, violence, and sex.  How about just impressing me with a GOOD MOVIE!Keep an eye on Hess - he is a real talent.

"Chapped Stick, Chapped Lips, and things like Tetherball.As an independant film maker, I walk into any such film with an open mind, and wish them the best of luck. This time, it was all I could do to contain myself. Now everyone I know has heard about Napoleon Dynamite.There are many incredible things about the picture. First, its a simple story without any extravagances. No melodramatic overtones, nor the cardboard cut-out characteristics, just a laid back comedy. Can I get a ""Sweet?""

There would have been some serious questions. I have read through many critics likes and dislikes. (Cause apparently this is an ""everone loves it or hates it"" kind of movie.) Mainly those that dislike it want ""form."" Dynamite needs no form. You jump into his mixed-up life for a couple of days, then jump back out again.I guarantee those that love silly humor will be quoting lines for weeks.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3OGWBZV2F8M74	"Adam Rosenbaum ""Author of 'How to Remember No..."	"Napoleon Dynamite is a unique, quirky, and funny study of characters in a small rural town in Idaho. There's the main character Napolean who exists in the strange world of a geeky misfit, his aimless older brother who spends all day in internet chat rooms, and his Uncle Rico who who basically lives in a van down by the river and wishes he could go back and replay his high school football games. And of course there's Napolean's best friend Pedro whose expectations are unrealistic sometimes.This movie does not conform to any Hollywood template, and some people will see the humor in it while other won't, in the same way some think Woody Allen is hilarious and others can't stand him. The plot, which is really just a week (or so) in the life of Napolean Dynamite, isn't the point as much as the characters and their relationships and conflicts with each other.If you get a kick out of movies like ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""Raising Arizona,"" ""Best in Show,"" or ""Waiting for Guffman,"" this movie is probably a good choice for you."	5.0	Unique, quirky, and funny	2005-07-23	8	5	3

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G	"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF"""	"Napoleon Dynamite is a loser who goes to high school and is treated fairly well considering how much of a loser he is.  He wears t-shirts tucked into perfectly-fit jeans, the bottoms of which are tucked into snowboots, which is interesting considering not a flake of snow falls in the entire film, although he is from Idaho, where perhaps snow is something that if it's not falling outside, it's falling in your mind.  His one friend is Pedro, the only Latin-American student in a school filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed wunderkinds.Actually the people who makeup the school, and the surrounding town, are quite fascinating.  They're not gorgeous, or classically beautiful, but grotesque.  That is; they could be beautiful, or at least considered attractive, but there's an element of ugliness to them, some sort of black smudge on the colorful canvas.  Napoleon is emblematic of this in that he is grotesque himself; his hair is curly and uncontrollable, his clothes are almost purposefully unattractive, his slouch and his half-closed eyes make him look as unalert as a rock.  So is everyone around him; unalert to the qualities that make them grotesque (although that is essentially what being grotesque is; you have to not know you are).Enough about grotesqueries!  Pedro decides to run for class president to bring balance to the darkness that is the other candidate, the plucky Summer.  She is the ""most popular girl"" in school, and is surely a lock to win.  The futility of Pedro's chances of winning lend a pity to his character that we might feel for Napoleon if he wasn't so blatantly unconcerned with his own popularity.  Pedro has no idea what to say in his pre-election speech; but Napoleon says, either out of exasperation or genuine concern, ""Tell them if they vote for you then all their wildest dreams will come true.""  Hmm.  Sounds like a throwaway line at first, but Pedro delivers it at the end of a speech that is sure to lose him the election.  It makes you wonder why he really cares about winning the election, especially since he seemed to understand how futile it all was.  To make things even more hopeless, after his speech, he must deliver a skit.  A skit?  Pedro has no clue, and he's even less animated than Napoleon.Then comes one of the most touching scenes I have ever seen.  Napoleon gives a dance-mix tape to the guy running the PA, goes on stage, and dances to ""Canned Heat.""  Then you realize that underneath that facade of unawareness and passivity is a genuine friend.  He basically lays his life on the line if you think about it; for how would the entire school treat him afterwards if they took it the wrong way?  He could barely set foot in that High School if it failed, his life would be made miserable day after day.  But it works!  They roar with applause; and Pedro becomes class president.Amazingly all ends meet, in a movie without a punchline.  What happens to Napoleon now though?  I assume he keeps going down his own path, where he'll stumble into greatness, whether he knows it or not."	5.0	Can be funny and touching...	2005-02-07	10	8	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"This film has been at our local independent theater for about six months now.  I could be exaggerating, but I do not know the exact time.  All I do know is that it has been there for a very long extended period of time.  I have heard from several kids (children between the ages of 10 and 15) that this was a very funny movie and it seemed like the parents were in agreement.  Normally, this would turn me off a film, but since it was a ""independent"" film, I thought that perhaps we had stumbled onto a goldmine and I was the last to reap the benefits.  So, without delay, I gathered up some friends and sat (with cackling girls behind us) as nearly two hours of my life was drained from my soul.  Between the inconsistent story, the jumbled themes, the off-beat pacing, the teenage girls laughing before the joke happened, and the ""must-seem-independent"" feel Napoleon Dynamite just didn't work.I know, I know, let the gasping of air commence.  I have trouble seeing what everyone has loved about this film.  To begin with, why were we laughing at this character?  I remember the audience similarly laughing hysterically at Sandler's character in Punch-Drunk Love.  Is this character made to be laughed at?  Didn't anyone in the audience feel sorry for this underprivileged teenager?  While others were laughing hysterically at the overused and uncreative words that vomited from Napoleon's mouth, I was feeling sad for this guy.  He was constantly getting pushed around in school, he had a disorder of some kind that nobody seemed concerned about, and at first he had no friends.  He was a product of a dysfunctional family that we found funny.  It wasn't funny.  This film wasn't funny.  This film was sad, with some elements of humor mixed in to cover up the inhumanity.Perhaps I am being too harsh on this film.  Perhaps I should just take it as a light comedy that speaks to the insecure teenager in all of us.  Sadly, I cannot.  Even if you look past the characters, which all seemed forced by the actors playing them, the cinematography and story was not very strong.  Napoleon did things that made no sense to me.  At first I thought he was a very intelligent person, just misunderstood in school, but later I discovered that he was just an idiot.  Education came last behind tetherball, girls, tots, and Pedro.  I never once understood the time frame of this film.  Were we watching a film set today, but seemingly still lost in the 80s or were we watching an 80s film?  Was the director paying homage to the 80s, or simply making fun of them?  These were key issues that needed to be explained that never were developed.  The music and costume pointed to the 80s, yet the music and calendars pointed to 2004.  There needed to be a set time for this film and it needed to be released so that we, the audience, were not confused by this idea.  Even the dancing seemed dated.Next, while we were outside watching Napoleon create more insecurity for those unlike others, his family also co-existed with him.  This meant that while we were watching Napoleon at school, his family was continuing with life whether we knew what was going on or not.  This was a major downfall to this film.  I wanted to see more of a story with Kip and LaFawnduh.  I wanted to know more about Uncle Rico and the life that he led. I can honestly say that Uncle Rico's character was the least developed character that I have encountered in film in a long time.  I wanted to know more about Deb.  There was so much exploring that could have happened with this film that I felt cheated when the film was finally over.  Napoleon's world was huge, and maybe if we did more than just scratch the surface of his life I would have enjoyed this film much more.Overall, this was a very poor film.  I could not relate or get involved with the characters in any way.  I felt the director was trying too hard to make the film seem independent with amateur shots and oddball antics.  Near the middle of this film I began seeing images that other directors have used especially like Wes Anderson (see Bottle Rocket) and Sophia Coppola (see Virgin Suicides).  But instead of actual creativity and some smart and witty writing, this film just fell short by substituting lines like ""sweet"" and ""GOSH"".  This was a sad excuse for character development.  I felt like I was watching a high school project that felt (and was) plagiarized and uncreative.  This was not the film that everyone spoke of, this was a petty excuse for a film by cheating us into thinking it could be more by having low budgets and a seriously challenged main character.  This is not a comedy.  While I did grin a brief moment during the FFA testing, the rest of the time I was counting the minutes until it was over.  I do not recommend this film to children unless you are suggesting that they laugh at those that are less fortunate.

And then far worse, you can think anybody who actually says this is crap-de-la-crap is a real jerk.This is a movie about people who are so pathetically nerdy that they are clearly caricatures created by those who seem them as such - yet the caricatures will win over the jocks at the end of the movie - thereby attracting a certain type of nerdy retard wannabe to think it's cool; and that's the jocks turned MTV screenwriter plan, because only somebody as truly pathetic as these characters in this story could like it.It's really a simple test they've created ...did you like it?Aren't you cool?Sorry, I'm not so hip.

I was serving as a missionary for my church, at which time I didn't watch any TV or movies or even listen to much music. I heard a little bit about Napoleon Dynamite, and alot of people were quoting it(""IDIOTS""). All I saw was a formula for disaster. Everyone said there was no plot and that there were alot of inside jokes. All of the 10-15 yr old crowd seemed highly entertained while most of their parents did not. So when I got home (which was after the lunacy), I hesitated, even rejected invitations to watch it. Then one day, at Blockbuster, my dad convinced me to watch it. Honestly, I loved it.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A19HQVND02SRWE	Alan	"A co-worker of mine was a big fan of this film when it came out, and has never stopped talking about it.  When I finally saw the film, I wasn't disappointed.  The plot, in a nutshell, is...well, there really *isn't* much of a plot.  The film follows a few days in the life of Napoleon Dynamite, uber-geek.  He lives with his grandmother and brother, Kip.  When Grandma gets hurt, Uncle Rico moves in to take care of them (even though Kip is 30!).  Meanwhile, Napoleon befriends the new kid at school, Pedro, who is also a misfit.I've only seen the film once so far, but I'm sure it will be even funnier the second time because the first viewing is spent ""taking it all in"".  It's very odd, and very funny, and I lost count of all the great quotable lines in the film.  Another thing worth mentioning is that they could show this film on network television without editing anything -- there is no foul language or content that would be inappropriate for young viewers.  I'm not one of those ""holier than thou"" types (who, quite honestly, I loathe, because they tend to be hypocrites), but as someone with a family, I can appreciate a film we can all watch together.So check it out -- and stick around after the credits to see Kip singing to Lafawnduh!"	4.0	Original, funny, and more than a little strange	2005-06-16	1	1	0

It deterred me even more when I saw the ""MTV Films"" logo jump into the screen at the beginning. But to my surprise, Napoleon Dynamite turned out to be a smart, and uniquely funny independent film.You can't help but feel pity for most of the characters in this film. Uncle Rico's delusional dreams of being an all-star quarterback circa 1982. Pedro, the quiet pinata smashing Mexican, or poor Deb, who's just trying to raise money for college. Kip (Napoleon's Brother) is one of the stranger characters in the film, who seems to be gay, but is in love with LaFawnduh, a voluptuous black woman he met over the internet. For whatever reason, these characters are very appealing to the average movie watcher.Although the movie has little to no plot, it doesn't pale in originality. So many of the jokes are different, dry and satirical, that some of them slip through the cracks. This film is great for repeat watching, just because it is so unique, and so many of the jokes are like ""What!?""; it just makes you want to see them again. I would say that young geeks like myself would like this movie the most, but it seems that geeks of all ages relate to the movie equally. I would go as far as to say that non-geeks would look down on, or feel pity for the characters enough to chuckle at.

I got a kick out of Napoleon's treasure hunt in the thrift shop, and seeing the 80s and early 90s fashions that I so awkwardly wore to please my mother, long after they went out of fashion. Tetherball, Tater Tots, mixed tapes, and sibling rivalry rounded out the warm and fuzzy feeling.Note that this is not a movie for watching alone, but with friends who also grew up in the 80s and early 90s.	5.0	Aaaahhh... nostalgia!	2005-09-28	0	0	0

He is the total white guy down to the knee socks with deck shoes.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A17A6MCQW84UIW	"Amazon Customer ""archimedesz"""	Someone could do a research paper on just the reviews of this movie!This is a wonderful movie to watch with friends.  It is funny, and despite the moments (long, long moments) when nothing seems to happen, the timing is impeccable.  If you don't *really* have a funny bone in your body, don't watch this.  (If all you get is put-down humor, stay away.  Seriously.)Plot Summary.  Napoleon Dynamite is an awkward young man; a skateboard dude who hasn't actually discovered a skateboard.  He is continually bullied by the cool kids in his school, but manages to keep up a level of defiance (a little whiny, though), and somehow you sense that this fellow is not one who needs the endorsement of his peers.  Still, he continues to reach out to an amazing degree; a dude who does not accept that he has been branded a loser.In his awkward fashion, he befriends a Latino kid, and a slightly eccentric girl.  Despite the cartoon-like style of these two characters, they manage to be quite 3-dimensional in their own way.  Other important people are Napoleon's brother (Kyle?); his uncle, an aging football player wannabe; Tina, a Llama (totally cute), and (last but not least) LaFawndah, a girl Kyle meets on the internet.  There's also Summer what'sername's mother, an indealistic midwestern woman who encourages her daughter to accept Napoleon's invitation to a school dance.As you will see, none of the 'stereotypes' in the movie are what one expects them to be, exactly.  And when Deb (the girl who turns up on Napoleon's doorstep, selling discount photo portraits) realizes, to her alarm, that a customer is hitting on her, she responds with the kind of grave reproach that is an example to us all!  Oh Deb, what a girl!  And Pedro (who runs for President of the class) has more than meets the eye --perhaps not much more, but still more.  The obnoxious popular kids --cheerleaders and football players, etc-- are not as obnoxious as they could be.  I can honestly say that this movie shows obnoxious wannabees how to be moderately obnoxious.  Moderation in all things is a worthy goal.Yes, all the characters are cartoons.  The movie is sort of a parable, and parables do deal with cartoons.  Still, they're cartoons with a lot of depth.  A lot.Arch	4.0	Phenomenal.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1VHK9A4VLJTHC	"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly"""	My son doesn't write, much less write reviews, nor does he read.  He bragged the other day that he's only read one book in his entire life.  Of course, he thinks I'm a total freak because I constantly read and obviously, I write reviews here at Amazon.This film is, you've probably already guessed it, one of my son's all time favorite films.  He could be a salesman for it, he's sent dozens to rent it or see it at the show.  He bought the sound track.  He's seen it a dozen times already, and when he got me to sit and watch it today with him, he was constantly saying the punch lines right before they happened.  The turd.Anyway, so I thought it was about the most stupid and pointless flick ever, thus the three star review.  He thinks it's a five, I think a one, one plus five divided by two equals three.  Easy.So anyway, should you watch this?  Well, if you're actually reading this far into this review, let me guess, you'll probably think the movie is as dumb as I did, however, if you need a cool gift for a 18 something teenage boy, this is definately it, assuming the kid wasn't/isn't in fact, one of the nerdy type.  Probably my problem.Maybe I'm too cynical, perhaps the movie is such genius that it really is brillant after all.  Perhaps you'll have to find out for yourself, I mean, even Pulp Fiction was hated by some and loved by others.I'll say this; the last major scene of the film, a dance number done by the nerd in front of the school, that was well done.  You have to be really good to dance well in a bad way, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, good luck figuring out if this movie is worth seeing.	3.0	This an average rating between my and son	2005-01-02	9	1	8

Most of us honestly relate to these characters recognizing in them some degree of the awkwardness that is common to all of us.When the characters achieve a pitifully tiny victory we are left to recognize how painfully rare even small victories can be.

It seems like whenever I see a film about kids in school, they are either criminals or repelling aliens from space.  In this film, all the kids are just ordinary -- ordinary dorks, ordinary jocks, ordinary mean, ordinary decent.  No one is really awful, and everyone is basically OK.  But Napoleon, his brother kip, and uncle Rico have to be the best drawn dorks I have every seen.  There is no secret ""cool"" person waiting to be let out.  They are just wonderful, lovable, dorks.  Plot?  Asking a girl to the dance; Pedro running for class president; Kip's social calendar of online chat; Rico's attempt to make a living selling door to door, along with attempting to find a time machine so he can relive the one good moment in his life back in high school.  Nothing more; nothing less.  But it adds up to a lovely movie.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3PIMCV8GEDYUP	A. Meyer	I'm quite sure what to make of Napoleon...Napoleon Dynamite chronicles the life of a quirky teenager as he manages a unique home life, a budding romance, and a presidential campaign at his high school.  It is not the typical movie, and this is the strongest point.  In an era where most popular movies rely on special effects or gratuitous sex to entertain, Napoleon Dynamite employs neither.However, other movie standards, like a moving plotline or even a story, are not present.  Despite, or maybe because of these shifts, the random and dry humor of the movie shines through.  The characters are unbelievably unique and at the same time familiar.  The acting is convincing, making these incredibly random characters completely believable.I end this review with a warning; Napoleon Dynamite is not the typical blockbuster.  If you put the DVD in your player with those expectations, you are sure to be entertained by Napoleon Dynamite.	4.0	A movie worth seeing.	2004-12-26	6	6	0

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AYPCUQS6ARWFH	"Andre M. ""brnn64"""	"Granted, this ""revenge of the nerds of the millennium"" is NOT for everybody, but I'm certainly one of those who find it funny as hell, and a tad charming.For one thing, it takes time to warm up to this film. A lot of really strange vignettes happen in the first half hour that really don't make a lot of sense (our man throwing a toy with a string on it out of a school bus window and watching it drag along the road, a farmer shooting a cow (offscreen, thank goodness) for no apparant reason, Napoleon and Pedro's female friend shyly attempting to sell Napoleon some junk, etc). Plus, the actors playing Napoleon and his best friend Pedro Sanchez look WAY too old to be in high school.But after you sit through this with some patience, the ""story"" begins to hang together. Bascially, it's a really SWEET (as Napoleon would say) story of the bonds of friendship being established among social outcasts. Also, it's chock full of wild catch phrases (such as the title of this review) with deadpan delivery that you can't help but shout out at repeated viewings.Of course, there are bound to be ultrasensitive over PC need-to-get-a-life types who will criticize this movie for some ethnic stereotyping. Here I refer to Pedro Sanchez himself and his admittedly hackneyed Mexican-American accent, Pedro's lowriding (apparently) gangbanging cousins, and LaFawnda, the Detroit ghetto queen who Napoleon's brother falls in love with over the internet. As an African-American myself, I would have to say that this is not ""Soul Plane"" or the ""Frito Bandito."" These characters are likeable people who, beneath the superficial cultural differences, anybody could relate to. Plus, LaFawnda (unlike the overtly ghetto fabulous/slum pitiful sisters of UPN and BET) has a touch of class about herself and a good heart (in her advice to Napoleon in particular). As for Pedro, he's a fish out of water that is also a very sympathetic character.But overall, anyone who has ever felt like they've been on the outside of humanity looking in (and who hasn't felt that way from time to time?) could realte to at least something this film, so see it. There's a reason why so many people are wearing all those ""Vote For Pedro"" t-shirts. After all, you too could drink whole milk if you wanted to!

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2SLA0SXRQV8M0	Andres C. Salama	In a godforsaken small town in Idaho, Napoleon Dynamite, the nerd to end all nerds, tries to survive high school. Harassed by the school bullies, ignored by the girls, living in a dysfunctional family consisting of his thirty years old brother, his hospitalized grandmother and the con man of his uncle, he clings to his only friend in school, the Mexican immigrant Pedro, and Debbie (Tina Majorino, who made some hit films as a child actress during the 1990s and returns to a major film after a decade), who for some mysterious reason might be attracted to him. When Pedro decides to run for school president, Napoleon Dynamite sees this as an opportunity for revenge from the rest of his class. Napoleon Dynamite seems the impossible: an outrageously funny teen comedy with zero references to sexual humor or bodily functions (maybe this has to do with the writer director being a Mormon). At first, I didn't like the movie much, as most of the jokes were at Napoleon's expense, looking as if the director was joining the bullies. But it very soon warms up to his character. It does have a resemblance to some of the movies of Todd Solondz, but without the self-hate and with a much saner sense of humor.	4.0	Very funny teen comedy	2008-02-28	1	0	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3HU0B9XUEVHIM	"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle"""	Napoleon Dynamite is the name of this movie AND the lead character depicted on the front.What IS this movie?Well,like 'Seinfield' this is a show about nothing.None of the events have,or are ever designed to have any significant social meaning.It's the story about a painfully mundane small town social outcast Napoleon who lives with his 32 year old brother Kipling,thrill seeking grandmother and is visited by his screwed up uncle Rico.His school chum is the kind but empty headed Pedro who's actions actually constitute for some of the films better moments.Even Napoleon's various attempts to find a girlfriend.Events such as Pedro's funny wig and bizzare attempt to become class president,as well as Rico's equally eccentric money making scemes produce some funny moments.Also Kiplings HIGHLY unlikely 'internet girlfriend' Lafawnda and Napoleans highly skillfull dance during Pedro's campaign,in winter boots no less are also great chestnuts.And of course this dance came about due mainly to a 'D Qwuan' dance instruction video purchased at a Goodwill.As you have noticed this is a very offbeat comedy because there is no real point to it all-all the characters are so painfully ordinary and yes-almost boring that their very dullness is what is so humerous.It's a film made up of very funny moments and even if many of the lead characters (namely Napoleon and Pedro) are certainly not the sharpest tools in the shed they both have big hearts and try to do their best.And if this movie has any point at all it's that no matter how unattractive you or your general demeaner are (such as is the case with Napoleon)that if you try to care about others around you that you will do okay in the end.	5.0	Dancing In Winter Boots	2005-07-06	2	1	1

Scary as that sounds, it's true.Keep in mind that Napoleon doesn't represent any one individual, but bits and pieces of many personalities thrown into a blender to produce one funny character with just a few quirks.This is a film that all will love in either one of two ways.  You will either love loving it or love hating it.  With this film, there just is no inbetween.I watched it with a big group of teens and it was funny both watching the film and watching their reactions to it.

He is obviously a very big fan.It can be safely said that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is not a typical Hollywood production.  Rather it is a dead pan comedy that runs very much counter to what one might expect of an American film.Napoleon is a sixteen year old nerd attending high school in the back blocks of Idaho - beautiful scenery but relentlessly boring in terms of lifestyle.  He is picked on at school and clearly doesn't fit in.  His only friend is an alienated Mexican also trying to come to grips with mid west America.  However, together they ultimately succeed despite Napoleon also having to deal with his dysfunctional family.  He has a crazy thrill seeking grandmother, a loser geek brother and an uncle whose mind still dwells in 1982.  Yet, somehow, this bizarre mix is conquered.Despite protestations from my son, I'm unable to give this film more than three stars.  Perhaps it's me that doesn't fit in?  For a film that started out at art house cinemas it quickly went mainstream and with generally positive reviews.

The volume was blaring and I just so happened to walk in when Rex the television sensai was offering his $300 eight-week program. Kip and Napoleon's reaction to the $300 instantly had me hooked.

The vague idea of a battle between the ""popular kids"" and the ""geeks"" is present throughout, but is not really the main focus of the film.  Napoleon Dynamite is more like a collection of various scenes from the odd life of one very strange boy.  The film reaches its peak with the student body president elections and the unconventional self-actualization of Napoleon himself.This film is, on the surface, a comedy geared towards a teenaged audience.  But, as the saying goes, this is not another teen movie.  It is refreshing in its originality.  Many teen films glorify the underdogs and the unpopular kids, but Napoleon Dynamite delves deep into the existence of those real people, the stereotypical ""freaks and geeks"", making no apologies for the great amount of painful awkwardness and cringe-worthy moments.Compared to other top movies of the season, Napoleon Dynamite may or may not be a worthy competitor.  It certainly has uniqueness going for it, not to mention an enormous cult following in both the teen and college age groups.  However, it may not appeal outside of the trendy, offbeat scene because it lacks typical blockbuster appeal.  While some see the film's lack of profanity, sex, or violence as a positive thing, this type of good clean fun doesn't always sell.So what is Napoleon Dynamite really trying to tell us?  While the aforementioned ""power to the unpopular"" message is strong and loud, the film is by no means a tear-jerking homage to the little guys.  It seems to strive more for a good laugh and a quotably fun time with your friends.  However, the audience is not laughing at Napoleon so much as they are enjoying the fact that the main character can be so glaringly ""un-cool"" and still be so... cool!  The lovers of this film want to be Napoleon, and so the message becomes one of encouragement to revel in your own originality.  It's cool to be a dork now.If you are surrounded by fans of this movie who quote it all day long and can't seem to talk about anything else, then you might have been avoiding it.  You may be thinking that it can't be all that great... And no one seems to be able to put their finger on exactly what makes this movie so fabulous.  In truth, Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies that you will either love or hate.  So is it worth your time and money?  Absolutely.  There's a chance that it will be your favorite movie ever.  And if it's not, at least you got to see what all the fuss is about."	5.0	Napoleon Dynamite: Not Another Teen Movie.	2005-02-23	8	5	3

Neither of these is a reason to waste your time watching the movie, much less be obsessed with this film. Watching a dog do it's business or watching paint dry is more fun.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A18SLX1JESM0EX	A reviewer in Atlanta	Okay, I'm going to admit right up front: I only watched the first half-hour of this movie.  My stomach wouldn't take anymore.  During the 30 minutes I watched, this movie never evoked as much as a slight smile, much less a laugh.  Maybe it's the fact that I'm over 40 and actually enjoy plot in a movie.  Perhaps this is something for the reality show crowd.  Perhaps this movie actually had something later with some merit, but I'll never know.  I don't buy or rent a movie to enjoy only the last 15 or 20 minutes.  I expect the whole movie to be at least somewhat entertaining.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3HWCK7TSEBR3P	"A Sacramento Reader ""Sacto-Skeptic"""	I watched this movie with a group of friends who are all over 40 and had seen it before.  They thought it was absolutely hilarious.  I wanted to go to bed after 10 minutes.  There was nothing clever, fresh, interesting, or funny.  It's an oddly predictable flick about a group of dysfunctional, unlovable losers who finally win out over the typical, beautiful-people snobs at the small-town high school.  Because I was with friends who thought they were doing me a favor, I had to restrain from yawning and checking my watch.  I kept waiting for laughs that never came.  It was like watching a film written by high school kids working on their first script, or one of those tediously long SNL skits (but I repeat myself).  By the end, I could sympathize with Alex from CLOCKWORK ORANGE who was forced to watch videos with his eyelids forced open.I like oddball comedy, such as RAISING ARIZONA, Monty Python, and the like.  But this thing wasn't oddball; it was sLOWball.Judging by the other reviews, I'm much in the minority on this one.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1I9DQA9HCQKBR	Ashley Allinson	"Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is, without question, the sleeper comedy of the year.  Influenced by Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Paul Feig's ""Freaks and Geeks"", Napoleon Dynamite is a study in isolation that clearly distances itself from the two.  Napoleon, played by newcomer Jon Herder, is a quirky geek from rural Idaho who, like many before him within the genre, has problems relating to others.  His obvious disregard for the way in which others view him, including the audience, isolates him further.  The fact is that Napoleon Dynamite is a character study that never actually studies a character.It nestles itself within the genre of alienated teen comedy by taking 85 minutes to deliver and repeat a one liner.  Situations present themselves whereby Napoleon is put on the spot.  His obvious disregard for how others receive his words deliver the joke, as there are no consequences for his action.  Things here stay stagnant, a journey that takes us nowhere except to the realization that we are laughing out loud, situation after situation.What distinguishes this film from others within the genre is that there is no revenge from this nerd; there isn't even any change in his disposition.  Rather, Jared Hess takes us through a week in the life of a geek leading up to the prom.  The anxiety pertaining to this, as seen in so many other films, is totally underdeveloped, which works.To suggest that Napoleon is comfortable with the way he handles himself is an understatement, but i guess that is fitting since this film is a total understatement.  Despite being the center of attention, he does not allow a possible error in judgment to affect him. The audience laughs at him the same way his onscreen peers laugh at him. Napoleon remains unshaken, it truly doesn't stir him.Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy that is quirky enough to keep you entertained from start to finish, even though you end up in exactly the same place."	4.0	IDIOT	2005-01-19	2	2	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2WX1UESDOLXRE	"Ashley Quinn ""Ash"""	"Oh my gosh, this movie is so weird. It floats along, aimless most of the time, yet in some odd way it kept my attention for the 90 minutes it ran. I do like Napoleon Dynamite. He's such a dork-- he's flippin' clueless and, what other reasons do you need, God! That's the way he talks. It's actually pretty funny!Without John Heder, I don't think this movie could have survived or gained the momentum that it did. He IS Napoleon. Anyone else would have just been way under par. So Napoleon lives with his grandmother, his nerdy skinny brother, and a pet llama named Tina. He meets Pedro, a new kid a school and Deb, a shy girl who ""left all her crap on [his] porch,"" an assortment of bracelets and what not. They float along together, as Napoleon battles his Uncle Rico, tries to get dates, and also attmpets to elect Pedro as president of the school.Hard to say whether or not you'll like this. My punk rocking sister loved it. My dad enjoys movies overall and called it ""quirky."" Which usually means he liked it. My mom hated it, but she's apt to dislike any comedy unless it has Jim Carrey in it. I liked this one. It's weird, but Napoleon was too interesting for me to turn it off. It was fun being in his world for 90 minutes. Give it a try sometime."	4.0	Love It or Leave It?? Hmmm....	2004-12-24	3	2	1

I wanted to see just what was so special about this movie. Best I can say after watching the whole thing is....Huh? This movie seems to be one of those ""If you don't like it, you are just too un-cool"". Hence, all the kids at school are jumping on the bandwagon since they want to be cool for seeing ND. I wish all of the praisers of this film would quit making it out to be something it isn't. There is NO deeper meaning or abstract message to be gleaned from it.This has to be probably THE stupidest movie I have ever seen!  It is completely void of ANY redeeming qualities.

For the longest time I didn't see it because I saw the commercials and it didn't look interesting in the least bit...add on to that every stupid quote from this movie everyone and their brother kept spewing and it didn't really fuel my desire to watch it.  Finally my brother went out and bought the DVD.What a complete and utter waste of my time.I wanted to shut it off less than twenty minutes into it, but I kept watching it hoping that something...ANYTHING...would be in the least bit funny.  Never happened.  However, there were several times when someone started to say something that sounded like it was about to be kind of funny...but then the movie would cut to something else.The movie isn't even slightly entertaining, either...it's dull and pointless.  There's no plot at all, horrible acting, and all the main characters act EXACTLY the same...dull and emotionless, with absolutely no distinction between them.I don't know...maybe I just don't get the humor, but to me, watching some clod with a squint breathe heavily into the camera after saying some stupid thing that everyone's going to repeat while his effeminate brother and sleazy uncle sell Tupperware doesn't really tickle my funnybone much.This movie is called a ""deadpan"" comedy?  No.  Monty Python is deadpan humor.  Leslie Nielson is deapan humor.  This movie is devoid of anything even remotely resembling humor of any kind.  Basically, this movie is what you get when a lot of really untalented people get together and make a comedy without really trying.I think this movie was trying to pioneer a new style of comedy...and I really hope it doesn't catch on.  I don't think I could handle another movie like this without assaulting anyone and everyone who had anything to do with it.I heard people say that they didn't even know what was happening most of the movie because they were laughing so hard.

For a long time, I keep hearing people talking about the movie, certain scenes, and laughing until their on the floor about things I didn't know about. Why it took me so long to get on the Napoleon train, I have no idea. But it's now officially over. I have been Napoleoned, and there is no going back. Now I join everyone else, proud of my wisdom in all things Napoleon. It's good to be a member of the club. The film itself?. All I have got to say is that the writer and director of the movie must of been nerds in high school, or at least knew someone who was. Their depiction of Napoleon, and High School in general, is so specific and spot on, that it must of come from both of their lives. That's how good this movie is. Jon Heder plays Napoleon, the biggest geek you ever saw, who lives with his grandmother and older brother Kip(who I swear plays Weigel's serial killer boyfriend on ""Reno 911""). They live in some no name, bodunk Idaho town, that's just as forgettable as the people who live in it. The look of the movie is worth noting as well. The people in the movie are plain, and their environments accompany them. The movie is shot well to go with the people. Whoever scouted this location for the film has a nice eye. But what is the movie really about?. Not sure. There's not so much of a plot going here, just an observance of life. A peek into the life of this nerdy high schooler and the people who populate his existence. But Napoleon does have some missions. Get his new friend, Pedro, elected as class president, and to get a date to the prom. The boys' uncle(played by Jon Gries, wig and all)comes to look over them too. Tina Majorino also appears as the girl who likes Napoleon, and he likewise. She was so real and believeable in her role. The acting and characterizations are done to a T. The movie and people are so real, that you expect to drive to this Idaho town and really find them. That's good praise to the writing and acting of this film. Heder is a marvel. Where did he come from?. He's amazing. He brings this character to life in a way I have never seen a character, nerd or otherwise, achieve. The movie may not be for everyone's taste, but it is worth checking out and sticking it out to the end for. There are so many good scenes, and this has to be the most quoteable movie to come along in a very long time. The film's humor is sometimes odd, sometimes subtle, but always very funny. I am catching new things I didn't notice the first time I saw it. No doubt about it, Napoleon Dynamite is like no other. It's charm, characters, and way of life, is all it's own.

Then take out the perspective you have on those moments-- you don't see how uncomfortable they are.  What can you do but love these characters?I never found their treatment to be condescending or pitiful.  Uncomfortable sometimes, but not as uncomfortable as, say, a lot of Michael Moore moments.  These characters have good hearts, and the film promotes an appreciation for that above appearances and social graces.Boring?  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  Sometimes because it was like a train wreck, sometimes because the teen plot moments caught me up.

It's hard to summarize what is so good about this movie.This movie is unique. Forget the plot; it is a character study of very small town America. The humour is in the ridiculous traits and behavior of some of these desparate people. It's somewhere between Green Acres and Fargo with the charm and low budget, non-Hollywood appeal of Home Alone and the Gods Must be Crazy.Don't take it too seriously. This movie is extremely funny; you won't be able to get these characters out of your mind for a long time. In fact the thing that stuck me the most was 'where did they get these actors'. Napoleon, Kip, Rico and Lafawndah are brilliant in their roles. Like 'George McFly' in Back to the Future they are just hilarious to listen to and look at.

Just the look of Napoleon's face (""You better watch it; it's the greatest movie ever"" or something like that) was enough to send me into hysterical laughter.It's plotless; completly pointless, I am totally admitting. But the way it revolves around Napoleon's strange and twisted life, from his stay-at-home, Internet-obsessed older brother to his out-and-about grandmother and his living-in-the-past uncle (1982? Need I say more?), I found myself not looking for a plot. Simply observing the way they lived and engaged with other people was so hysterical I didn't even think of a plot (save for Pedro's race against Summer).Napoleon Dynamite is confusing. It has a kind of dry humor that I haven't really seen in many other kinds of films. Personally, Napoleon wasn't the easiest character to love; he often barked at family members and randomly expected people to do orders for him (which is later explained in the DVD commentary), but in the end I found myself rooting for Napoleon as he won over his school during Pedro's skit.Before I end, I'd like to personally address reviewer Donna who totally criticised the movie over the Mexican ""racism."" I am Mexican and found absolutely nothing offensive. It appears to me that you don't watch absolutely any TV since that is how most Mexicans are portrayed and while I don't act like that at all, I do know many who do just like in the movie(s). This movie isn't trying to make a point. It's just trying to be funny; it's not trying to piss anybody off.I highly recommened this film. While some may not immediately understand the film's rather dry sense of humor, those who do take part in it will eventually see it and find themselves laughing all the way."	5.0	"""Revenge of the Nerds"" for the new generation"	2004-12-31	8	8	0

I borrowed Napoleon Dynamite from my brothers vast DVD collection. I had no idea what the movie was about but my students told me it was funny. I looked it up on IMDB to see its rating. It is PG because of the word ""piss"" and a man selling breast enlargement pills. Pretty tame stuff in this day and age.I watched it three times in one day. The first viewing I was confused...it did not seem that funny. The second and third time I watched it I just laughed and laughed through out the whole movie.It grows on you, and you will find yourself laughing about lines from the movie at odd times through out your life.I do recommend this movie.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1OVHSWSWPOW5C	"Benjamin M. Bell ""literary mind"""	"What's the one truly ironic thing about ""professional"" film critics?... Almost none of them have ever been an actor,a director, a cinematographer, or screen writer. Doesn't it strike anyone as peculiar, then, that these men and women consider themselves to be the world's foremost authorities in film-making and dramatic liscense? To put it simply, those who can, do... Those who can't, critique. Perhaps they're just jealous.Napoleon Dynamite looks at the duller, more common world of teen-aged life. Where ""Sixteen Candles"" took all of the dramatic moments of high school-itis and crammed it into one film, ""Napoleon"" chose to focus on the more mundane, nauseating moments of the coming-of-age years. The main character was an amalgam of those closeted mal-contents of whom we were all critical in high school. And while I agree that there wasn't really a plot throughout the film, neither was there ever any point to what REALLY happened in high school. In that sense, Napolean Dynamite is more realistic than any other film about adolescence that we've been fed over the last 25 years.I will admit that when I watched it the first time, I was fairly uncomfortable because I just didn't get it. It seemed gawdy, pointless, and a bit disquieting. Almost Immediately upon my second viewing, however, everything began to make sense. The fact is, there was really nothing to ""get."" It was there for pure enjoyment and gave it's audience the opportunity to look back and remember a time when absolutely NOTHING made sense.In the end, watching Napoleon ""cut a rug"" on stage, I was also filled with a powerful message:  that anyone, even the most unlikely people, can have their day in the sun.As a side-note, let me remind those meandering critics that there isn't one person I've spoken to(educated or otherwise) who didn't thoroughly enjoy this film. Perhaps you all need to forget about selling your column and buy back your soul. Maybe then you'll be more in tune with your readers.

When one of my friends told me about it, he had a hard time to get the words out because he was laughing so hard, just thinking of it. Another friend said that I would be a complete loser if I didn't see it. When I finally saw it, there were pretty funny parts. I did laugh alot and I did some what enjoy it. The reason that I didn't like it is because it wasn't nearly as funny as I had hoped it to be. There were times where I thought to my self, ""Am I supposed to laugh here?"" and I also kept one eye on the timer to see how much longer there was. Overall, though, I wasn't as happy with the presentation of the movie and the thoughtfullness of it all. There were times where I knew it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. Also, the direction was somewhat inconsistent. At times the flavor of a scene would be surreal, but then cut to something else in the same scene which wasn't surreal at all. The move was a dissapoint to me after all the hype about it, but overall it was a better movie than, say, Garfield."	3.0	Semi- Funny	2005-02-03	7	1	6

This movie lives or dies depending upon whether or not you like the characters. What you see is what you get. If you think Napoleon is funny, then you'll like this movie. If you like dry, subtle comedy based on the actions and mannerisms of the key characters rather than some contrived situations they find themselves in, then you'll like this movie.And it takes a few minutes to get into the groove. But once you get it (if you do) then you're hooked.So if you need to be force-fed comedy (like TV sit coms) then you probably won't like this movie.	4.0	"You either ""get it"" or you don't"	2005-01-05	7	3	4

It's not your typical coming of age film as it's set in Idaho and none of the actors are glamorous in any way.  Regardless, there are qualities displayed with which we can all relate.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3O1SQX7N1MCWK	"B. Hempton ""Movie Expert"""	When asked what my favorite movie of the year is, it's no contest here. Napolean Dynamite easily surpasses anything that has been out so far, and I'm sure, anything yet to come. The best comedy I've seen since Office Space, I'd say. Any bad reviews are to be ignored. It's one of those films where a plot simply isn't necessary, and you almost forget there isn't one until walking out of the theatre. The humor is so dry and random, not to mention the hilarious elevator music that seems to correspond with the crazy nature of the film. The charactar I most enjoyed was Kip, because his transition from dork to gangster was so enjoyable, and somehow managed to be believeable as well. Just the tone of his voice was enough to keep me in stitches. I also think Summer (Haylee Duff), was especially great to watch on screen in her role. You instantly saw her as every Summer you may have had in your school, and automatically rooted for her demise. Yes, I'd go so far as to say this movie is about to become a cult classic.	5.0	Napolean Is Dynamite	2004-10-06	156	114	42

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3TI7FBUI11YEW	Bill	"I'll be honest, the first time I watched this movie, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen, while my friend (who recommended we watch it together) was laughing his head off.  I realized that it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just wasn't getting it.  I was expecting some really silly slapstick power comedy.  I really thought to myself I never ever want to see this movie again.Fast forward a few months later, and I end up forced to sit through it again.  I think during that time I had seen a couple more movies with Jon Heder which I really enjoyed, like ""School for Scoundrels"" and ""The Benchwarmers.""  So I guess I had become accustomed to his acting.  I couldn't believe that I was finding this movie entertaining the second time around.  I guess I was a little bit looser and more open-minded than I was the first time.  It's not one of those comedies that make you laugh until your side hurts, and your face muscles are fatigued from smiling.  But Jon Heder's dorkiness does grow on you after a while.I think if you go into this movie without expecting too much as far as comedy or story line, because there basically isn't any, and you have an open mind, you'll probably be ok.  Otherwise you may be feeling the same way I felt the first time.  This is a pretty decent flick if you don't really have anything better to do, or if you want to be watching TV, but there's nothing on... except maybe this movie on FX or USA.  Because once you start watching it, it's kinda hard to pull away from it, because of the ""I can't believe I'm actually watching this crap"" phenomenon.This is supposed to be entertainment, not meant to be a seemingly ""true to life"" story or characters.  Because it is anything but that.  No one is this dorky you would think, but you know, somewhere out there in the world, there probably is and you just don't know them.  It is meant to push the boundarys of dorkiness, dweebiness, and stupidity.  Take it for what it's worth, and don't expect anything deep, or real, or yes you will indeed be disappointed.As much as this movie has grown on me, I didn't have the heart to give it 5 stars, but I do ""like"" the movie."	4.0	A very strange movie to say the least.	2011-09-21	1	1	0

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3HWLQ069Y5PHR	B. in Edmonton	I wasn't sure what to expect when I put this DVD in the player. In the first 15 minutes I was expecting the typical comedy to script itself out. After about 20 minutes I realized that I was watching a movie about nothing, and that it was all about the characters, and the story was only about the way things happened in this place at this time. There was no plot, no story, no revelations...it was just about the people. And the people were people that I knew. People that everybody knows and people that everybody is. We knew these people and the recollection either makes us happy or makes us cringe because we remember how we reacted to them...Gosh.While the script probably shouldn't be given Oscar consideration, it is too bad that the actors won't be. There should be nominations here for lead actor and at least 2 supporting, but that ain't gonna happen. It's really sad. Because &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; wasn't a mainstream movie, the performances here will be ignored for others of lesser merit.	5.0	Should be some Oscar nominations here.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AHCVWPLA1O4X8	bixodoido	Wow, this movie came out of nowhere.  At a time when Hollywood churns out the same predictable plots and bombards us with flat characters, Napoleon Dynamite delivers.  This is a movie about a nobody who does nothing, and that is why it succeeds to such a great extent.  Napoleon is the perennial loser, an unpopular kid in a small (and sometimes backward) town where nothing ever seems to happen.  This is what makes him such a compelling hero-he's the antithesis of the hard-bodied, perfect smiling hunk from the Hollywood cookie-cutter factory that we're constantly expected to relate toThe biggest complaint I've heard of this movie is that nothing happens.  This is absolutely true-nothing really happens through the course of the film.  There's not much action, nothing blows up, there is no outrageous crime or anything like that.  What there IS is a heartwarming story about a smalltown kid trying to make a small difference in his smalltown world.  The characters are hilarious and very well rounded, and the movie is incredibly funny by simple virtue of its simplicity.  Go into this movie with no expectations and you'll be very pleasantly surprised-go in expecting drama or action and you'll probably be disappointed.	5.0	A great movie about nothing at all	2006-06-12	5	2	3

Napoleon Dynamite made me laugh so hard, at times I thought I would pass out.This film is a video yearbook of high school for the kids who were not the jocks and cheerleaders.  It is not an uproariously funny film, but is such an accurate portrayal of real high school life, with all of the subversive idiosyncrasies of teenagers.  The characters are vibrant and real.  Even the extras wear their personalities and hearts on their sleeves.  The film is obviously a work of love by the Hess brothers and the town of Preston, Idaho.Naysayers, take my advice, don't put it off any longer, and buy this DVD.

I hadn't heard a whole lot about it nor did I recognize anybody in it, but that's not surprising for an indie flick. I had heard somewhere that this movie, along with ""The Incredibles"" were the 2 best movies of the year. I had also read someone's review that likened it to a ""teenage Wes Anderson"" movie, to which I sure as heck hoped not, as I have tried twice to watch ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" only to abandon the effort both times. So, ready for anything, I sat down to watch it.Well, I have to say I laughed pretty much throughout ""Napoleon Dynamite"". This movie is definitely not for everybody, but I didn't find it to be anything close to a Wes Anderson movie except for the dead-pan humor. I kept waiting to see what the main character Napoleon Dynamite, played superbly by Jon Heder, with his very odd delivery, would say next. Everything that came out of this ubernerd's mouth was pretty funny, actually. I even thought the supporting characters were pretty good. There's not a great deal of plot here, but in this movie, I don't think plot development was the main goal. If anything, it's a very well-done, if slightly bizzare, character study, and I was totally entertained the entire time.I loved this movie, but I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up totally hating it either. It just depends on what particular vein your sense of humor is geared towards. A lot of people are not going to like this movie. And that's fine if you don't.

It's basically just occurrences in the life of a guy named Napoleon Dynamite, who is pretty much an incredibly obvious nerd that is sort of his own person and doesn't care what others think of him. Commendable aspects of this movie were that it was outstandingly hilarious, in fact I think there are never any periods of three minutes or more in the movie that go without an amusing comment from Napoleon. One such amusing comment is when Napoleon is asked by a kid on his bus what he is going to do today and he replies ""Whatever I feel like doing! Gosh!"" when it is indeed not quite obvious what he is going to be doing.

His new found buddy Pedro and he compete, to some extent anyway, for the affection of the same girl.  Napolean's uncle babysits while his grandma's hurt from an ATV accident and buys a time machine.

If you have a short attention span, little patience, or if  you're looking for a movie with in-yer-face profanity, skin or violence - basically, if you don't understand what 'subtlety' means, then you'll most likely agree with the people who gave this movie low marks.This is a movie of subtleties, folks. I watched it twice before I laughed at certain parts (usually those involving Uncle Rico, Deb or Kip, not Napoleon). In my opinion, it's not the laugh out loud type of film that some promote it to be. It's more of a human observation film.The casting was perfect. The acting was skillful, especially when you watch the physical ineptitude of Kip and Napoleon.I don't think we were supposed to love Napoleon's dismissive, damaged demeanor. Ultra shy Deb barely talks, and then talks with her mouth full. Uncle Rico is lost to a fading dream. Kip can be sadistic (review the 'time machine' sequence - he knew what was going to happen). These aren't cutesy characters you are going to warm to right away.But the go back and look at Napoleon when he gets stood up at the dance. There's no blatant show of disappointment, but you can tell the guy is hurt.Nobody tells Napoleon or Pedro that a skit is expected after Pedro's speech. Almost everyone wants Pedro to lose. Like a true friend, Napoleon steps in and helps Pedro out - he 'has his back'.When Napoleon watches Kip carrying Lafawnduh's luggage onto the bus, he even manages his only smile in the movie.They weren't using sledgehammers to get the point across.In the end, I think the point is that there is hope for everyone, even the hopeless.	5.0	Naysayers don't know what they're looking at	2006-04-10	9	9	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ	Boggman!	"This movie is absolutely brilliant! Anyone who doesn't think so has lost all touch with what it is like to be in high school, or what genuine comedy is! Without any sex, drugs, or profanity this movie rises to the top with it's humor and magnificently subtle performances (lets not forget the soundtrack), which I have not seen a non animated movie do in years!I do not believe audiences are judging or looking down on the characters in this film at all- in fact, if anything they are relating to them! Everyone has known and can relate to at least 1 (and more than likely ALL in some way ) of the characters in this film. Who hasn't known someone like these characters when they were in school?? This was 2004's biggest surprise hit, and I think it went underated with many people.When I saw this movie in the theater, I can not remember the last time I sat down in a packed theater that just erupted with laughter for an hour and a half (and it was just as funny when I bought the DVD). This movie really takes you back to those ""school days"" (and I hated school) with a great fondness.Some people have said that the movie doesn't have a plot-- but that is simply NOT true. It has SEVERAL sub plots that intertwine together nicely. This film will go down as a ""cult"" classic without any doubt. Truly the funniest movie I have seen in years that you could watch with strangers, spouse, kids, & friends of all ages and get a real kick out of.2 BIG THUMBS UP FOR NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE!!!MAKE SURE YOU WATCH ALL THE WAY THROUGH UNTIL THE END OF THE  CREDITS FOR A 5-10 MINUTE SHORT FOLLOW UP OF WHAT HAPPENS TO KIP!!!"	5.0	My lips hurt reeeal bad!	2005-03-23	3	2	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ABARNA66MT43U	Bonemonkey	What an absolute gem this film is. Napoleon Dynamite is a nerd. He has nothing and I do mean nothing going for him, at all. He gets ignored or crapped on at school every day. His family make his life unbearable every day, and nobody will play ball on a rope with him, ever! Even so he remains convinced that by perfecting his skills he will come out on top. The skills include drawing animals and potential prom dates portraits. He would like to have nunchuck skills and be able to catch some sweet air on his friends bike, but he can't. He has zero social skills. He hangs up the phone on people before they know the conversation is over. He keeps oven crunchies in his pocket to eat later. He really is beyond help in every way imaginable. But does he care. Nope. His grandma likes to race buggies out in the desert. His uncle is a door to door salesman who's obsessed with his failed high school football career. His brother revolves his life around internet chat rooms and gradually becomes the geekiest gangster pimp ever. His best and only friend has the only mostache in school and on this basis, runs for the school election.It's impossible to describe the feel and nature of this film because there is really nothing to compare it to. You really have to just watch it and experience something different. I can see how some people don't get it and think its a pile of crap, but I really liked it. It's a real feel good movie but without being cheesy or wet. It's got the funniest script - &#34;do the chickens have large talons?&#34;.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1JEWNBAYDSQBO	Bonnie Burton	"Very rarely do movies compel me to watch them multiple times. But in the case of ""Napoleon Dynamite."" I saw the movie 4 times in the theater (twice for the new wedding ending) and 3 times on DVD. I think the first time I saw it I was with friends who thought it would be a cross between ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Sixteen Candles."" It's not.It takes place in the director/co-writer's (Jared Hess) hometown of Preston, Idaho -- a town where time forgot. Sure there's the Internet for Kip to chat online with babes. But everyone dresses like Sears hasn't gotten any new clothes since 1987. The characters are something out of a David Lynch movie, without the horror. If Jerri Blank from ""Stangers With Candy"" had a fmaily just like her, this would be it. Nerdy just doesn't do it justice. What makes this film endearing and addictive probably has something to do with the fact that all the weird little moments in the film are based on things that really did happen to the director growing up in rural Idaho.So here's my list of interesting trivia and reasons why you should get this flick, now!* Best opening credits ever using condiments and school supplies to spell out cast and crew names!* The actor who plays the lead of Napoleon Dynamite -- Jon Heder -- actually drew all those bizarre sketches of unicorns farting, ligers and the portrait of the girl he asked to prom.* Big Jakes -- best strawberry shakes you'll ever down -- in Preston.* All Uncle Rico consumes during the film is steak and milk. The actor who plays him -- Jon Gries -- is a vegetarian who hated milk.* Check out the tacky retro decor in the Dynamite home -- lots of odd wallpaper, dual portaits, and a bobcat hide on the wall.* Longest telephone cord EVER!* Ebay-bought time machine or torture device?* A closer look at what it takes to earn a ribbon from the FFA!* Napoleon's t-shirt collection is IMPRESSIVE! And let us not forget the moonboots!* Rex Kwon Do!* Happy Hands Club!* Music in the film includes White Stripes, old-school Cyndi Lauper, Money Mark and tons of odd Woolsworth type tunes.* Teatherball!* Tina the llama (the director's mom's llama).* D-Qwon's Dance Moves are really moves improved by actor Jon Heder. Check out those spirit fingers!* Vote for Pedro A-Team montage!* Kip's love song: ""Yes, I love technology/But not as much as you, you see.""Plus you'll learn more about this and more in the commentary which is more than worth a listen!

I watched it all the way through and I thought it was strange.  Later that evening, I decided to watch it all the way through again and I saw what everyone else is seeing.  This movie is great.  There are two ways you can take it: seriously and humorously (I did at the same time) I think we all have a little of Napoleon in us..so it's easy to relate to Jon Heder's character (which, he is perfect for..just looking at him made me laugh, so does the tone of his voice) For those reviewers that said this movie was the biggest waste of time and lacked humor, I beg to differ. (I can think of movies that are much, much worse) I would recommend this as a rental since most people either love it or hate it, but I can see this winning a spot in lots of DVD collections.

Fortunately, I had no expectations at all for this movie, and ended up thinking it was hilarious.I don't know where to start...Napoleon's brother is SUCH a dweeb you'll want to smack him yourself---yet I'm laughing even now thinking about him.  There are all these subtle continuity errors and era-inappropriate artifacts that are so obvious they had to be intentional, and even those still make me laugh.But the real reason the movie is funny is because most of the characters are so incredibly pathetic they'll remind you, sometimes quite painfully, of real people.  Some parts almost make you cringe that way.If you're looking for something a little different, and if you can sit down to watch this without any particular expectations, you might accidentally get a huge kick out of it.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A328O2CSG6HXDT	"Brian Williams ""word nerd"""	"It seems that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has a very pronounced polarizing effect on viewers--you either love it or hate it. In my opinion, a film that can elicit such strong responses in an audience (for better or for worse) is worth its salt. Any movie can lull an audience into feeling a predetermined emotion, be it patriotic fervor, paranoia, lust, or nostalgia, and sometimes these movies can be very well done (but often they're two-dimensional cookie-cutter affairs). However, Napoleon Dynamite is one of a tiny group of films that remain emotionally open-ended. Reviewers condemn its ""lack of plot"" and bland texture, but it is only plotless and bland in the sense that you have to do a little thinking and connecting with your own life and experience to appreciate it. And maybe you won't. Maybe it hits a little too close to home, and you'd rather reject it. Maybe Ebert was right (in a sense), and you'll either pity Napoleon or, as several reviewers have proclaimed, want to beat the stuffing out of him (these people are called bullies, and one of them features prominently in the film).Suffice it to say, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is nuanced. It requires patience and understanding and empathy--there are no explosions or conspiracy theories or crude jokes. It reminded me of Wes Anderson's movies (""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""The Life Aquatic""), especially the polarized audience effect. Watch it for the subtle details, the facial expressions, the pauses for effect. Napoleon, Pedro, Deb, and Kip are average Americans--they are like you and me--we all have quirks, shortcomings, a certain level of geekiness (try as we might to cover it up or pretend otherwise; let's admit it, we're on here reviewing movies). So if you can see the humor in everyday life and laugh at yourself, you'll enjoy ""Napoleon Dynamite."""	5.0	I want to: (A) be Napoleon's friend; (B) run far away from him; (C) beat the stuffing out of him.	2006-11-14	2	1	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	One of the more absurd movies of the decade, Napoleon Dynamite nonetheless manages to be a hilarious comedy in its own right. Featuring a unique brand of alienated-teenage humor, the film relies more on its well-timed pauses and character body language than on zinging one-liners. If you enjoy its subtle humor, then Napoleon Dynamite is a film you'll find utterly hilarious. Otherwise, it might cause boredom or outright confusion. The film has a near non-existent storyline, but what it lacks in plot, it makes up for with its witty and hilarious comedy sequences...Jon Heder plays the title role of Napoleon Dynamite, an estranged and nerdy high school youth living with his grandmother and older brother, Kip (Aaron Ruell), in Preston, Idaho. Sporting a clueless, unchanging facial expression throughout the movie, Napoleon simply glides through life, getting kicked around, pushed into lockers, and watching life pass by. When a Spanish student named Pedro (Efren Ramirez) moves into town, Napoleon befriends the social outcast. The two drone on and on about myriad subjects, such as who to take to the upcoming dance. Fellow socially-challenged student Deb (Tina Majorino) becomes the object of their affections.Meanwhile, Kip trolls the Internet chat rooms in search of women, and Napoleon's Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in with the boys while their grandmother is away. Uncle Rico's own exploits add to the hilarity of a film with little in the way of substance, at least until Pedro decides to run for class president against the school's most popular girl, Summer (Haylie Duff). Now, Napoleon and Pedro must work against all odds to win the school election...The true strength of Napoleon Dynamite is its clan of outrageous characters, characters that are so outrageously ridiculous that every viewer can point out the mirror image of that character from his own high school yearbook or current life experience. The arrested social development of Napoleon and his friends are amplified for effect within the film's context, drawing the viewer into a Lord of the Flies world of Darwinian adolescence. The humor is sometimes subtle, and Napoleon Dynamite is not to be confused with an Academy Award winning drama. But if you like stupid movies such Dumb And Dumber, then this is the film for you.Napoleon Dynamite is a unique comedy which pushes the boundaries of plot-challenged, immature filmmaking. In short, you'll love it. Most of the characters are so pathetic, you'll find yourself laughing at them simply because they exist. One of the biggest surprises of 2004, Napoleon Dynamite is an oddball comedy that definitely ranks as a must-see movie...The DVD Report	4.0	Strange, unorthodox, but highly entertaining...	2005-04-20	6	5	1

I read reviews in magaznes like Entertainment Weekly which said this movie wasn't really that good. They said it was dry and boring. So, i pretty much just ignored it. Then, a bunch of my firends saw it and were telling me how funny it was. At first i just argued with them, saying that it really wasn't that good, but i really had no basis to do so. I eventually gave in and when it came out on DVD, i rented it. It was only about 90 minutes, it would be that bad....Well i put it in my DVD player and sat there and i watched the whole thing. I laughed, i didn't fall on the floor laughing, but i did luagh, becuase it was funny. But about 45 minutes into it and it started to lose me. It just got boring. There was never really any plot established. There was that thing about the election, but nothing was ever developed. The ending came around, and Pedro wins the election, but i didn't seem to care. It was like the writer just tried to squeeze all this stuff into the last 45 minutes and it just became painful to watch, but i did finish it.There is one reason people love this and one reason only, and i'm not saying i don't fall into this category. Napoleon is a nerd, and as you probably now, nerds are not the most popular people in shcool. htey get picked on by the ""jocks"" and when those ""jocks"" watch this movie, they laugh at the Napoleon because they feel superior to him, they think they're better. As a matter of fact, anybody who isn't a nerd (or who tries to deny the fact and never accept it) feels the same way. It's the same reason that these people pick on nerds and laugh at them. I'll admit that i am one of these people and do in fact pick on the nerds, so i'm not going to lie to you. Now, the nerds see Napoleon and can realte to him and laugh at him that way, becuase they feel like they share his experinces.As i said, i did laugh, and i have repaeted SOME of the lines, becuase they were kind of funny. But, it just wasn't a good movie. If you could just look past the Napoleon and Kip and whoever else for just a second and look at the actual movie, you'll realize there is nothing there. The movie is just an excuse to put a bunch of nerds on screen make people laugh at them, not to make a movie. So, if you can accept that this really isn't a movie, you'll enjoy yourself, and i don't mean that as an insult. But, if you're like me, and you watch a movie in hopes that there is something there and that the movie is treated like the art form it really is, you won't make it through the whole movie, you might fall asleep.If you're looking for some good comedies in 2004, check out ""Shaun of the Dead"" or, despite negative critic reviews, ""I Heart Huckabees"". Also, if you're looking for a mindless comedy that is still extremly funny, and does have some kind of story going on, check out, ""Team America:World Police"". It is a perfect example that is funny the whole way through, has some kind of plot, and has some kind of intelligence.""Napoleon Dynamite"" is decent for what it is, but that's about all, it has nothing more."	3.0	What every one thinks but doesn't want to say...	2005-03-29	11	3	8

This feature length version felt so heavily forced and the gags n setups so mean-spirited, I think my one true-felt moment of ironic laughter was seeing the MTV Films logo float by. (Wha??? MTV would bankroll something as aesthetically, culturally, morally, bankrupt as this film? Gasp!) No, audience sympathy isn't asked for till far into the picture, but Anti-hero comedy this aint. The film is marketed as and initially presents itself as a ""Hooray for the Underdog"" or ""High-5 for Geek Culture"" flick, but within the first 10 minutes, this pretense is shed and all we're left with is a chance to point and chuckle, and many chances to hope that, in our youth, at our worst, we were still so much cooler that that guy. Now, even by MTV standards, that's some pretty cheap comedy."	1.0	Living In Oblivion	2005-01-11	21	6	15
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ADES8B01WRPI3	"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!"""	"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is an extremely original story idea that accidentally ended up being a work of comedic genius! Who would have ever thought of making a movie hero out of the biggest loser in your high school? That's what this film does, and it succeeds with great enthusiasm and sweet moves. Awesome!For a comedy, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE has MANY hilarious moments!Anybody who has gone through High School in the USA will quickly be able to identify and recognize the character types portrayed in this film.This film takes place in a small mid-western town that time forgot somewhere in the last 25 years. The citizens all have values and references about things from the 1980s, with things from the year 2005 appearing once in awhile.It is hard to tell whether or not the filmmakers are making fun of retarded people? Napoleon, his best friend Pedro, and their mutual friend Deb form a strange triangle of friendship and dating for dummies. But these dummies are loveable and endearing. By the end of the movie, the audience is cheering them on to succeed and beat the insurmountable societal odds against them.Napoleon is the movie's hero, and he saves the day, so if they are mocking retarded people, they at least give them much more dignity, respect and character development in this film than retarded people usually get in a real life High School.Everybody is pretty much a half-wit in this movie. What is funny is that they will explain their latest plan of action, (something so dumb and simple-minded that any ""normal"" person would immediately see that the plan is doomed to fail), but then somehow the plan will end up working itself out, after all, in a funny way.All the main characters are hopeless, helpless losers, but they somehow manage to work out something doable by sticking together and staying loyal--they got each other's backs.There is something innocent, naive and desperate in Napoleon's daily plight that we can all relate to, so we all end up rooting for Napoleon. He wants all these great things out of life, but feels practically helpless to be able to attain anything--which is where we all have been at some point in our own lives.NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is as funny as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, but Napoleon has more repeat viewing appeal, and much more incredible, memorable, quotable dialogue.This film reminds me of a more wholesome version of the real life documentary CRUMB, about the underground comic book artist R. Crumb. The CRUMB documentary shows what it's like for nerds of this caliber in real life, but CRUMB shows the dark side of life, where the Crumb family ended up--drugs, pornography, obscenity, mental illness. NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is the family friendly version of a nerd's life story.The first few times you watch NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, you will be laughing out loud with your friends, but after the shock and surprise has faded out of the gags, you will still end up watching the film, because it seems like you're hanging out with the gang--Napoleon's gang. They are good company, after all."	5.0	AWESOME Work of Accidental Cinema GENIUS! Heartfelt & Inspiring! SWEET!	2005-07-07	2	1	1

Especially those who have a hard time viewing anything that is not mainstream comedy (""Meet The Parents"" variety of humor) and is most certainly not for those who are a bit ... sensitive to movies that may have a pinch of racial comedy. I have also found that this movie will generally disturb those who were part of the ""In"" crowd in High School or College because it pretty much puts a nail in their superficial coffin.

I thought there was nothing new - nothing fresh - no surprises left.  Until I saw Napolean Dynamite.  There is nothing like it!  It held my interest from start to finish and left me wanting to know what happens, or doesn't happen, to him next.  What a great character - he's so UN cool - he's cool!  Ya gotta love'm - and if ya gotta love Napolean - well then......I watched this movie with my two sons - ages 12 and 7.  I love any movie that shows the importance of getting to know someone and then of accepting ideosyncrasies. The importance of having good friends and helping them when they need it.  The importance of not taking yourself too seriously and of following your heart, of not putting too much importance on what others think of you.....and the list goes on!This is a GREAT movie.

I don't want to get too much into the synopsis since it's probably covered in the Amazon Editorial Review, but I can say that Napoleon Dynamite is a film that everyone from 16 to 60 can relate to because we all go through at some point in our life what this main character goes through.

Animals are treated cruelly in a gratuitous attempt to make humor out of nothing amusing.When I think of yucky films that work anyway, ones amused and entertained me, I think of John Waters' ""Pink Flamingoes"" & ""Female Troubles"" and Pedro Almadovar's ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" & ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down.""

I was under the impression that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was pretty deadpan, so I was really looking forward to watching it. What a disappointment.The opening scene was promising (when Napoleon drags an action figure along the road and answers a young student's inquiries with almost aggressive bravado), but the rest of the movie is repetitive if not depressing. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the same joke told over and over again: Napoleon is not ""cool."" His behavior is bizarre. He is totally unaware ... Etc. Etc. Etc.For some reason, viewers everywhere have rallied behind Napoleon. It strikes me as odd, considering that he has absolutely no personality (oddities do not equal personality), no emotions, no depth. I think that this film is much more mindless and mainstream than its admirers would like to think.I am not suggesting that you *don't* watch this movie.  Obviously, a lot of people love it.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A38BU9SLS82TGT	Celeste M. Harmer	So far I've read that ND is a male version of WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and in many respects, that's true. The major differences are that the main character in WTTD knows she's a dork, knows the other kids ridicule her for it, yet feels powerless to stop it and just unempowered in general.Not so with ND.  Although Napoleon is a dork among dorks, he's oblivious to it all. His apathy with life in general serves as a protective shield, and if he feels victimizes, he doesn't let it get him down and doesn't show it.  In a strange way, he has a lot of self confidence, because in his eyes, he's okay, and that's what matters.The story moves against a backdrop of gorgeous Idaho landscapes.  Who knew there was more to Idaho than just potatoes?Here's the story: Napoleon is an apathetic nerd whose life is inhabited by a daredevil, dune-bike-riding grandma and a cybergeek brother named Kip.  The Dynamite parents are both conspicuosly absent.  Grandma and Kip treat him with a good deal of indifference and apathy.  Even Pedro, the gentle-natured Mexican boy he befriends, is indifferent to a degree.  Then one day Grandma injures herself while riding her dune bike, and Uncle Rico, a washed-up football player yearing for his glory days, commandeers the house.  Undoubtedly he's come to stay so that he can take advantage of Grandma's absence in order to give himself a break from living in his early 80's behemoth orange housevan.  Between eating all the red meat in the house and selling dubious goods door to door with Kip, Uncle Rico makes Napoleon live in complete mortification by screwing up his dating life and just embarrassing him in general.It gets better when Pedro decides to run for class president, but I'll let you watch and see!  The humor is so deadpan in ND that at times you may forget to laugh.  If you rewatch it, you'll see all the funny parts you missed the first time and laugh out loud!	5.0	Flippin' Awesome!	2005-03-23	1	1	0

I won't say I was a Napoleon in school, but the situations, and the characters, should be familiar to anyone who went to a small town high school.  While it does not have a plot in a normal literary sense, it very definitely has a meaning.  It is a humorous, subtle, revenge of the nerds.  Everyone who was not a jock or cool dude in High School can probably relate and enjoy.For those people who are confused about the setting of the movie -- it is in the current time, probably 2004 (in the opening credits the HS ID card is labeled 2004-2005).  This is ""small town"", and in Idaho, where, like Utah, trends take 10 years to show up from the West or East coast.  The everage student at Preston High in the movie looks like they are from the current age -- Napoleon, who seems to shop at the local ""DI"" (Deseret Industries -- Idaho, Utah, NV, Arizona thrift store chain), like many people in small towns who don't have lots of funds, probably do -- looks like the 80s some of the time because of his economic ""class"" which leads to his choice of stores to shop at (see above).All the ""Flip"", ""Fetch"", ""Sweet"" and such words bring a smile to anyone who has lived in Idaho or Utah.  There is a ""local"" feel but excepting some of the Idaho/Utah culture that sometimes shines through, this could have been set in Indiana or Nebraska or Iowa or anywhere else with small rural towns.I thought it was great.  My brother back in New Hampshire thought it was funny, but probably would have given it 3 stars. My wife, who is from Japan, left after the first 30 minutes -- she doesn't have the cultural background to relate at all...The last scene of the movie, with the dodgeball, brought it all to a touching conclusion for me.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3H6PPWWDIC8KX	Charles Burns	"I think Clarissa Garcia's review was spot-on.While everybody has a different sense of humor, I simply do not understand how this movie is considered ""funny."" Most of the characters appear bored in their roles, reciting their apathetic lines in emotionless monotone. This can be funny if done well, but only when well-written. If just about any conversation in the movie were removed, it wouldn't significantly effect the (alleged) flow of the movie.An example of a conversation (paraphrased since I don't recall the exact lines--they weren't very memorable).:Napoleon to Pedro: What will you do when you ask her out.Pedro: I don't know, maybe make her a cake or something.Napoleon: Oh, okay.In general, the rest of the dialogue is similar--eventless and mostly pointless. Some movies are intentionally funny (American Pie and similar pure comedy movies), some are not meant to be funny but end up being so due to clever writers, and some try to be funny and fail miserably due to mindless stupidity (Big Mama's House, Undercover Brother). Napoleon Dynamite is none of those--it doesn't seem to try to be funny and doesn't succeed in being funny--it just existsWhile nobody watches this kind of movie expecting a deep plot or insightful dialog, most people at least expect more than a string of unrelated events that have no tie-in due to the lack of some measure of plot, point, or reason for existance. This film seems to me little more than a documentary on a few weeks of the lives of a few boring people. I'd compare it to Blair Witch in some ways, mostly in the ""waste of time"" department.I recommend renting or borrowing it before buying because it is definitely a ""like it or hate it"" movie."	1.0	The popularity of this movie is a mystery to me.	2005-01-31	23	9	14

Or anywhere else for that matter.It feels as though the makers of the film sat there thinking ""what would be funny to see in a movie?"" and then took an hour thinking of a list of things.Writer A:""oh man! trapper keepers! remember those? hahaha""Writer B:""yeah! what about moon boots!""Writer A:""what about a guy on a bike, pulling a guy on rollerblades! hahaha! that'd be hilarious!""Writer B:""yeah but how do we write that into the movie??""Writer A:""we don't! we'll just have it happen!""The movie plays out like a pile of ""funny"" ideas thrown together into an uneven, aimless waste of 90 minutes.The movie does have one good quality though.It's a good Litmus Test to determine if your friends are really worth caring about.Here is one of example:Mark: Hey Kevin, did you see Napolean Dynamite?Kevin: I sure did!

As weeks passed, moments from the film started creeping into my consciousness. Sure the one-liners were memorable, but I started to remember whole scenes...and actually laughing about it. Ironically, I began remembering NAPOLEON DYNAMITE more fondly than when I originally saw it. So I decided to view it again. It was as if I were watching it with completely different eyes. The film is basically a slice-of-life story about an awkward high school kid named Napoleon Dynamite and how he deals with life's little triumphs and defeats. Practically all the major characters...Napoleon's friends Deb and Pedro, his brother Kip and his uncle Rico have their quirks but none quite as colorful as Napoleon himself (so brilliantly played by Jon Heder).But while Napoleon can be characterized as nerdy, he lives so blissfully in his own world that it's hard to feel too sorry for him. Some viewers don't like him at all. They think he's too prickly or unsympathetic. But I like him very much. Napoleon (like Deb and Pedro) is a bit of an outsider and it's possible that's because of his personality, or perhaps his personality was born out of being CONSIDERED different...a sort of defense mechanism developed over time. Or maybe, I'm just reading too much into his character.There's no mistaking the fact that Napoleon, Deb and Pedro are outsiders. During the school dance, there's a moment in which the three characters are in the foreground watching everybody else on the dance floor. At first the shot seems trivial. But after another viewing, the moment really seemed to illustrate their isolation from everyone else. I could very well have been one of them. It was oddly touching.Yet this movie is no downer. After all, the characters don't ultimately fail at all. By staying true to their originality and always being themselves, they have their victorious moments. And the more invested you are in the characters, the more pleasing their victories become. My problem when first viewing this film is that I was expecting the laughs, as you would a normal comedy. But this comedy is anything but normal. As I viewed it the 2nd and 3rd times with a different perspective, it became much more humorous, touching and satisfying. I've seen the loser-becomes-a-winner story done before but never quite like this. There's nothing apologetic or sentimental about NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, which makes it all the more charming. When the ""Promise"" song starts to play during that last tether-ball scene, I actually get a little choked-up. I don't know why, and it's probably best not to analyze...let's just say I love this film!I'm not going to advise people to watch the film again if they absolutely hated it the first time. But if someday out of nowhere you think of a moment from this film and it makes you smile, I say give NAPOLEON DYNAMITE another try!"	5.0	Watch without expectations!	2006-02-16	6	4	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2UBFC3U1ZU7C8	Charles Ryder	"Watching ND is like watching eggs fry on a hot Idaho pavement in mid-summer:It's not something you see every day but when you see it actually happening it's hard to take your eyes off it and you find it somehow amazing. This is exactly how I felt watching this quarky masterpiece. Don't look for a plot or deeper meanings in ND. This film is about its characters, dialog and production/set design.I think reviewers are wrong to think of Napoleon as a typical nerd; his nerdness is to such an extreme that it kind of comes full circle and puts him in the cool part of the meter (i.e. something so cold it feels hot). Witness the Jamiroquai dance scene at the end of the film: the students finally see the ""cool kid"" in Napoleon that was just waiting for an opportunity to show he was a guy with skills (personally, I think his dance moves are much better than anything anyone could ever do with nunchucks or a bow staff!)Pedro is admittedly walking through life on half a pulse, but the friendship between him and ND reveals there is much more to his lifeless exterior. And Uncle Rico and the assorted other characters are just brilliant paint on this colorful canvass of life, love and tater tots."	5.0	This movie is so flippin good, gosh!	2005-07-26	5	3	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3BW5LVEZS8XMJ	Chewner	Napolean Dynamite is by far the best movie of 2004. It's creativty and uniqness is unmatched by anything else coming out of the mediocre Hollywood comedy industry. The best thing about Napolean for me, is the characters. Each has thier own completly out there personality but the funny thing is, you know people that remind you of the characters. Some say there was no plot but that is another theme of the story. These people are so boring they have no plot lines in their existence. The PG rating is also very appealing to me. I love Office Space, Clerks, and movies like that but they all have unnecasary moments. Napolean replaces curse words with stupid irrelevant words but that also adds to the humor. I saw this movie with my girlfriend and we have been quoting it ever since. If you hav not see the film, I suggest you see it as soon as possible. Buy it if possible because I assure you, you will be wanting to watch it over and over.	5.0	Napolean is dynamite	2004-12-01	10	9	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AJSVKWQF6ZZ6O	chode	The movie while having many strongpoints lost its appeal the minute someone told me about it. Though I do fancy films that have little or no points, and bear irrelevant characteristics to other films, I feel like my time has been wasted. I had the distinct pleasure of going over to a frinds house and having some leisure party time when the clan of visitors in the apartment desided to pop in Napolean Dynamite. My gut instinct was to give it a chance to maybe have a chance of liking it. Nay, it didnt happen. It seems that this movie is more or less mellancholy trying to be funny. The acting is good (pariculary napoleans g'd out brother and push-over uncle) but its so dull. Perhaps the only funny part is when naploean dances for his school to elect pedro but otherwise it falls flat on its face. I can understand how some people could connect with this flick but  it's certainly not forme.	1.0	Overhyped, and fortunate to receive one star	2005-01-26	18	4	14

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3HGYY213FLZ2Z	Chris Eberlein	Deadpan comedies often become underground cult favorites, panned by most critics but loved by most audiences, and this is true with the deadest of all deadpan-ers Napoleon Dynamite.  An Idahoan myself, I left the theater mixed between utter embarrassment at my state and humorous at how stupid but charming ND ended up being.  Starring child star Tina Majorino in the role of Deb, the quiet keep-to-herself girl that befriends Napoleon and eventually becomes his secret flame, and Hilary Duff's sister Haylie, Napoleon Dynamite has a plot that is as scant as Britney Spears' wardrobe, but nonetheless it remains an entertaining piece of fluff.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A32EDSKLEUZ3Y7	Chris	Send out to Maria Devries. I had a lot of friends in High School and I think this movie is excellent. Napolean is just a supernerdy kid who says stuff that I have tried to add to my repetoire. Like Idiot in a real slow self hate manor. Napolean lives with his grandma and ver weird brother Kip who is like 30 and goes on internet sites all day. Kip wants to get into Karate and wants to start. Then later Napleon becomes friends with Pedro and Deb. Pedro and Deb are nerds to but Deb knows she is nerdy. The popular kids at the high school are kind of nerdy two. Everyone is really stupid but smart. Later on Napoleans uncle moves in after there grandma had a accident. He was a football god and wants a time machine to back to 82. Then his Uncle and Brother sell stuff and make very little money and even sell stuff for breast enhancements. Napolean gets crushed at the prom after the girl leaves. Then his brother falls in love with a Foxy sista from Detroit. And at the end they get married. It was a great movie. I watched it 3 times	5.0	Great Classic movie from 2004	2005-05-13	5	2	3
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1QRDL1BRWYF4C	Chris Phillips	This movie really should have just been one of those short movies you see at film fests which are twenty to thirty minutes long.

Gosh!).  However, after forty-five minutes or so the movie just seemed to drag.  Like others that have written reviews, I profess to liking offbeat, otherwise dull character driven movies.  Nevertheless, I watched the last part of the movie while unloading the dryer.  Note-If you too do this make sure not to miss the final dance scene.  That is worth checking out.	2.0	Should have been shorter	2005-08-15	6	3	3

Didn't I sit next to these people at lunch during my high school years? I do recall wearing a ponytail on one side of my head, and I certainly was never 'in style'. I never made a big effort to be 'popular' and certainly succeeded at fading into the woodwork, so I suppose you could say I identified with the movie in a big way.These memorable characters made being a geek great and I love them for it. It has a surprise ending, so make sure you don't turn it off during what you think is the 'last scene'.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3BOUPGDLG7QPP	"Christian Hunter ""Christian Hunter"""	"I avoided Napoleon Dynamite in theatres, put off by reviews such as Roger Ebert's.  When I finally did give it audience, it was in some hotel suite in LA, a soft robe, a few chuckles, then room service came, my girl came out of the shower, Napoleon went off, and I made a hazy mental note to give it a fair shot at some point.So, to speed things up a bit...the second time I thought it was very funny, the third time, funnier (and I don't mean just in retrospect, I laughed harder, and enjoyed it more).I've seen Napoleon like 20 times...eeezy!  It's going down in my regime of cult films with the likes of Office Space.  And, much like Office Space, it's no epic; there aren't any deep moral lessons to be had, any detailed historical accounting that will firm up your academic understanding of our place in the world.  Nope, just a concentrated dose of nostalgic hilarity.  Not in the sense that I wish I could be in High School again, or back in the 80's (a period that this film spoofs heavily), but more in the sense that it reminds you of simpler times and simpler concerns.  Nerd or not, most every reader cared deeply about the opinions of others then, about who they'd take to the dance, about whether they'd have to do ""all"" their chores (like feeding ham to their pet llama Tina).  I think if this movie - which is so oft accused of being devoid of plot - were to be forced to offer up some kind of lesson, or value, it should be just that:  it helps take our constellation of todays problems a bit less seriously by reminding us of how trivial yesterdays problems were.Plus it's got some sweet scenes!I'm sorry, but even if some disagree with my premise regarding this films value, how could anyone not find this movie flippin hilarious.  Napoleon Dynamite is NOT slapstick, it's infinitely less obvious.  That fact makes it harder for most to find the film immediately hilarious, but after a viewing or two, when your brain has ample time to digest the enormous volume of absurdity and texture, I think a good number of those who panned this film would be turned around.  This movie is an amalgamation of the High School experience, consolidated into various archetypes, then amplified to an extreme.Flippin awesome!If you don't agree with me, you should eat a decroded piece of crap!Enjoy,Christian HunterSanta Barbara, CaliforniaBTW:  Anyone who wants a Time Machine so they can go back to '82 should consult with me personally.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A95SF04RX9G8	"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com"""	Napoleon Dynamite is a hilarious movie. However, it has some key flaws - one-note characters and hardly any semblance of a plot - that take away from the film's enjoyability. It's a great setup for a movie, but all throughout, I found myself waiting for something better to happen.The film stars Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite, an intensely weird high school kid who is an outcast in every aspect of his life. He enjoys drawing imaginary animals, like unicorns and ligers, and basically hates everything else. He wants a girlfriend, but who would go out with him? He lives with his grandmother and his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), who spends his days at home on internet chat rooms with his long-distance girlfriend.When Grandma Dynamite (Sandy Martin) goes down for the count after a dune buggy accident, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in to take care of the boys. Rico is about the only fully developed character in the movie, a man trying to get back to 1982 and change the way his life has turned out. Of course, his plan for turning his life around involves selling Tupperware door-to-door and buying a time machine on eBay.At school, Napoleon's buddy Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is running for class president against the most popular girl in school, Summer (Haylie Duff), while also swooping in and taking Deb (Tina Majorino) right out from underneath Napoleon's limp grasp.I liked this movie. I really did. There were a lot of hysterical parts, but unfortunately, those parts don't add up to a complete whole. The quirky characters were dying for better situations in which to apply their quirks, but all of the plot devices were gathered from stock. If you're looking for a good laugh, I will recommend this movie, but if you're looking for a good comedy, you'll find better entries out there.	2.0	More fun to quote than watch	2005-03-07	10	5	5

The people that do not like this movie are those are RELATE TO NAPOLEON as being a nerd. Perhaps this great film triggers innermost memories of thier personal dorky childhood and it hurts them. The other people who dont like it are just boring and uptight souls anyways. And the third group that doesnt appreciate this film are the types of people that just like to go against the crowd to get attention. You and I know at least one person like that.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AYIHCL78ZPZWI	C. J. Linna	Napoleon Dynamite is a corky yet offbeat and hilarious film that follows an Idahoan nerd around in his simpleton lifestyle.  It is especially recommended for people who like movies such as Dumb and Dumber, Office Space and other movies that include quite dry humor.  Napoleon lives in Preston, Idaho where he attends Junior High and is especially interested in mythical drawings and ninja moves.  His 32 year old brother Kip, still lives at the home and finds love online while aspiring to be a cagefighter.  His Uncle Rico is a suave businessman with a money hungry attitude, and also can't stop thinking about his 1982 football game which he is convinced he would have won and continues to relive his memories over and over again.  Napoleon becomes friends with Pedro-who also runs for class president against the popular Summer.  Deb is a stuck in the 80's do-it-at-home kind of gal who also becomes good friends with Napoleon.  This is probably, if not my favorite, one of the best movies ever made!!!  Being an Idahoan, I don't find it offensive at all.  It is somewhat true, although exaggerated.  So if you're still sitting there wondering if you should pick up this movie, just do it!!!  If you really don't think you'll like it, rent it first, but I definately recommend it.	5.0	Napoleon Rocks Idaho's world!!!	2005-01-04	3	1	2

Up to this point I've heard a lot about Napoleon Dynamite, but I never believed the rumors to be true up till now. Let's just say you could not enjoy it if you were not already committed to a high school. This is definitely not a family movie. And, I would caution anyone that is dry humored to stay away from this one. You can not really appreciate it unless you or someone you know could relate to it. It is off the wall funny. Each scene gives you a taste for what to expect next. But, I think the opening line, of the movie, says it all! This is not the first time I've seen this and it probably won't be the last.

It's definitely funnier than most mainstream comedies -- particularly the scenes involving the Time Machine, the horse and the schoolbus, and the portraits on the wall in the living room -- but it chafes me and before you slam the non-helpful button, consider this:1) The movie owes a lot to the spirit and style of Wes Anderson, right down to the precious opening credits, but it's not nearly as funny as ""Bottle Rocket,"" as unique as ""Rushmore"" or as moving as ""Tenenbaums.""2) This is basically a quirky commercial stretched to 90 minutes.3) Would anybody really like to spend time with Napoleon if they knew him in real life?  He's mean, unlikeable and his interests all seemed to be designed by writers into kitsch and irony.4) Having most of the characters act like they're on serious meds or retarded doesn't make them endearing, it makes them seem self-conscious.

My problem with this movie is that I felt like I wasted my time watching it when I could have done something way more interesting.  Maybe I just don't get it or can't empathize with the characters, I thought the little romance was cute and the grandma was cool, but overall I think I just found the main character to be really dumb.  sorry to all you guys who really liked it, maybe you're better than me too.	1.0	glad it wasn't my money	2005-01-31	20	8	12

Many times I've rented a movie simply because it was named by certain people has the best movie of the year or one of them. Yet I watch it thinking when's this genius supposed to come through?Napoleon Dynamite(his real name apparently) is one of those nerds that you can't really imagine other nerds thinking he's cool. He talks in a very deadpan way, has a bizarre family and has curious habits such as eating potato tots he stuffs in his pockets.The main plot from what I can tell is one of his friends(should I say one of his only friends) is running for class president which isn't even introduced until a good halfway or so in. So Napoleon wants to get him to win only they have to compete with Summer, one of those so popular for doing nothing girls that are in high school hallways.Then there's his bizarre brother(?) who spends a lot of time chatting to his woman on the internet. There's also his uncle who has some weird money making idea all the time and is one of those relatives that embarasses you just by being themselves.The acting isn't all that bad. I actually liked 2 of the girls: Deb who plays Napoleon's sort-of love interest and Summer, played by Haylie ""I'm Hilary's sister"" Duff. As for our main guy? Well if it was his job to sound bored he certainly nailed it. His eyes tend to be slightly closed half the time and he speaks in a drawling voice even when he's mad. And it sounds like he overacts to certain scenes, especially when there's something that upsets him.I can't explain it.

I think that is really what the point was.  Jon Heder played Napoleon Dynamite just right.  Napoleon is one of those nerdy guys that you went to school with that just didn't know how to connect with anyone.  He came from a really strange family that includes his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) who thinks that he should have been given a better chance in playing football in high school and his 32 year old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) who liked to spend all of his time in chat rooms on-line.When we first see Napoleon he is a total loner with no one to talk to, play with, or hang out with.  He hooked up with Pedro (Efren Ramirez) on Pedro's first day of school when the principal asked him to show Pedro where to find his locker.  Teaming up with Pedro gave Napoleon someone to identify with and talk to, although neither one did much talking.  He helped Pedro with running for class president.  Some of the funny parts are due to Pedro's running for president and how they managed to help each other out with some of their ""skills.""Pedro and Napoleon help each other out when it comes to courting the ladies.  Neither Napoleon nor Pedro knows the best way to go about it and both fall flat.  Both guys like gals that are way out of their league, but that doesn't stop them from trying.  Things take a little turn when Pedro ends up with Deb (Tina Majorino) as a date to the prom.  It doesn't take long for the viewer to figure out that Napoleon and Deb are interested in each other.  In the mean time Napoleon's Uncle Rico and brother Kip are busy with lives of their own.  All of them fall into situations that should keep you laughing.The best thing about this movie is that it is something that the whole family can watch.  You don't need to worry about language or nudity.  I could easily watch this movie again."	5.0	Nerd or Teenager finding life?	2005-03-21	3	3	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A25ZVI6RH1KA5L	"cookieman108 ""cookieman108"""	"In high school, I was one of the nameless, faceless rabble who drew little attention, maintained a low profile, and caused little trouble all in the hopes of getting out relatively unscathed, a goal I managed to accomplish, partly due to my sometimes intimidating presence, but mainly because I was able to fit in, sort of like a fish within a shoal...but there were those who weren't so fortunate, as obvious physical characteristics or personality traits (or both) tended to enunciate their presence regardless of vain attempts to `blend in' or enjoy the anonymity I, and those like me, tended to take for granted.  Napoleon Dynamite (2004) is a film about one of those individuals.The film, written and directed by Jared Hess, takes place in a small Idaho town and stars Jon Heder as the title character (he reminded me a lot of Timothy Busfield's character of Arnold Poindexter in the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds).  Also appearing is Jon Gries (Real Genius, Fright Night Part II), Aaron Ruell, Efren Ramirez (Kazaam), Tina Majorino (she played the little girl with the map on her back in Kevin Costner's flopperino Waterworld), and Haylie Duff, sister to the more famous Hillary Duff, who both share a surname that's the same as Homer Simpson's favorite alcoholic beverage, Duff Beer.Napoleon Dynamite is an odd character for sure, with his shaggy red afro, moon boots (he wears them year `round), and t-shirts usually featuring those glossy iron-ons so popular in the 70's (he seems to purchase much of his wardrobe at the local thrift store) with a penchant for drawing mythical creatures, boasting about fictional girlfriends who live in other states (don't they always?), and touting his non-existent martial arts abilities, ""You know, there's like a b*tt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join because I'm pretty good with a bowstaff"".  Oh yeah, he breathes mostly through his mouth, and his vernacular includes, but isn't limited to, the liberal usage of such words like sweet, flippin', gosh, freakin', and heck, and he, along with his 32 year old brother Kip (Ruell), live with their grandmother, who owns a llama named Tina.  After an ATV accident sends grandma to the hospital, Uncle Rico (Gries) arrives to watch over the boys, and involves Kip in his schemes to make some sweet cash.  Napoleon, meanwhile, finds a friend in a newly arrived Hispanic student named Pedro (Ramirez) and he and their shy and kinda dorky friend Deb (Majorino) assist Pedro in his bid to become the next student body president, their competition being Summer (Duff), member of the cheerleading squad and the most popular girl in school.  Do the trio have a chance in beating the juggernaut that is Summer?  Perhaps, but it requires Napoleon to pull forth from within something no one would have realized he had, not even himself...The film is very odd...it's kind of a mix of the Coen brothers (Fargo, Raising Arizona), John Waters (Crybaby), and the earlier films of John Hughes (Sixteen Candles).  There's not much of a story at the beginning, more of a series of innocuous, unrelated, comical events, but later on we do see some development in this area with regards to Napoleon and Deb helping Pedro in his running for student body president.  Some scenes will make little or no sense in relation to what you may perceive as the story, so my recommendation is to just let it go, and enjoy the film for what it is, whatever it is...the real fun lies within Heder and his complete submersion into the character of Napoleon, wallowing in his own uncoolness.  Initially most will probably find him annoying and off-putting, but he sort of grew on me, and I actually found myself quietly rooting for him, in his most simple of endeavors (like trying to find a sweet fanny pack at the local thrift store), but don't get the wrong impression.  This isn't a triumphant nerd film (the nerd beats the jocks and/or gets the head cheerleader in the end), but a character-driven slice of weirdness that has a tendency to amuse.  The dialogue contains tons of quotable lines, and comes across genuine sense of realism.  The composed music by John Swihart and chosen pre-recorded material used to make the soundtrack complemented the film very well.  I think my favorite scene is when Napoleon discovers his uncle's crude time machine (which he purchased of the internet), and decides to give it a try...does it work?  Well, it does something, but I won't tell you what...one thing I really noticed was an absolute absence of profanity.  I'm not against its' usage in films, and have even become used to it (for better or worse), so it was kinda refreshing.The picture quality, presented in both 1.85:1 anamorphic wide screen and 1.33:1 full screen (both sides of the DVD are used), looks sharp and clear, with the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio coming through very well.  Special features are numerous and include a commentary track by the director/writer Hess, actor Heder, and producer Jeremy Coon, along with deleted scenes (with optional commentary), a short film entitled `Peluca' (basically the original concept for the character of Napoleon Dynamite, also with commentary), a number of MTV promotional spots, a still gallery, a featurette on the shooting of the final scene (keep watching the film after the credits to see a newly filmed 4 minute sequence shot a year after the film was released, made especially for the DVD release), and a promo for the FOX television series Arrested Development.  The special features are split between the two sides of the discs, so be sure to flip it over once you've finished one side.  My recommendation is to rent the film before buying, as it's not for everyone (I wouldn't bother showing it to my mother, as I know she wouldn't attempt to understand the where the humor comes from within this film).Cookieman108"	4.0	"""I caught you a delicious bass."""	2004-12-30	127	115	12

And anyone old enough to get it probably won't see it.  You might as well show Two Lane Blacktop to people who came to see Two Fast, Two Furious.Still, with a bit of judicious editing, N.D. could have been tailored to the right audience.  Napoleon comes home and, tired of being picked on, heads for dad's gun cabinet.Locked 'n loaded, its back to school for some serious detention.  Before going down in a hail of bullets Napoleon whacks most of the football team, narrowly missing a cheerleader in a low cut, tight-fitting top and a teacher, in a low cut, tight-fitting top.Soundtrack by Fear Factory; direction by Oliver Stone (who lays down some nonsense about it being a serious commentary on the state of American society).  This could be HUGE.Then again, I found it pretty funny just the way it is.	4.0	Better than My Mother The Car!	2005-07-08	5	3	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	Jared Hess's cult classic from 2004, Napoleon Dynamite, immediately drew me back to such films as Rushmore, Election, and Welcome To The Dollhouse- films that deal with high school life in comic ways. Yet, of those films, Napoleon Dynamite is probably the most off the wall. The film is set in director Hess's hometown of Preston, Idaho, in the southeastern corner of the state, not far from the Great Salt Lake. It is not a parody, but an absurdist tale, as none of the characters are in the least bit realistic. Napoleon Dynamite is the lead character's name (and yes, it sounds like the name of a loser from a bad punk rock band), and he is played by newcomer Jon Heder- a tall, red afro'd, four-eyed geek who is a not too good liar. He lives with his grandmother (Sandy Martin) and websurfing, geeky older brother Kipling (Aaron Ruell), until grandma wipes out in an ATV accident on sand dunes. Then, their uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with the boys. Rico is a bad Tupperware salesman who lives out of his aging van, and still wishes it was 1982, when he was a backup high school quarterback. He feels his coach's decision not to put him into the game denied him a shot at the NFL. Napoleon's school life is not much better. He's bullied by kids his age and younger, and makes only two friends- a Mexican kid named Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez), who's as passionless as his name is generic, but who has a sweet bicycle, can work up the courage to talk to girls, and has an real mustache, and a cute, but weird brunet girl named Deb (Tina Majorino), who attempts to run her own door-to-door Glamour Shots business.... The film is well written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, and there is a making of featurette not for the film, but the addendum wedding after the credits. This seems wholly in keeping with the film. There is also a commentary with Hess and Heder, but little of note is said, save for the fact that we learn Heder is married in real life, and Majorino (Deb) is a hip hop dance instructor. The film, however, tells much more than other films with seemingly similar subjects because it does not try. What it shows, though, is really, really funny.	3.0	Funny	2008-09-15	1	0	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"If you like dry or dark humor, you should get a big kick out of this movie. I know I did. If you are between 12-20 you might even like it more because this deals with high school kids primarily. However, there are some adults in here who play key roles, too.The teens and the adults have a couple of things in common: they are nerds and weird people and they are ALL hilarious. They also are unlike a cast of characters you have seen in any other movie. In other words, this movie is an ""original.""I didn't know any of these actors and I think that helped. It made it even more original, looking at new faces. That begins with the title character, played by Jon Heder. A white kid in Idaho with a afro haircut, over-sized glasses, moon boots and an unpredictable and low-key personality unlike anyone I've ever seen in other films. Even though he's pictured as a huge nerd, he surprises you all the time. Just when you think you have this kid figured out, he does something unexpected. Whatever, he's fun to watch and hear throughout the movie.Suffice to say ""Napoleon"" and about everyone in this film is totally whacked and all of them - male, female, young, old, good and bad people are extremely entertaining. A lot of the humor is visual, meaning the looks and reactions on these character's faces and the weird deadpan lines they deliver. Are there stereotypes in here? Yes, like the bimbo, prettiest girl in school running for class president , and her stupid, macho boyfriend, but most of the people were pretty unique.If you like absurd humor, this is your cup of tea, and you don't have to be a teen to enjoy this.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"Everyone comments on how strange this movie is.  However, my son and nephew assure me that this movie is not an exaggeration of how certain characters actually live.  After viewing this strange flick in more or less bewilderment, I thought about it.  I have come to believe that the strangeness of the flick is less the focus on some nerds than its treatment of them.  The movie doesn't make them the object of ridicule or irony.  And that is what is strange.  Whenever you see characters like these on the screen they are the butt of jokes, made ridiculous, or destroyed.Look, Napoleon and his family and friends are some of the weirdest people you will ever see on screen and maybe in real life as well.  You will find yourself mystified by their approach to their problems.  They seem to either not understand the way out of their situation or they lack the energy to get out.  Maybe it is both.  What you will love them for is that they do not knuckle under or accept the badge of loser that the ""cool"" kids want to impose on them.  My favorite scene involves Napoleon asking one of the bullies for one of Summer's campaign buttons and then heaving it down the hall.  Glory!Pedro is another great character.  Strange and great.  I mean, how could the desire to run for class president and the need to cut off one's hair because it is making you too hot reside in the same individual?The ending of the movie has more poetry in it than you might catch on first viewing.  Remember Pedro's campaign promise and then look closely at everything that happens as the movie ties things up.I recommend seeing this movie.  Just don't expect seeing anything like you have ever seen on screen before.  And if you find yourself rejecting the images at first, I encourage you to stick with it.  I think you will get it by the end.  Younger folks seem to get it easily.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2WSAGFJSQC1YF	Crease in the Page	It's about time someone came up with a movie that accurately portrays nerds with all their quirks and qualities.  Who is the first person to sincerely greet a new student?  A nerd.  Who will risk his last scrap of dignity to defend his friend's honor?  A nerd.  And who, other than a nerd, can possibly have a life that, without forced plots and fancy filming, is interesting enough to sell?Napoleon Dynamite makes us laugh because the producers very accurately capture an underappreciated subculture--the subculture that is at best disregarded and at worst supressed daily in American high schools.  Nerds.  They have an excessive fixation with all things medieval and fantastic.  They combine fashions from different decades in one mismatched ensemble.  They retain their passion for youthful entertainment.  I don't think we're laughing at Napoleon Dynamite in mockery, rather we laugh because we recognize in him someone we know who we're appreciating for the first time.True there's not much plot in this movie.  But there are only so many plot lines in the world, and we've seen them all, so who cares?  The tone of the production is lighthearted, not cynical; it captures every aspect of nerdiness, without prompting us to scorn the characters.  And what sets Napoleon Dynamite apart from all other movies is the lack of sex, violence, and foul language.  It's a good, guilt-free laugh.	5.0	It's about time!	2005-01-26	8	8	0

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1TCXOUZMAAH9V	Critic of the Beat	The other night I was at a friend's house. We were bored, so we decided to rent a movie. At the movie store, we spotted Napoleon Dynamite, the movie that people were calling 'Hilarious'......We rented it and went back to my friend's house to watch it.This was by FAR the worst movie I have ever seen. What is it that people see in this movie?I'm not going to tell people not to see it. Why? Because my friend was laughing his heart out.....and it's usually very tough to make that particular friend of mine laugh. So I suggest you see it.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1Y67BEMZMU7SD	"Cromulus ""Magnus Cromulus"""	"Clearly, Roger Ebert has joined the clown because he completely misses the point of Napoleon Dynamite in particular and the building blocks of comedies in general.To accuse Napoleon Dynamite of relying on the audience's predilection for feeling superior to the characters is akin to accusing Shakespeare of creating characters in his comedies to whom we feel superior to.  That's partly how comedies, especially satires, tend to work, Roger.  Besides, in the case of Napoleon Dynamite that's not even the whole story.Napoleon Dynamite's success is not contingent on whether or not you feel superior to any of its characters.  Its success lies in the way it manages to strike a dissonant chord with people who feel as though they don't belong anywhere and feel alienated.That is the point of the lama, you see?  It's a markedly alien being in a markedly alien environment.  The same thing holds true for the chicken farm where Napoleon is seen trying to stick two chickens inside a cage where they don't belong.  The same thing holds true for Pedro who is a Mexican stuck in a strange land.  The same holds true for Uncle Rico who is stuck in the early 80's and in a past he never even had and the same is true of Kip, who's been chatting with chicks online (a virtual world) the whole day, dreams of being a cage fighter (while possessing a less than intimidating physique and molasses like reflexes) and  eventually finds his way home by becoming ""black"" and heading to the city.  The same thing holds true of the bodybuilder Starla, who looks as much at home in the Midwest scenery as the lama does and the same thing holds true of Napoleon's 1970's disco suit and the liger.  And I could go on and on and on.Napoleon Dynamite is obviously a movie about alienation and for my money, it is every bit as great as ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", a movie that is all about recognition and admission."	5.0	A work of staggering genius.

The problem with many of today's movies is that they think they need to have sex jokes and cuss words to be funny. This movie shows that you can be funny just being stupid. I am 20 years old and I am immature. I laughed at this movie until I cried. This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.Aside from the side splitting laughter, this movie also has it's tender moments.

That includes all of Wes Anderson's movies. Except Anderson's comedies are goofy. This movie is really polarizing in nature. You either love it or hate it.Ebert hated it. He claims it to be depressing. In a way, he's right. If one were to view this movie as a drama of a urban small town still stuck in '82, well, we got one of those Sundance indie flick right now.This movie transcends beyond the conventions of any cliches you find in modern cinema. The characters, close ups or medium, are simply placed right smack in the middle. There is a sense of symmetry going on here. Relationships between characters are kept within a minimal physical contact. The dialouge is absolutely inane, insipid and mundane. But let's face it, in a sleepy town like this, what sort of small talk would you expect?Napoleon Dynamite represents the epitome of an ultimate high school geek still stuck in fourth grade. Still obsessed with doodling pictures of mythical beasts (not very well drawn IMHO), feeling all icky about going out with girls, standing by like minded friends through thick and thin.Eventually, what won me over and had me re-evaluating this movie again was this single line near the end of the movie, before the ""grandslam finale"" on stage, whereby Pedro was about to lose all hope of winning the School President election. Napoleon asked him to go for it, ""Just follow your heart, that's what I do."" Such simple lines, but yet it validates all of Napoleon's actions throughout the movie. He has been telling everyone that he has been doing things he feels like doing but like the rest of the world, they ""hear"" you but no one's ""listening""."	4.0	As subtle as a chainsaw	2005-01-14	4	2	2

Remember what few lines of dialogue he uttered, but how his insanity made the movie? Remember the paper-thin plot, and how some scenes (shooting the horse?!) didn't make all that much sense? Here's your Animal House for the new century--Napoleon Dynamite.Perhaps you have to have grown up with a certain type of ""boy"" (a stupid-acting brother, a joking dad, an annoying next door neighbor kid) in your household to really get the humor in this movie...and it helps to have grown up in a small rural town like Preston where absolutely NOTHING happens for months on end.  This is Napoleon's life, and while his life isn't as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be (where DID these people grow up? obviously, somewhere more exciting than I did), it's certainly one filled with everyday annoyances: dumb older brother still living at home, weird uncle, sexually suspect grandma, and an arrogant llama. He escapes via his imagination: he draws unreal animals and visualizes himself as a numchuck-swingin' stud.The performances make this movie, as its plot is the visual equivalent of a to-do list. Jon Heder's brilliance as Napoleon, the nerd in search of imaginative life, complements perfectly  the rest of the cast's offbeat, but  very real, performances of everyday people doing everyday things.Only someone  young could make this--Jared Hess is 24-- but I've met several middle-aged folks who said it was priceless, and one of the funniest films they've ever seen.I think ""Animal House"" and ""Napoleon D."" are the only two movies I could watch over and over again, and still laugh every time.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1TFN8HZIXFX97	Cynthia Sorgenfrei	The plot of Napoleon Dynamite is all about friendship and courage. It's about being a square peg, yet fitting in. It's about liking yourself no matter what anyone else thinks of you. It's a movie that says sometimes people who tell tall tales can be endearing. It's a story about talent and the courage to let it shine. It's a story about success in the face of failure through the belief in one's self.

I personally think the movie was great.  It's definately a unique film.  How often do you get to see a curly-headed dweeb yell at his grandma's llama and throw food at her?  I think it basically just depends on the type of person you are as to whether or not you'd like the movie.  Maybe you haven't noticed, but all the people who give the movie 1 star tend to criticize other people's reviews for missing commas, misspelled words and other crap like that.  One person said his crap told him better stories if that tells you anything. They also seem to think that a nerd is the same thing as a retard (and aren't afraid to rag on people who are mentally handicapped), and they use the two terms retard and nerd interchangably.  The majority of these people seem to be incredibly uptight.  They are right about one thing though... this movie has next to no plot.  The personality, or lackthereof, of the characters makes up for it though.  This movie isn't one that provokes deep, meaningful thoughts.  It's just a light, simple comedy.  People should lighten up and take it as such.  Go ahead and try it though, you'll love it...or maybe not.	5.0	You'll either love it or hate it	2005-07-31	4	4	0

I have seen it a couple more times now; I think it is going to become a cult classic.  Genuis is the best way to describe the writing and directing in this film.  Simple and funny are two words that describe the story.  But there are a few more words that can be included: daring, brilliant, and creative.Napoleon Dynamite creators, Jared Hess and his wife, manage to offer a story touching on so many real-life high school and rural living situations that hit close-to-home for most people.  Some my find the situations almost too close to home.  I found the entire film to be enjoyable entertainment.Napoleon is definitley a nerd.  But he is a nerd searching for a way to make his life a little better; he is trying to stand up to his ""looney"" grandmother (at least I think that's who she was), deal with his strangely-geekier-than-Napoleon-himself brother Kip, and fight off the bullies who attack him day after day.  He makes friends with another loner named Pedro, a guy who appears addicted to downers, thought I don't think that's included in the storyline.Napoleon's uncle Rico ends up coming to visit, and this adds more difficult times for poor Napoleon.  I think each of these characters, including Pedro's and Napoleon's love interests in the movie, interact so well together that the story almost seems like it is a documentary - a bit of an exaggerated documentary though.It is really cool to watch Napoleon deal with so many situations, which aren't really earth-shattering events, but he treats them as they are.  He handles problems Napoleon's way, and that gives this film a unique freshness that grows on the viewer.This is a movie that has to be watched more than once to completely grasp its creative juices.  I think John Heder plays this role so well that it may be hard for him to ever be himself again.  Many people will always call him Napoleon from now on.  I would love to see a part two and part three.  Heck, what about a weekly television show!  Napoleon may be one of the most memorable characters to come out of a film since Silence of the Lambs' ""Hannibel the Cannibal"".Like I said earlier, I didn't ""get"" this film upon a first look, but after another viewing I really think this independent film is going to LAUNCH the career of Jared Hess to a new level.If you haven't seen Napoleon Dynamite, I suggest you give it a try.  If the first time you watch it, it seems a little ""off"", give it one more try.  I think it such a different kind of movie that it is hard to ""take it all in"" upon the first viewing.I am glad to have this little gem on my DVD shelf.See ya next review."	5.0	A Movie That Needs More Than One Look	2005-02-26	5	4	1

As a light-hearted comedy it follows the travails of the frustrated, gangly, unseemly, and misanthropic high schooler, Napoleon, along with his circle of similarly weirdo and disenfranchised characters that surround him--his brother Kip who specializes in chat rooms, Pedro the improbable class president, Uncle Rio a door-to-door salesman, and his heart throb Deb. Napoleon is hazed at school, envies Pedro's mustache, lies about having a gorgeous girl friend, and musters his best compliment to Deb at the dance: ""I like your sleeves; they're big."" These central characters are all decidedly uncool. But everyone needs a friend, and at times watching this film makes you squirm when you appreciate the very real social realities that it parodies.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4	Daniel Hurley	"This is actually a great movie to watch with your young teens. This C movie, C because it has a budget cheaper than a B movie, is almost a twisted version of ""Leave it to Beaver"" without the hominess of the 1950's nuclear family. The Dynamite family is a fractured group of relatives living in the wide-open spaces of Idaho surrounded by farms. The High School and community seem to be in a time warp since the ""hip kids"" in school actually look relatively like squares particularly the designated good looking guy antagonist who looks like he is sporting popular fashions from the mid 60's and he looks like Eddie Haskell (Leave it to Beaver) if Eddie had worked out (Son of Eddie?). Napoleon is handicapped by a family without parents that are never mentioned, he lives with his 32 year old unemployed computer nerd brother, his tough often absent grandmother, a sleazy visiting uncle who still wishes it was 1982 and he was a HS quarterback, all made worse by their poor economic situation. In addition, Napoleon has a tall-uncoordinated body, ill-fitting clothes, a bad haircut, an often-scrunched leer of a face and he possesses severely limited social skills. He is hopelessly antagonistic towards the in crowd, who he tries to combat by using over way over the top sarcasm. Although aware of his limitations, he naively strikes forward in attempts at dating and political school relationships. The movie is full of stilted dialogue that is sometimes painful (""you gonna eat your tots?)but fitting with the characters. The movie meshes surprisingly well with Napoleon and his friends Pedro, who runs for School President, and Deb, the nerd princess who pleasantly turn into an attractive young girl, surprisingly making headway although fighting extreme odds. Somehow this low budget flick got Hillary Duff's sister to play the antagonist sweet girl. A unique feature of the film is the periodic cameo like appearances of Pedro's cool and hip and slightly dangerous looking older cousins in a real ""boss car"" with great sounds. The cousins seemed to have transcended from our time into this Idaho time warp making their brief appearances startling but effective. On first take as an adult, you may reject this movie, but watching it with your kids you are more likely to pick up on this ultimate stark underdog movie that is extraordinarily unique.  Keep your expectations low, this isn't a Ron Howard production, and you will be surprised."	4.0	Low Budget C Movie Shines: Nerd in Idaho Thrives	2004-12-23	9	8	1

The humor is simple and subtle, which to me is where this movie's charm is, but the humor is definately there if you're into this sort of thing.  And if you're like me, tired of all the over-the-top plot lines, so-called humor, and computer graphic imaging, this movie is a breath of fresh air (note the tacky Casio playing in the background.  Hilarious).We all have been there.  High school was uncomfortable enough, but the kids who were die hard goofballs, and they didn't even see it in themselves, were the ones that had it the roughest.  The main 3 main characters in this cute little movie were those kids we all new in high school.  The sweetness of this movie comes from how their friendship develops and where it leaves them.  If you read into it, it tells us the story of by sticking and working together, we can overcome everything. If we have hopes and dreams, they will come true. We should all be so lucky to have friends like Napolean, Pedro, and Deb.Throw in the equally goofy secondary characters, relax,and take this movie for exactly what it is, you can have a laugh riot.  This held true even for this forty-something and her husband.Finally, what I loved about this movie is that I didn't have to be afraid to watch it with my 15 and 9 year old sons.  Our 15 year old appreciated it because he's currently living it, his mom and dad appreciated it because they have lived it, and the nine year old loved it just for its pure goofiness.

This is one of those rare movies that you can laugh by just looking at a character.  John Heder plays Napoleon Dynamite to perfection and the rest of the cast is flawless.  The movie could have probably done without Sensei Rex, but whatever.  This movie isn't for people who prefer comedies to be mostly getting hit in the crotch, passing gas, and then getting hit in the crotch again.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AIYYKHP5N3YLO	"Daryl Frasch ""Daryl"""	"With the Sundance favoritism and the hype surrounding dead-pan comedy ""Napoleon Dynamite"", i could not wait to experience this piece of indie film.  To my surprise, the movie disappointed me thoroughly.  Begining slow and coming to an even slower pace, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the pitiful and longwinded story of a highschool nerd and his struggle for girls and class presidency.  Filled with random bouts of what is supposed to be comedy and cheap-shots at high school satire, this movie breathes endless monotony and undeveloped emotions.  The characters are boring and without feelings (although the acting on the mexican student character's and the photography girl's character was done quite well) and i found myself constantly being bored with Napoleon's continuous cynisism.  The script itself wanders all over the place, giving most of the interaction no purpose or consequence, so most of the scenes are pointless.  This film may be found funny by those who see themselves as better humans than Napoleon and his friends, but for the rest of us who just want to enjoy well-made, well-written indie films, this heap of trash is at the substratum of my list of horribly bad films."	1.0	Definitely Not Dynamite.	2005-02-05	24	10	14
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ANEP7R6LM206E	Dave92270	This unique movie depicts everyday lives of mostly teenage characters in the small town set in the middle of nowhere. The individuals presented to us are hopelessly handicapped by the limits of their small town's life  - however this is not a movie with deeper meaning in mind, this is movie for laughs. The characters are carefully selected and well portrayed, situations and dialogs flawlessly written without a blank spot, superfluous scenes or empty dialogs. There is not too much of a plot because nothing ever happens in here - the main events are concentrated around the teenage dating attempts, who to take to the big dance, and the class president election at the local high school.This movie offers intelligent humor in it's best; most big production releases with it's toilet type jokes can't even distantly touch what writers of Napoleon Dynamite were able to do here with minimum budget and little known cast. It appears that people who rate this movie so poorly are divided into two main groups; those who are not able to find any meaningful plot and so they condemn it, and those who seem to judge it way too quickly - and then throw it together into the same bin with Beavis & Butthead type humor - because the teenage characters and small town similarity... these two things are the only common points.This title is worth your attention and time; my wife and I watched the movie quite a few times and so far we didn't get bored - it is funny & sweet at the same time; hopefully you'll be able to find your way to like Napoleon, Pedro, Deb and others for exactly what they are, and accept their strengths and weaknesses.	5.0	Vote for Pedro!

My wife thought it was ""mean.""  I thought almost every scene was funny.  My wife was bored and kept commenting on how slow it was.  This is the magic of Napoleon Dynamite.  Either you get it or you don't.  I get it.  It has many layers of meaning.  Its deadpan delivery masks layers of emotions.  The movie happens inside of you not on the screen.  On one level or another we are all like Napoleon.  And although we are not as imobilized or socially retarded like him, we all have had our awkward moments, and our moments of triumph.  And like Napoleon, if we have his integrity, we come through it all with our PRIDE INTACT.  This is what this movie meant to me.  And besides the time machine scene made me laugh so hard it ""killed."""	5.0	Not the best movie ever but . . .	2005-04-22	8	5	3
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a social misfit from a family of social misfits, a gangly, hostile, uncomfortable high school student who often looks as if he is on the verge of falling asleep.  This film presents a few days from his life.  His visiting uncle (Jon Gries) ruins what passes for his social life, his brother (Aaron Ruell) falls in love on-line, and Napoleon champions his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) for class president.  He kind of falls in love and has a small triumph at the end.  This is a very odd film, with the entire cast delivering deadpan performances that contribute to the general weirdness.  It is often very funny, with Heder giving a truly memorable performance.	4.0	Deadpan dweebs	2006-02-04	0	0	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR	David E. Levine	I have seen a number of strange, quirky comedies and, if you can get into them, they can be good. I think that this is a great movie but, the problem is I can't figure out why. Is one of these movies that's so bad it actually beomes good in a kitchy sort of way or, is it really good? I haven't figured out the answer but, regardless, I really liked it and for those who can get into strange comedies, I highly recommend it. John Heder plays Napoleon, a totally deadpan nerd who speaks in a monotone throughout. He is a highschool student in Preston, Idaho, kind of a dreary looking place which has as much personality as does Napoleon. No matter what happens to him, no matter what bully is pushing him around, the deadpan demeanor never changes. He has an older brother at home and a strange, thrill seeking grandmother. When the grandmother ends up hospitalized, she has their uncle stay with them. Now, you have to understand that the nerdy older brother is about 32 yet, nontheless, he and Napoleon need someone to stay with them. By the way, this uncle is quite a piece of work, priding himself as a would have been professional football player who never got a break. Also, he and Napoleon's brother hook up in some offbeat money making schemes.The big brother is not the same type of character that Napoleon is but, in his own way, he is equally a nerd, as he sits at the computer chatting with his online girlfriend. When his girlfriend arrives, by bus, from a distant city, she does not appear to be his type, indeed she is quite a surprise. OK, you can see it coming so maybe it's not such a surprise. Anyway, the two get along famously which adds more comedy to the movie.There is a new kid at school, Pedro, and, with a Spanish accent, he too is as big a nerd as you can be. Lie Napoleon, he too is deadpan, barely reacting to events. However, he gets an inspiration; to run for class president. In his way, Napoleon helps him with the campaign against a snotty, blond princess named Summer. Does Napoleon ever, even briefly, break out of his deadpan? You'll have to see this movie to find out.Also, to some extent, Napoleon has a romatic interest. He tries to get a date to a dance with one of the good looking, hot girls at school and, by some wierd quirk, he actually does. But, there is a friendship with a female nerd who fits in perfectly with Napoleon and Pedro. Is this friendship a romance? Oh, I don't know. The plot isn't involved enough to really delve in to such things. However, for the right, offbeat sense of humor, who needs a plot? The peculiar, quirky characters and situations are enough.	5.0	Is it so bad that it's good?	2005-04-12	5	1	4
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3HGQ6FSVR0FF0	David E. Tate Jr.	At first, I thought the makers were having too much fun at Napoleon's expense, but as the movie went on, I was impressed with Napoleon's grumpy moxie. He is principled, and stands up for what he believes in.I do not know if it was intended, but Jon Heder does an unbelievable job of portraying a person who might have the diagnosis of  Asperger's Disorder (autistic social features, normal intelligence).Additionally, the commentary reveals Hess is basically telling stories on himself, adding to the fun of this exceedingly dry-witted gem of a film.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1BFTKKBHIR1BY	David G. Smith	I teach high school, and so many kids said that I should see this movie.  I was too busy drawing weird mythological creatures, and dragging action figures behind the bus to see it in the theatre.  So I just saw it on dvd...I have this quirk in which I tend not to want to see things people say I should see, and a lot of independant films fall short for me, but this film is the real deal.  It is quirky, it is defiant, and for the most part, it holds true to it's main character.  The thing I liked most about the movie was Napoleon and his steadfast dedication to being him.  This is a character...not a stereotype...that's the way I see it, anyway.  These are kids who are strikingly true to who they are..True, the film does lag at times, and lacks somewhat in substance, but it is headshakingly original in so many ways...It is a little like cleaned up John Waters, or linear David Lynch..My only negative is that at the end the film moves to a more traditional sort of ending....that is dissapointing.  I think that Napoleon deserved more than that.  Otherwise, the movie is amazingly original and fun.Check it out.	5.0	god!!!	2005-03-07	9	9	0

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AL2ZCI11JEROS	David	"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the kind of movie that makes some people laugh until they cry, and some people not believe they spent good money for such a boring, unfunny film. The words that come to mind are ""one man's trash is another man's treasure."" Whether you will like this film depends on how willing you are to laugh at those more unfortunate than you.The movie centers around a sleepy farming town in Idaho where Napoleon, a tall, awkward high school student who sports a a light brown 'fro, big glasses, and moonboots lives. His eyes are always squinted, almost shut completely, as if the sun is blinding him all day. He lives with his also bespectacled brother Kip and manly Grandma, though his sleazy, scheming Uncle Rico takes care of him and Kip when Grandma breaks her cocyx in an accident. He seems to have no friends until he meets Pedro, a moustached kid of Mexican descent who starts going to Napoleons high school. Along the way, he also befriends Deb, a ponytailed shy girl. Eventually, Napoleon helps Pedro try to run in the school elections, but overall the movie feels more like a series of hilarious skits with a vaugue plot than a true movie held together by strong themes. This actually works, once again, depending on if you are willing to laugh at the things Napoleon says and does, things that aren't really supposed to be funny. Most of the people who disliked this movie say it is cruel to the ""nerdy"" characters and their awkward actions that the audience laughs at. But the makers of this film are actually showing sympathy towards the characters, and much of the film is just the truth, taken from the writer's childhood experiences. If you have a broad sense of humor and see this movie with that in mind, Napoleon Dynamite may make you laugh till you can't laugh no more."	5.0	Hilarious	2004-12-23	4	4	0

Personally, I loved it, but I can easily understand that it would not appeal to large numbers of people.  If you enjoy quirky, offbeat movies like, A Mighty Wind, Best in Show, Crumb or Hairspray, I would think it likely that you'd appreciate this one.  Of the fifteen people I have introduced to my new favorite movie, only one has not liked it; the other fourteen want to watch it again and again.  Take a chance.

I made it about half-way through. The second time I was prepared, and my opinion improved. The third time I recognized the movie isn't stupid--its about the average live of an average young man in America today, which, we should face it folks, is all too often stupid and degrading. Ultimately, this film is supportive, touching, and fun. More than one viewing may be required for people like me who are mystified by what is enthusiastically endorsed in American culture. No doubt it is unwarranted, but I gave this movie a five star review because the producers and director did not back off.	5.0	A Hidden Pleasure	2013-09-02	2	2	0

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ	David M. Lovin	"But only because the character, Napoleon, is one we can all remember from our high school days.  I was definitely not in the popular crowd in high school, I just kind of existed.  But I remember kids taking beatings and abuse all the time for just being themselves.  Napoleon is just such a character.  His hair looks like he hasn't brushed it in years, he openly breathes through his mouth annoyingly, he stores the cafeteria's tater tots in a fanny pack to eat later in class, he has terrible glasses and answers every question seemingly with a mini tantrum, as if it was the stupidest question he had ever heard.  This attitude, along with his appearance, make him a complete loser in school.There isn't much of a storyline, just Napoleon's interactions during the film with some weird characters.  His brother is a chat room addict, his uncle can't stop thinking of 1982, when he was a high school jock and just missed on his big chance, he has a new friend at the school, a mexican student named Pedro, who is just as quiet and withdrawn as he is.  Eventually Pedro will decide to run for class president and Napoleon will help him.  This brings about the only semblance of a climax to the film, but otherwise, it is just Napoleon and ""the lovely state of Idaho"" on display here.This is not a bad film.  It is not great, at least not to me.  I teach in a high school now and saw the movie basically because my class talked about it all the time.  I can't say that I know any Napoleons at the high school I teach at, but he's probably there, calling everybody an idiot and going outside to feed his grandmother's llama.  I just haven't noticed him yet."	3.0	Painful to watch,	2005-05-21	6	2	4

If you go into this movie with an open mind you will enjoy it.  The bland corniness of the characters, the strange poignancy, the directionless storyline, and every other aspect of the movie somehow blend together to create a lighthearted and funny microcosm of adolescence and the high-school years.  I don't think there is any underlying meaning or societal commentary.  It is almost like a small-scale version of Forrest Gump -- it speaks to the value of true friendship, but other than that, is merely a snapshot of a period of someone's life.	5.0	That's What I'm Talking About	2006-02-24	4	4	0

John Heder in his first performance in a leading role, or really any role period ... shows that he knows exactly what he is doing and should be looked at as one of the new elite comical actors.The no budget film ""Napolean Dynamite"", honestly doesnt really even have much of a point to it, and if it does than it can pretty much be summed up in three words ... ""VOTE FOR PEDRO"". If you want to watch a comedy that stars an actor like Adam Sandler and has a big budget, than you will most likely be dissapointed because this movie is not meant to be like that ... at all. A low budget movie is a completely different kind of film altogether, A low budget comedy has to have it's laughs 99% from dialouge usually a subtle type of comedy. Napolean Dynamite's Dialouge is outragously sad yet completely comical. The people, plot and setting are all very different but all well thought out and purposely pitiful.After seeing this film I was hoping for many more of it's kind. In June the Director of this film released his second film ""Nacho Libre"", though it had pretty good numbers in the box office, overall the film tried to be like ""Dynamite"" and pretty much ... failed. Though it had a few laughs the movie was not very good.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A205RTIMJZ3732	"Devin Kuberski ""Psychedelic Leviathan"""	"The first time I saw this movie I hated it because it lacks well an over-arching plot. It seemed like it was just a bunch of slack jawed vacant eyed losers standing around for an hour and a half. However something within me said to go back and watch it again, simply because everyone had said it was so brilliant. I rarely listen to anybody on matters of taste but I decided to re-watch it because the movie was already sinking it's tentacles into me.It became better and better with every watching. I don't know how it does it...but that's the effect it has. All I know is I swore I'd never watch it again and now I own it.What this movie really is is an atlas of the lost types of people that exist in dullsville towns like Preston Idaho. It captures the ennui of these places and takes you into the mind of a weird dude who is a non conformist in a cornfed place where this is in new way a good thing. All of the people in this movie are lost, even with those who are supposed to be cool had a somewhat desperate and pathetic feeling to them. You know that as bad as they can be they'll wind up stuck in this village for life living off their faded glory like Uncle Rico. But then it was easy for me to feel that way living out West. Summer Wheatly may rule Preston high but she would be just another person at the school dance here in California. See the cartoon 'Totally Spies' for any further information on the types of uber preps we have in this place.It's also a great freakshow. Napoleon with his tot obessions and bo staff skills, Kip and his internet stalking, Pedro and the holy chip scene that never got put in but should have and above all...REX KWON DO.A great 'loser' movie. Like if Beavis and Butthead were brought to life and then somehow made into even bigger outcasts than before. But I can't give it 5 stars because it like it's setting seems lethargic. You will root for Napoleon and Pedro but the popular crowd (aside from that bullying skinhead thug Randy) seems more dumb than evil.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	If someone had told me an independent film about a geeky nerd--a film sporting a cast of characters who sit around with the most vacuous, blank expressions imaginable, and whose dialogue consists primarily of monosyllabic words--would become a cultural phenomenon. . .I would be asking that person if I could have what he or she is drinking.  Yet such is indeed the case with the extremely strange NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE, a movie so. . .different. . .it's still creating a buzz, as evidenced by the 1400 reviews here (and counting).Napolean (Jon Heder).  Pedro (Efren Ramirez).  Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Uncle Rico (Jon Gries).  Gentlemen, I salute you.  You have taken your respective characters to the realm of bizzarro (and beyond).  And after my initial shock, after several subsequent viewings, I have thoroughly enjoyed your performances:  Kip's unique method of locomotion; Uncle Rico's love of steak and of videotaping his throwing motion; Pedro's blank gaping; Napolean's ultimate dancing performance.  All of the above now ensconced in film legend; all of the above just plain darn fun to watch.It's often lame and ridiculous, and sometimes Heder's nerdiness becomes so irritating it's tempting to send the remote through the flat screen, but director Jared Hess knew what he was doing when he crafted this supremely unique film.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered far into the future. By some, at least, to whom this movie will sit comfortably alongside similar ""cult"" type movies. Others-most, I'd suspect-will watch it and wonder what all the fuss is about. And so, you must ask yourself: what group do you most likely fall into? Are you into the cult-type films? Or more mainstream than that? Your answer to that question probably answers how you'll feel about this movie.The main problem with the movie, it seems to me, is that it isn't really about anything in particular, plot-wise. Rather, it's a collection of character sketches, loosely tied together by a plot that feels tacked-on because the writer realized that he needed a plot of some sort. Whether Napoleon's friend Pedro does, or does not, win his election (which provides the climax to the movie), is almost completely irrelevant to the film as a whole. Except for the cool `Vote for Pedro' shirts that some people wear now, the election could have been totally removed from the film and I expect that it would seem basically the same. It could also be said that ""Napoleon finding someone to connect with"" is also what the film is about, but really, it's not. That may or may not happen over the course of the film, but Napoleon's character is, himself, so lukewarm about his relationships that it can't really provide a focus.As a collection of character sketches, the movie is hit or miss. A lot of the characters are very broadly drawn and seem cartoonish. The tone of the film, itself, is not cartoony or slapstick or absurd-it seems to want to portray reality in some way. And so the characters and the film appear to clash at times, providing an interesting if slightly disturbing experience.And so: why will this film achieve cult status, and why is it so popular? Because the main character sketch-Napoleon Dynamite, himself-is brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed. Otherwise, this is not particularly a great film, per se. The story is inconsequential, it teaches little to nothing, the writing is average, the direction forgettable, the acting passable to silly, etc. But what it does do is it creates an Icon. Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered because the eponymous character will be remembered. Napoleon Dynamite is a nerd protagonist, but (and strikingly different from the norm) he is not a hero. He really isn't even likable, and is kind of a jerk. Vastly different from, say, the Tri-Lambda house, who were nerds out of a sense of self and integrity and ""being who they are,"" Napoleon is the way he is either out of a philosophical myopia or, because strangely, he's trying to be cool. He's kind of like an arrogant jock character in that he looks down on most people; they differ because 1) no one agrees with Napoleon's sense of the cool and 2) jocks are strong enough to enforce their ideas and Napoleon isn't. Of course, underneath his (ineffectual, funny) bluster, we can see that (just like most of the arrogant jocks) he suffers from low-self esteem and looks for others approval to validate him. That's why he lies about things like ""hunting for wolverines."" In short, Napoleon isn't a movie-nerd, heroic and decent, just misunderstood; he's a real-nerd, struggling and sometimes self-loathing with a patina of false-pride. We have, all of us, known a Napoleon Dynamite at one point or another in our lives, and we've always wondered: why? This movie doesn't ever really answer that question, but it does show us enough reality that we have some evidence upon which to guess. And that's pretty cool."	3.0	Not a Great Movie, but an Iconic Character	2005-05-12	5	2	3

I kept hearing on the local radio station; Rent  ""Napoleon Dynamite!""  The disc jockeys would reference some saying from the film like, Gosh!  I felt like I was missing out on a rip-roaring movie. The disc jockeys said it was destine to be a cult classic. So, I had to rent it.I found out, Napoleon Dynamite (John Heder) is actually a person. Napoleon's appearance is right out of the 80's. I thought this movie was set in the early 1980's. But when Napoleon said Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) is stuck in 1982 the setting had to be present day. There are so many quotable phrases like gosh and freakin' idiot that they might become part of normal conversation.Napoleon is a high school geek. He is no longer affected by any cut down remarks or being picked on by his schoolmates. He reciprocates with his own gestures and comments. Other characters include Napoleon's love interest Deb (Tina Majorino), his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and school friend Pedro. (Efren Ramirez) Are they all geeks or unique in their own way? But all of these characters are relatable to everyone now or from the past. That is why this movie is so interesting. It gets the viewer thinking! You might have to view the movie a couple of times to catch all of the comedic, quotable dialogue.The movie takes place in the Director's (Jared Hess) old hometown of Preston, Idaho.

NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE brings to the big screen the experiences and misadventures of the epitome of misfit-dom--the title character (a curly-headed, coke-bottle glasses-adorned outcast played by Jon Heder).  This guy is really like no one I have ever seen.Napolean  is a young man who lives with his grandmother and 32 year old brother in a small town in Idaho.  His days consist of feeding their llama, seeking out odd jobs (they include working in a chicken farm, hearding the creatures into cages and analyzing glasses of milk to determine what the cows consumed before they were milked), and just trying to survive the ups and downs (mostly downs) of high school life.  Napolean encounters fellow geek Pedro (Efren Ramirez), recently uprooted from his native Mexico, and helps him run for class president.  Napolean also encounters Deb (Tina Majorino), a shy aspiring glamor shot photographer, who becomes his friend.This film is filled with a kind of humor best-described as ""off the wall"" and ""subtle"" (to say the least).  In fact, when I started watching it, I really wasn't sure if it was really going to appeal to my tastes (though, I try to keep an open mind and enjoy independent films).

He befriends a Mexican moron with high hopes, and lucky for him, Napoleon just so happened to have rehearsed a few dance moves with a workout video, which got him the student body president title - I'm not sure I want to know what hypothetically became of that situation.The definition of nerd may be that of a person who is socially awkward, but usually highly intelligent and achieves great success in life in the corporate field, science field, or computer technology; while the 'jocks' who picked on them in high school become some sort of blue-collar simpletons working under them. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this character.  I Am surprised that Napoleon does not attend one of those ""special needs"" schools, and it is difficult to surmise what would become of him after graduation - or perhaps his older siblings are a sad indication..."	1.0	He needs a drool bib	2006-03-26	20	7	13
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ADELVNWVJAPGO	Dragonbrain	"No offence to anyone who liked this movie, but it has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life and I've got a copy of ""50 Horror Classics"" with such winners as ""Attack of the Killer Shrews.""  The characters were barely human, purposeless blobs living in a universe beyond their ability (or desire) to understand, to which they reacted based solely upon their stunted and infantile emotions in a stumbling, slack-jawed, nearly drooling manner.  It was Beavis and Butthead without the innuendo, a Quentin Tarantino movie without the violence, Southpark without the violence or bad language.This is the kind of movie that most directors think they need to add sex or violence to in order to make it interesting (which, of course, for any thinking person, doesn't ever work).  Indeed, the only two marginally funny parts in the movie are a reversion to this concept (though quite greatly toned down): the cow shooting/school bus childrens' reaction and the pi&ntilde;ata.The popularity of this movie convinces me that I am, indeed, abnormal."	1.0	The Joke Is On You for Buying It!

The movie is surrounded by idiocy and is nothing more. The problem with ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is it's characters are too over-the-top in the geek department which makes it useless in my opinion. You can't sympathize with these characters because they aren't realistic like many people say you can with these characters. So you're left with characters stumbling  through school acting like morons and nothing else. If you're into it then you'll love it and if you're not then oh well.

Let's list all the reasons it stank with bullet points, since that would be just as lazy as the film itself.1. There's no plot.2. There are no characters, only people with ""hilarious"" quirks.3. The guy playing Napoleon is about ten years older than your average high school student.4. Napoleon is a geek and a loser.5. No really, I mean it.  If I saw him walking down the street, I'd beat him with my boot.  He's not a charming nerd.  He's a moron who walks around with his eyes barely open.  I wanted to run him over with my Accord.6. Oh yeah, the acting was miserable.  But i can excuse that, since the script was apparently written on the back of a cocktail napkin.7. Bringing up numchuks is not a joke.  Putting your main character in an ugly suit is not a joke.  You see, a joke actually has to have a thought behind it.  People who like this movie also think Donal Logue is hilarious on the I Love the 80's.I hated this movie.  If you're over the age of 12 and you still have your frontal lobe, avoid it.

Napoleon is the ""class geek"" that all of us remember from high school.  So far so good, but the film simply didn't do anything for me.  In a word, I found it lame.I literally nearly fell asleep during this movie - it was that dull for me.  By about 1/4 way through it I could not wait for it to end.  I stuck it out as I kept expecting it to get better and become funny.  It never did.The only part of the movie I liked was the WHEN IN ROME song they played during the closing credits.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	I laugh a little bit harder every time I sit down with this one, but can acknowledge that other viewers' enjoyment will depend entirely upon their own experiences in high school. As a proud survivor of the awkward, unpopular farm town geek club myself, though, there's a lot of familiar territory covered between the credits of this little sensation. The film itself is a conundrum; an MTV production that feels like a DIY indie picture, it successfully captures the best elements of each without getting snagged by any of the drawbacks. Napoleon and friends come off as just awkward enough to feel authentic in their small town school, while the studio's big city influence delivers a surprisingly appropriate, not-quite-star-studded soundtrack. It's at once sweet, funny, genuine and flamboyant, with a story arc that always gives me the warm fuzzies.

Yet there is much to like in these characters, even with all of their flaws.This movie speaks a lot of truth. I have known people in my life who resembled the people in the film.

I sat through the whole thing and rarely laughed out loud. I just kept thinking, ""Why am I watching this"". Now some people (like my wife) would stand up and find something better to do, but once I start a movie I really like to finish it. Even when it was over I was still thinking, ""Why did I watch that?""Then about a week later it happened. I couldn't help but laugh as scenes from the show started returning to my mind.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3VTWN2JH8UNV8	Dustin Perry	"The summer movie season is gone and with it came the usual onslaught of action flicks, big-budget thrillers and even a few hilarious comedies. Matt Damon, Will Smith, Tom Cruise, Tobey Maguire and Will Ferrell all had big hits. However, in the midst of all the robots, amnesiac hit men, mustachioed newscasters and web slinging, a different kind of leading man set quite a unique landmark: Filmdom has a new reigning nerd, and his name is Napoleon Dynamite.Newcomer Jon Heder stars as the protagonist in the title role of director Jared Hess' debut film about a tall, moon boot-wearing geek with thick glasses and a curly red hairdo trying to make it through his high school days in rural Idaho. He lives with his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), an equally clueless loser who spends his days chatting with babes on the Internet, and their grandmother, a four-wheeler enthusiast played by Sandy Martin.After an accident in the sand dunes leaves granny with a broken coccyx, Napoleon and Kip's uncle Rico (Jon Gries) becomes their temporary caretaker. Uncle Rico assumes this responsibility the only way he knows how: by showing the boys boring videos of himself throwing footballs past the camera (his team almost won State in 1982) and recruiting Kip to help him sell plastic kitchenware and breast enlargement pills door-to-door.In between receiving nonstop ridicule and alienation from his classmates, Napoleon spends most of his spare time touting his nunchaku skills, drawing flatulent fantasy creatures, feeding his pet llama Tina scraps of ham, sloppily chugging cranberry juice, testing out a time machine Kip bought online (complete with power crystals) and learning ""flippin' sweet moves"" from an ancient hip-hop dance tape he finds at a thrift store.Rest assured, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" does have a plot, minimal as it may be. He befriends Mexican transfer student Pedro (Efren Ramirez) and manages his campaign to run for class president against the token popular girl Summer (played by Hillary Duff's sister, Haylie). There's even a love interest for Napoleon named Deb (Tina Majorino), a quirky girl who wears a ponytail on the side of her head and specializes in Glamour Shots photography and making cheap vinyl key chains.You'll be too busy, however, watching Heder steal every single scene he's in while at the same time, destroying all the clich&eacute;s of how characters like him are supposed to act. After all, any movie nerd can have a pocket protector and fawn over Gillian Anderson, but how many have ever stuffed tater tots in their pocket or tied fishing line to an action figure and dragged it from a moving school bus? Add to that Heder's throaty, deadpan delivery of lines like ""Are you drinking 1 percent milk because you think you're fat?"" and what you end up with is a new cinematic hero for the Star Trek-quoting, comic book-collecting masses.Hess' directorial style and dialogue have drawn comparisons to both Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse."" But his film has indie cred coming from almost every angle and just enough slapstick (including a hilarious cameo by Diedrich Bader as the instructor of his own brand of martial arts, Rex Kwon Do) to distance itself as an extremely original and entertaining movie.If you want to see this hidden gem of a movie (and I highly recommend you do) you'd better hurry because it's likely to be knocked out of theaters soon by the slew of upcoming blockbusters that, most likely, won't contain any tater tots or llamas."	5.0	Napoleon Dynamite ended the summer movie season with a bang!	2004-10-07	13	9	4

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3IPVJN2665EUK	Easy Writer	This is probably one of the best comedies to come out in recent years. It isn't your conventional comedy though. Most of the characters in the movie are extremely strange and are social outcasts. The humor is mostly deadpan instead of charasmatic and wacky. It is probably the most popular among teens even though most teens probably don't relate with Napoleon or anyone else in the movie. It's a very different kind of movie which probably helps contribute to its popularity.The movie really doesn't have a story. It's basically just about Napoleons everyday life. Napoleon Dynamite is an outcast. Most nerds usually have other nerdy friends but Napoleon doesn't even have those until a new Hispanic student named Pedro arrives. He also becomes friends with a girl named Deb. His life becomes even more miserable with the arrival of his Uncle Rico who constantly screws up things for Napoleon. He stays with Napoleon and his thirtysomething year old brother Kip while their grandma recovers from and accident at the sand dunes.Napoleon Dynamite is played by Jon Heder, who turns in one the best comedic performances of all time. He makes Napoleon depressed, nerdy and very unlikable. Hes not the kind of person you would wanna hang out with but somehow you root for him throughout the movie. There is something appealing about him thats hard to put a finger on. Hes a unique, memorable, and very quotable character that's not easy to forget.Aaron Ruell plays Napoleons even nerdier brother Kip. He's not as relaxed as Napoleon and he spends all day chating online with his internet girlfriend when hes not helping Uncle Rico sell tupperware. Efren Ramirez plays Pedro. He always has a blank look on his face and is even more out of it than Napoleon. Jon Gries plays Uncle Rico. Hes probably the most annoying character in the movie. Hes constantly looking for ways to make money and wishes he could relive his college football days. Tina Majorino plays Deb, Napoleon's potential girlfriend. She looks nerdy in the movie but is actually very cute in real life. All in all the whole cast does excellent work making the characters what they need to be for the movie to work.There is nothing really offensive in the movie to it's probably ok to let your kids see it.It's a unique movie that, like Napoleon himself, you won't soon forget.	5.0	Freakin' Awesome Movie	2006-05-31	6	4	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"A great film to compare this one against is Todd Solondz's masterful ""Welcome to the Dollhouse.""  Both are centered around a character conventionally described as a ""nerd,"" ""geek,"" ""dork,"" etc.---adolescent pariahs.  Solondz's however is a far darker vision: he treats all of his characters mercilessly, his knife cuts in all directions and the audience is left squirming and cringing the whole way through.  Hess's film while also reveling in long drawn-out awkward moments, is far more forgiving---in fact, if anything it can be faulted for sugarcoating and copping out with the humorous but implausible happy ending.  Yes there is some amount of self-consicously hip dork-worship but he doesn't overdo it, in contrast to films like ""Rushmore.""Hess treats every one of his characters gently, even as he teases them and exposes all of their flaws.  We do squirm, but not to the extent that we have to look away from the screen like with a Todd Solondz movie---there is no element of sadism present.  So the gentleness extends to the viewer too.  The whole film is full of implausible and absurd situations, but does it so consistently that it actually becomes almost believable by the end---reminds me a little of the Coen brothers' early work.I wouldn't buy it, but it was an enjoyable and light 86 minutes courtesy of netflix.com"	4.0	pleasant light comedy, VERY light...	2005-08-03	4	2	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"It appears high school hasn't changed much for social misfits since Carrie burned down the gym or even since Jan Brady didn't make the cheerleading squad. The primary goal of this breed continues to be to find acceptance among peers they have empowered to be their superiors by the will of their own self-consciousness. Napoleon Dynamite is merely the latest incarnation in this 2004 MTV-produced comedy. The movie has nice visual touches (like the food-oriented opening credits) and some funny moments, a few even inspired (the sign-language version of ""The Rose"", the chicken farm scenes). It's also admirable that director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the movie with his wife Jerusha) goes neither the smutty nor the slasher route in drawing viewer attention. However, your enjoyment of this film will depend strictly on your ability to relate to a series of episodes that play out like one of those 1950's education films on how to behave on a prom date but reset to present-day, small-town Idaho. For me, the plights of the title character and his friends Pedro and Deb just aren't interesting enough to hold my attention. Accentuating the void is the fact that they are called upon to look very stilted and speak in deadpan, monotone voices. While amusing for about five minutes, it stretches an 86-minute movie into something that feels interminably longer.Jon Heder certainly looks the part of the supreme geek outsider with his red `fro, aviator glasses and polyester prom suit. But his character is simply not fleshed out enough to root for his success, as he avoids eye contact when he talks and encourages the abuse he gets from the more popular kids. As Napoleon's new best friend from Mexico, Efren Ramirez plays Pedro, who has no qualms about asking a popular girl out or running for class president. Former big-time child actress Tina Majorino (she was the little map-tattooed girl in ""Waterworld"") portrays Deb as a painfully shy girl who fancies herself as an Annie Liebowitz-type of photographer. They're all quirky enough, but you simply pay attention to these characters because no one else will. Usually someone like Napoleon would have a successful big brother to taunt him, but instead we have 32-year old Kip played with equal deadpan style by a pale-white Aaron Ruell. Kip spends most of his free time in online chat rooms and ultimately has a fanciful romance with his cyber-girlfriend, Lafawnduh. In fact, if you wait for the ending credits to finish, they even have a pastoral wedding. While the idea is funny, the ludicrous nature of the relationship feels overly contrived. Providing more honest laughs is Jon Gries as the moronic, self-proclaimed lady-killer Uncle Rico. With his 1980's-style toupee and constantly flexing his non-existent muscles, he lives in past gridiron glories that probably never happened, even buying a mail-order time machine to transport him back. His new career selling Tupperware makes for a couple of funny scenes.In fact, there are several amusing ideas, but they don't seem to add up to anything that memorable by the poignant tetherball-swinging end. One almost longs for the return of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"". Even the climax is oddly unfulfilling as Pedro's presidential aspirations hinge on Napoleon displaying some pretty impressive dance moves to a song by Jamiroquai. The DVD includes four deleted scenes and a black-and-white short called ""Peluca"", which stars Heder and provides the basis for the movie. There is also audio commentary by the director, Heder and producer Jeremy Coon. This is the first time I encountered a DVD that uses both sides to provide the full and widescreen versions, but it also means you need to flip your disc to see all the features.

Many scenes portrayed situations so awkward that you could only sit there and cringe. The movie had a lot of style and did a great job of portraying a milleau that may be all too familiar to many.	4.0	This movie was hella good	2005-02-14	2	2	0

Those of us with sense realize that this film lacks any humor at all.  What the former type of viewer has mistaken for humor is a condescending hatred of its own characters.  People who like this film just enjoy laughing at nerds.  It's actually that simple.There's no plot.  The characters, pathetic as they begin, never develop.  The so-called jokes are so dry that one feels the sensation of dying in the desert as the writers senselessly destroy the spirits of their own characters.

Napoleaon is an uncivilized, provincial, utterly-fool, overly-abused and socially-unappreciated individual. As the movie progressed, I started to hate those behaviors and personalities, and wanted badly for Napoleon to REVOLUTIONLIZE himself quite like the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte (if not, at least, quite like his brother.) In Part Two of this movie, if there will be, I expect to see Napoleon as an energetic and pragmatic individual with his hilarious drawing, dancing and time-machine experimentations.	5.0	Idea for Part Two of Napoleon Dynamite.	2004-12-23	2	0	2

At the beginning it feels like a bunch of scenes of hilarity strung together ( Including Rex Kwon Do ) but once Napoleon meets Pedro and Uncle Rico comes, things begin to progress.Small laughs and moments make this movie funny. You may not be falling out of you chair but you will have a smile on your face during this movie from Uncle Rico throwing a steak at Napoleon's head or Kip ( Napoleon's brother ) going ""gangsta"". This movie uses its free spirited design to bring the sometimes humilty and sometimes dullness of Napoleon's life to the viewer.Overall- I guess I can see how some people would be turned away by this movie.

Most of the humor is directed at and some might argue, against, the main character Napoleon, who is depicted as a nerd to end all nerds. But, the humor isn't cruel, because the audience loves and roots for Napoleon's success. The film is absolutely loaded with one-liners that you will catch yourself running back and forth with your friends long after you see the film. As far as longevity goes, after two viewings, the humor is not as grabbing as the initial. It probably won't hold up to a film like ""The Big Lebowski"". But, it will stand the test of time to sit proudly next to your copy of ""Bottlerocket.""

No, the bottom feeders in my school were like Nappy D.  They just didn't look right.  They weren't eager to please, they were irratable & antagonistic, like Napoleon.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3H82LUT1EC655	Erika Sorocco	In the state of Idaho, nothing exciting happens to teenager Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), except for the daily beatings he endures by his fellow classmates. Which, might I add, are totally uncalled for. After all, Napoleon has an awesome 'fro, cooler than cool moon boots, a pocketful of taters, and an array of skills that can't be beat. Yet Napoleon still has to endure days filled with avoiding his cage-fighter-wannabe brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), whom spends his days chatting online with hot babes; and his slimy, scheming Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). But when Napoleon meets a new kid named Pedro (Efren Ramirez), the only kid at school with a mustache; and then runs into shy, creative Deb (Tina Majorino), the three friends put together a plan to elect Pedro for class president. But to beat spoiled, stuck-up Summer (Haylie Duff), Napoleon will have to unleash his super-secret weapon. One that no one knows about.I will admit right now that I'm not often dragged into movies with such oddball characters as the one found in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. But there was something about the trailers that got me interested in this one. Luckily, I ended up enjoying this movie more than I could have ever imagined. Jon Heder is a fabulous actor, who is sure to make his mark as a comedian after his performance as Napoleon. His two strange friends, Tina Majorino (ANDRE and CORRINA, CORRINA) and Efren Ramirez (RACE and KAZAAM) couldn't be better as the two oddball sidekicks who show up whenever they are needed, to express strange comments about various situations. Haylie Duff's (IN SEARCH OF SANTA) performance was quite good as the at-times vicious, popular girl, Summer. While Napoleon's unfortunate family members, Aaron Ruell and Jon Gries (REAL GENIUS and JACKPOT) are absolutely hilarious. Ruell's performance as the annoying older brother is right on target; while Gries' role as the scheming Uncle stuck in 1982, couldn't be funnier. I rarely say this, but NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is sure to go down in cult-classic history, as are it's many quirky stars.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper	5.0	Napoleon Dynamite Is Just That...Dynamite!	2005-01-05	14	8	6

(No Spoilers Included)The open-ended one sentence summary: A stupid nerd who lives in Idaho deals with his weird everyday life.Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Some mild bad language, some bullying, and couple light innuendos.Characters: 3 of 5 stars. This movie was not a marvel of acting, and I wouldn't go so far as to call the characters loveable, but they were all very memorable. You'll probably just laugh and/or think they're stupid.Plot: 2.5 of 5 stars. No plot whatsoever. Just everyday escapades and quoteable lines in Napoleon Dynamite's life. It managed to keep my attention, though. I even asked ""Why are we interested in this?"" as we were watching, then continued being interested.Cinematography: 5 of 5 stars. The high rating is due to the excellent scenery/props/locations. The movie is set in a run-down, rural Idaho, and is complete with 70's shag carpets, ketchup stains, unmown lawns, and quiet flea-market type stores.Music: 4 of 5 stars. Perfect for the movie. It's that same kind of retro-tacky instrumental music that goes so well with the retro-tacky surroundings.Impact: 4 of 5 stars. It's a flippin' cult hit, what do ya think?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2BVXINN1GXR3I	"Evan Ozimek-Maier ""screenwriter/film reviewer"""	"In a remarkable display of brilliantly-evil marketing, MTV has made ""Napoleon Dynamite"" out to be the breakout comedy of the year.  Of course, can a film really be considered a ""cult film"" if it calls itself a ""cult film"" first?  That's kind of like giving yourself a nickname - you just don't do it.But the brainwashing plan seems to have paid off (just look at how many 5-star reviews this movie has been given).  People LOVE this movie.  Since its release, the movie has received more overzealous support than I have ever seen.  If fans aren't quoting it, they are urging their friends to go see it.But I am not one to knock cult support.  The problem with ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is that it hasn't done anything to deserve said support.  You might ask, 'where does ""Napoleon Dynamite"" fail where other, similar films shine?'  Let's review.First up: sympathetic characters.  For any film to be considered great (or even good, by my standards), you must have at least one character with whom the audience can/will sympathize.  Unfortunately, the film's titular character lacks on all levels as a character.  When he isn't standing still, devoid of any normal human emotions, Napoleon proves himself to be quite a pompous jerk (perhaps proof that his name may not be a coinsidence).  The same can be said of the movie's supporting cast.  Without any zeal (or the acting skills to fake it), Napoleon's posse of social outcasts lead static lives against their static backdrops.Secondly, self-proclaimed ""comedies"" have to be funny.  The problem with ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is that the audience is left unsure of what to laugh at.  Needless to say, Jared and Jerusha Hess won't be winning the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  The best way to think of the movie's inane script is to imagine a series of half-realized one-liners begging to be quoted a million times over.  Had the Hess's focused on writing meaningful dialogue, rather than finding a way to stretch a 2-minute joke into an hour and a half, the movie's laughs could have come much easier and much more frequently.Finally, plot is usually something writers strive for in their work.  One of the biggest problems with Napoleon Dynamite (beyond the two mentioned above) is its complete lack of plot.  What can best be described as purely static (both in direction and in narrative), the movie makes no attempts to develop (or even create) a plot that it can follow.  Napoleon and his band of misfits never change or develop (except for Napoleon's brother, who makes a mildly amusing change towards the end of the movie), and we are given the impression that things will never deviate.Had the filmmakers worked to make ""Napoleon Dynamite"" great in at least one of the afformentioned criteria for good films, the movie might have been a salvageable train wreck.  But despite its long list of shortcomings, it seems to have captivated some audiences.  I suppose an hour and a half of watching a squinting, mouth-breathing social outcast be picked on is entertaining to some.  Luckilly, I can say, ""not this critic!"""	1.0	82 Minutes That I Would Like Back	2005-02-27	23	8	15

I like roses - you like daisies...but does that automatically make me superior to you, more intelligent than you, a whiz with proper punctuation (obviously not!)?I do not believe the trick to appreciating these movies is about ""getting it"". Everyone approaches life AND movies from a different perspective.  Liking or disliking a movie should not be a litmus test for someone's I.Q. I will assume that those who didn't like this movie (and GOD FORBID actually slandered ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") have reasonable I.Q.'s.  No matter how tempting it is to think otherwise.  All deserve the benefit of the doubt.As an aside, however, I must protest the application of the word ""retarded"" that was used in one review.  I find the word offensive and respectfully ask that people would refrain from using it in public forums such as these, regardless of the context intended.  It is not a nice word in this day and age to use to describe any thing or any one. Please choose another word from your vocabulary to express yourself, if you would. But I digress.There is a crowd that will love Monty Python, Best in Show, Spinal Tap, etc. and there are those that will watch these types of movies in a more literal sense, and be unable, for whatever reason, to see the humor in them at all.  To me, that is ok.  Not everyone has to like everything that everybody else does.  The difference here is that some of the ""reviewers"" seem to be steadfast in the idea that if a movie does or does not measure up to their own personal criteria for humor, then the opposing side, by default, MUST be stupid, or wrong, or humorless.  Can we not even practice tolerance for other people's senses of humor?To me, this kind of humor, as in the other movies mentioned above and scores more like them, is priceless. To others, worthless.  To me, these types of movies, including Napoleon Dynamite, share a theme in that the humor in them is deftly wound around scenes and dialogue that must, in a way, be ""decoded"" in order for one to appreciate the hidden layers of humor hiding beneath the surface. If it is ""about"" anything it is about not taking oneself too seriously, which ever of these films you are watching.You and you and you -  don't have to like them.  I think they are brilliant.

""So stupid it makes you laugh"", said one friend.Finally, I rented Napoleon Dynamite and sat down and saw a pretty nice little story about some simple lives in a place I'll never get to go. When I got back to my friends, I told them it was a cool little movie and that i really enjoyed it, but they had forgotten to tell me it is about autism and functioning with that disorder.Now I am locked in disagreement with my friends. They say Napoleon and Pedro are not playing autistic teens but are just dumb nerds. I say Napoleon, Pedro, and possibly others, are very autistic and the signs are right there in the audio and video.Napoleon is not really ""connected"" to people or the normal flow of life. He tries to communicate but cannot connect anything more complicated than a question and an answer. Napoleon has a fascination with rythmic movement (dance) and spinning rotations (tetherball) - that's autism. Napoleon sometimes experiences rushes of emotion that he has no idea how to process and it freezes his brain - key the scene when he first sees the suit of clothes in the thrift store. Pedro is similarly also in his own world. It's very obvious.So, there you have it, the insightful movie I saw (and very much enjoyed) and the stupid movie my friends saw (and very much enjoyed).

For instance, the scene where Napoleon fails to make the bicycle jump and hits his crotch on the bike frame. I agree, not one of the scenes that most people reference as jokes are funny. It's not meant to be funny. It's meant to be nostalgic.The opening music, ""We're Going to Be Friends"" a sentimental piece about childhood by the White Stripes sets the nostalgic tone for the entire movie. Every scene from the credits onward is meant to evoke sympathy for the main character, not humor. It would be hard stretch for anyone to think that getting hit with food is the pinnicle of comedy. However, to anyone that was alienated in high school, getting hit with food was just one of the things you had to put up with. Seeing Napoleon put up with it in a dignified way allows people who were in his position reclaim some of their own dignity.All throughout the movie Napoleon is faced with situations that would make most people cry. He perseveres and stays true to himself, just like he tells Pedro to do before the class president speech. It is this process of taking comfort from bitter situations or even courageously quipping a one liner in the face of dehumanizing alienation that gives this film its infectious charm.If you go into the movie prepared to laugh at Napoleon or anyone else in the movie you will be sorely disappointed. To really find humor in this movie you are forced to find humor in your own past alienation. Unfortunately for some people this is too difficult to do, and they come away from this movie dissatisfied. Those who are able to laugh at themselves will find this movie to be satisfyingly bitter sweet."	5.0	a self directed humor	2005-06-07	20	19	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1X12F0KC8GY6M	FLbeachbum	"Though just a quirky and imperfect independent film, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" obviously has struck a chord (nerve?) with many, seeing how there are already over 1100 viewer reviews on this site alone. I don't have time to read them all but I did make time to watch the movie, which I'm happy to report I survived unscathed (I had my doubts). In fact I think it merits at least 3.5 stars, 1) for daring not to follow a totally predictable formula and pattern, 2) for actors who all deserve a ""thumbs up"", 3) for piquing my interest in what it might be like to live in such a place as Idaho. Regarding the last point, it's always assumed that small-town or rural residents are often aspiring to acquire a more cosmopolitan sophistication, but no one ever considers the reverse. Having grown up near a major metropolitan area however, I'm awed by vast stretches of nothingness, and I dare say I'm not the only one. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" gives me pause to mull over just such an upbringing, with unconventional family members to boot.As for the actual storyline of this movie; hey, you've got hundreds of other reviews to peruse, so you'd best get started. But you'll have to see the movie yourself, because ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a tough one to second-guess just by reading others' opinions."	4.0	A 'Private Idaho' Revisited	2005-10-04	1	1	0

I rented it on the premise of all the merchandise that everyone is sporting. I feel in love with all of the characters. Kip is my favorite. I think that this is a film that shows how people envision themselves. As one reviewer stated, Napoleon ( and Pedro for that fact) does not see himself as a geek.He does what he does because he is Napoleon. Some of my favorite parts are with Tina the llama ( I don't know why-I guess there was a time when we all hated to feed the pet llama), and any scene with Kip especially Kip and Lafawnda.

I sat down and never got up.This film is hysterical, bizarre, and hits you from many different angles.  Everyone has known nerds like Napoleon - they are timeless although the fads and cliques of highs schools forever change.  So everyone can relate to it.  But liking the movie is a different matter. ND's character as an ""anti-hero as hero"" works (as does his ""stuck in the past"" Uncle), but somehow Pedro and Kip almost push the movie in another direction, which to me is the film's only ""flaw"".  Pedro just ""doesn't work"" and Kip's nerdiness (unlike ND's, which is brilliant) is too stereo-typical, reminiscent of some early Saturday Night Live skit.The real key to enjoyment of this movie is not to take it seriously.  I even laughed at many of the 5-star reviews, some of these critics read far more into this film than I would ever dare.  Same with the ND ""haters"" - they either have no sense of humor at all or see it as ""cruel"".Just have fun and watch the flippin' movie, O.K?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	"I had a bit of skepticism going into watching this film because of all the praise it had received. Usually those types of movies don't live up to the hype after all. It is true that there are two types of comedy: those that rely more on slapstick humor, and those that are more of a deadpan kind of humor. This movie definitely is the latter, and based on which kind you find more appealing may determine whether this movie is for you. However, as far as being in a class all its own, Napoleon Dynamite definitely deserves that distinction, as it is one of the more refreshing comedies to come out in a long time. It does not rely on nudity, profanity or potty jokes to get its laughs; rather, it uses the oddities of its characters and their unlikely situations.Napoleon Dynamite, which was made by MTV, is a movie that chronicles the high school life of one geeky teenager (Napoleon), and uses odd characters and situations to gain much of the humor Some notable characters are Pedro (the new kid at school that Napoleon befriends, who eventually decides to run for class president), Napoleon's 32 year old brother Kip (who lives at home with Napoleon and chats online to women) and Uncle Rico (Napoleon's sleazy and macho uncle, who apparently is still living in the 80s).  Napoleon is the kind of guy that some may classify as being odd, weird, eccentric, unusual or maybe a little of all of those. His mangy orange hair and monotone voice seem to add to his unusual personality.  Both at school and at home he tends to get himself into unusual circumstances and predicaments.This is one movie that really didn't need a plot, mainly because its strength is its characters and their ridiculous situations. For instance, there is a segment where Kip talks Napoleon into going to a self-defense program called Rex Kwan Do that is hilarious. Rex is a loud, aggressive, obnoxious body builder type who wears a bandana with stars on it, yellow glasses, a polo shirt with his name on it, and work out pants that are red, white and blue. After Kip volunteers to be the guinea pig while Rex demonstrates his methods on him, Rex exclaims boldly to the class of listeners, ""No more flying solo! You need someone watching your back at all times!"" There is also a funny scene where Pedro runs for class president and Napoleon, who had been practicing dancing, does a solo dance for the class after Pedro's speech.Uncle Rico's character really stole the show in many respects. After Napoleon's grandmother leaves town for a few days, Uncle Rico comes to watch over Napoleon and his brother. Rico is obsessed with the idea of going back to 1982 so he could relive a high school football game and make the critical pass in a game.  He eventually gets Kip to buy a time travel machine online, which, of course, doesn't work. He also invites Kip into a little business endeavor where they are selling items door to door. Eventually Napoleon becomes angry because Uncle Rico is pestering everyone around him, even the girl at school who likes Napoleon, with his business.Although the movie seems to be stuck in two different time periods, I thought the film was an original idea for a comedy. Far too often comedies have become formulaic and this is one movie that doesn't have a predictable mode to it. Normally these types of odd characters in a film only go so far (as we have seen with many of the Saturday Night Live skit based movies), but Napoleon Dynamite works well, and doesn't try too hard for laughs, which probably gives it more of an appeal. Overall I thought it was hilarious, and would recommend at least giving it a try."	5.0	Dynomite!	2005-01-01	10	8	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2VTZAPAOYB3ZN	Franklin Green	"Hilarious movie. The movie is character driven instead of plot driven. The lack of plot makes you focus on the characters more. You care about the main characters even uncle Rico in the end. The main themes in the movie are alienation and diversity. The movie is completely clean and its success is attributed to its unforgetable characters. The last scene where Napoleon tells Deb ""I caught you a delicious bass"" will be remembered as one of the most romantic moments on film.The film is made and acted by mostly Brigham Young University (Mormon) film school graduates. This explains why it is so clean. I am also Mormon and the movie is very much an inside joke about Mormons living in the small towns along the Idaho and Utah border. Napoleon wears a yellow t-shirt in the movie that says Ricks College which is an Idaho Mormon college. Napoleon says things like Gosh! and Flippin! instead of cursing and that is typically Mormon and makes me laugh because it is dead on. Also, like Napoleon, Mormons have sweet dance moves."	5.0	Napoleon Dynamite Is Filled With Memorable Characters	2006-06-15	6	4	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AA0JFFRHPYWE7	Fuchtel	Napoleon Dynamite is a movie requiring good humor, so not all people will love it.  Ratings given to this film are either white or black.  If you do not love this movie, then you will find it to be the worst film ever made.  The humor of this film is not for everyone, either you find it funny or you do not notice that a joke has been made at all.  If you begin watching this movie and are not laughing at all, I advice that you watch no further because the lame jokes you didn't laugh at are the only worthwhile points of this film.  There is no chance for character development or any deeper plot as the movie is set only in a single average day of a nerdy teenagers life.  However, the people who did laugh will notice Napoleon is a completely deadpan character lacking any emotion what so ever, this quality adds to the hilarity of the movie's jokes.  With a character like Napoleon, who needs a story?  All you need to watch this movie is a little bit of patience to wait for the next unintentional joke from Napoleon.  If you can manage through the slow moving pointless parts, the jokes are worthwhile.  If you find that the jokes are not worthwhile, it is pointless for you to watch.  Within five minutes you should know which way you will be leaning in you opinion of this film.  In truth, the first five minutes all but develop the plot to it's fullest and show you the form of humor that will be repeated the entire film.  The movie overall...is a hit or miss.  Even if you don't like the movie, you should at least watch the dance scene.  If you do not like the dance scene, you are totally beyond being helped.  You will never laugh again.  You should probably just end your life now.  Try not to be too selfish in taking your own life...at least make sure your death is not a messy one.  You parents might be a little less angry if there isn't blood everywhere...good luck.	5.0	hit or miss...	2005-01-23	4	2	2

I don't agree with his assessment that this film is depressing, and the only people who would laugh at Napoleon are people who feel superior to him. I laughed because I think anyone who wasn't part of the ""popular"" crowd in high school can relate to Napoleon's efforts to make a place for himself in his school and get a girl, regardless of how cluelessly he goes about it. Most people who were a little different from their peers as a teenager can relate to Napoleon, Pedro and Deb and their crusade against the shallow popular kids who look down on them. I had a friend in high school who ran for a student council position using a crazy gimmick - it didn't work for him, but this movie made me remember that and laugh. The movie is basically plotless but unbelievably funny. A lot of the humor is ""laugh at, not laugh with"" but does that make it a bad film? No.I think this compares a lot with ""The Big Lebowski"" (another incredibly funny movie) in that it's a picture about misfits and the lives they lead, and the ham-handed, screwball ways they go about accomplishing a goal. Just like Jeff Lebowski, Napoleon is unlikeable in a lot of ways, but the character is so earnest it's hard not to develop some kind of affection for him. I highly recommend that anyone - not just teenagers - see this movie. It's touching and funny in just the right way.(p.s. Most of the people who are giving this movie 1-star reviews are either functionally illiterate or they use lots of really large, complicated words in their reviews so they can sound as pompous and elitist as possible.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	"I did not know much about this independent comedy, until I saw it last weekend. I had heard that it was a surprise favorite at 2004 Sundance festival where it was met with non-stop laughing. Since I admire off-beat humor and am a big fan of a good comedy, I was ready to love or at least like ""Napoleon Dynamite"". I was sorely disappointed. The best and the funniest thing about ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (2004) is its title. By the title alone I expected the movie and its main character to be charismatic and brave as Napoleon I and explosive as dynamite or at least, unpredictable, fresh, and original. Guess what, it is none of the above. First and foremost, the movie is so boring, slow, and non-interesting that I could hardly manage to sit through it. Yes, I've read the comments that Napoleon, and his two equally sleep-walking friends, Pedro, the most impossible candidate for school president and Deb, the girl we should believe Napoleon might have a crush on  and few more high school clich&eacute; characters are exactly like the regular students in a regular high school. Even if it is true and I hope that it is not always the case, I don't have to sympathize with the trio of walking zombies. ND and his friends are so bored and boring that their boredom becomes contagious - for me it was. I did not find anyone on the screen slightly interesting, leave alone sympathetic. Well, there was one exception, Napoleon's and his older brother Kip's, 32 years old Internet chat rooms addict's  grandmother who was injured in a dune buggy accident (that sounded interesting or at least promising) and taken from the screen after the first fifteen minutes. She was lucky - she did not have to endure the presence of her complete idiot-nephew Rico, the ex-jock of the 1982, a door-to-door salesman, whose adventures or projects did not contribute a single funny scene or even a joke to this sophomoric excuse for a movie.While trying not to fall asleep, I was thinking of the others, more successful and much better first movies that might have been the inspiration for ND. Wes Anderson's debut, ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) even if not a masterpiece is often hilarious and always original. Todd Solondz's first feature which explores the similar subject, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" (1995) is a terrific film - brave, and passionate - real dynamite.

I found this movie to be very funny that has jokes at the right time. It's not that anything extremely funny ever happens, it's just the way Napoleon reacts to the environment around him. He's dressed like a nerd but talks like a spoiled/whiney kid. Making up stories to impress people who will never like him, eating in class, fending off bullies while trying to keep a cool status with the ladies, it's like being back in high school all over again!I think a lot of people relate to this movie, especially us not-so-popular ones.

It also was extremely creative and when the credits roll you just wish it were not over, and guess what, it is not.

The other side contains a LETTERBOXED version, not, as the package says, an anamorphic 1.85:1 version.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a film by Jared Hess and stars Jon Heder. It's an independent film, more or less, featuring quirky characters, but unlike so many other independent films in this vein, it's not depressing or malicious. It's a lighthearted comedy with heart and personality, and a very quotable one at that. I don't remember it coming out in theatres here in Australia (I first heard about it here on amazon), but it has gone on to be a big hit on DVD. I've even seen a ""Vote For Pedro"" t-shirt or two being worn up in the city.Napoleon Dynamite lives in an American country town. He loves to draw mythical beasts, dreams of numchucks and bo skills, plays tetherball, feeds his aunt's llama every day and doesn't have many friends. After going to a self defense course with his brother Kip, he is told that he has to have someone to watch his back. Fortunately, there's a new kid at school, a Mexican immigrant called Pedro. There's also Deb, a girl who left a whole box of merchandise she was selling on his doorstep for college money. The school dance is coming up, so is the school election, and Napoleon's uncle Rico is in town, a man who is stuck in 1982, in his glory days as a footballer. Also on the calendar is a meeting between Kip and La Fawnduh, his internet girlfriend. Do Napoleon, his family and friends have the skills to get through the year?The film has a tacky, domestic kind of setting, and in that way it reminds me a bit of the Australian TV series ""Kath and Kim"", though that show doesn't feel quite as detatched and awkward as this film does. It's a good detatched and awkward though, it goes with and adds to the characters I think. They're all a bit out of the ordinary, but there's a kind of sense to what they're doing. Some of the fun I had watching this was trying to figure out what the characters were thinking and how they really felt about each other (Napoleon and Deb's friendship, for instance). Being set in Jared Hess' home town helped a bit, I think. He would have known where to go, what backdrops he wanted against the plot.I could relate to a few of the characters in this film. I don't know anyone exactly like Napoleon, but I know a few people who have a few ""Napoleon"" elements. I know back in high school I used to draw pictures of weird creatures, and of girls in my class (though I never sent pictures to the girls like Napoleon did). I knew people who were way into the self-defense stuff, and one or two people who have Napoleon's way of replying. Maybe there's a bit of Napoleon (or Kip or Deb or Pedro) in a lot of people.Special features on the regular edition include a making of the after-credits scene, and an audio commentary with Jared Hess and Jon Heder, recalling anecdotes and influences for the film. A lot of it is actually from Jared's life, it seems.Definitely worth a look if you're interested."	5.0	A Dynamite Film (With Skills)	2006-11-17	2	1	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AO13TNMQBPLZE	"Gene Twilley ""GTwilley"""	Sometimes the hilarity of a moment comes through a discourse or sentence that cuts through the boundaries of life and stops a conversation dead. Napoleon Dynamite is full of one liners that my friends and I just can't stop saying, and they're the kinds of things that we can equate with so many of the other people we know.The art of this film is that it portrays its heroes and villains in such a subtle way. We learn to sympathize with Pedro in his rise to glory. Our hearts cry out in anger against the bullish nature of Uncle Rico and the popular kids. Still, we cannot help but leave this movie mourning the sadness of all the lives represented.This movie is not without happy endings. Redemption comes in the form of relationships as we see healing borne in Grandma and her reuniting with her beloved llama. Rico is found again by a lost love who hated to dwell on the past. Kip draws together two cultures as he marries someone who is so completely different than himself.I laughed out loud in the theater when I watched this movie, and again when I watched it with my wife. It's great to watch something that can be so funny and yet still not be bombarded with sexual innuendo (with the exception of Rico's prescribed herbal enhancers and the principal's odd smile while watching highschoolers dance) and rampant violence.The DVD itself is full of wonderful features, great commentaries, and is double sided (full screen or wide screen). If you don't buy it, then at least try it. Be warned, however, as most all either hate the movie or they love it.	5.0	Wonderfully Smart	2005-02-17	4	4	0

"Nearly everyone at work is quoting this movie, and after being asked 100 times if I've seen Napolean Dynamite, I finally rented it.  I found it a little easier to comprehend than Rushmore as far as off-beat character movies go, and there were some funny moments in the film.  I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't put it in my top ten list of funny movies.Someone mentioned that this movie is so stupid it's funny.  I don't know if that could accurately describe it, because I didn't think the movie was stupid.  It has a very deadpan style about a high school nerd and his friends, his 32 year old brother and his scheming Uncle and their daily lives.  You'll note that the ""popular crowd"" or ""anti-heros"" are jovial personality-wise while everyone else seems half-stoned, half concerned and half asleep.  Napolean intersperses his flatliner demeanor with the occasional ""Fine!"" or ""Idiots!""  Those are probably the most quotable parts of the movies.  No cosmic intelletual themes in here which is nice.  None of the cliched high school expressions of wanting a girlfriend yet still an interesting angle at getting a girl go to the dance with you.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AQSQLWD3NLMAS	Glenn A. Buttkus	"This is a small film, a very good one, told large. The director, Jared Hess, is a 24 year old wunderkind from the barrens of Preston, Idaho, and he has created a gem; a cousin to the Coens. This is a comedy that will sneak up on you, the stuff of belly laughs. Last year he did a 9-minute short film, PELUCA, starring Jon Heder, and it seems to have been the outline for this feature film. Hess is from Preston, and he filmed it as only a resident could; full of empty landscapes, lonely roads, farmers, ranchers, and rednecks. A scene where Napoleon gets a job for the day on a chicken ranch is worth the price of admission.There have been numerous comparisons for this movie to WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and RUSHMORE. But for me this film stands firmly on its own. It plays out like an absurdist straight drama that also happens to be funny. It is reminiscent of some of the best moments in the Coen Brother's RAISING ARIZONA.The film was a big hit at Sundance, and it has been distributed well; a lucky break for Hess. Wouldn't it be wonderful if more of the youth of our country could rally behind this tiny epic, and create it as a cult film; that for a moment they step away from the commedia del raunchy that they mostly immerse themselves in; that they actually laugh at themselves, the way they really are, just kids struggling to grow up? The 13-30 year old demographic dictates our art, our music, and our movies. This little film could go a long ways in restoring the missing heart, the naivete and grace to the comedic genre.One real plus for me was the odd wholesomeness of this movie. There was zero profanity. Most of the time when a script deletes realistic high school vernacular, and changes the language to a lot of goshs, dangs, hecks, frigging, and freaking, it usually morphs quickly into the landscape of the lame. But somehow, Hess makes the lack of profanity work, and we don't miss it.Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Jon Heder,"" geek deadpan perfection."" He loved the film, and directs us,"" to laugh until it hurts."" Heder is a lanky beanpole with a red Afro, all Adam's apple and oversized glasses, and overbite. At first glance one sees a young Yahoo Serious, or a Scott ""Carrot Top"" Thompson. But no, Heder is more natural, more believable, more absurd, and wonderfully unselfconscious. He is less the over-the-top screamer. In his best moments, like when he played tetherball with himself, or practiced his killer dance moves in his room, he reminded me of some of the great clowns; like a young Jerry Lewis, and even the precursory shadings of the great ones like Jackie Gleason in GIGOT, or Jacques Tati. Heder is Napoleon Dynamite, a prince of Preston, a nerdish Conan out to slay demons, or maybe just to get laid.The setting for the film seems to be the early 1990's. Napoleon, and his older brother, Kip, live with their grandmother, played by Sandy Martin, who does a great turn as a biker grandma, who still dates, eats entirely too much steak, and loves her llama. Aaron Ruell, as the brother Kip, a 32 year old who has been a nerd for so long he is oblivious to it, does a fine job with the role. He lives in front of his computer, logging countless hours in chat rooms, searching for cyber-love, running up huge internet bills. Tina Mjorino, as girlfriend Deb, was wonderfully wacky, off-center, and loveable. A former child star, from films like WATERWORLD, she is 19 years old now, and she is good enough to be slugging it out with the likes of Thora Birch, Jena Malone, and Christina Ricci for those Odd Girl parts. She found the sweet quirkiness and heartfelt honesty of her character. Jon Gries, an actor since 1968, son of famed film director Tom Gries, was very good as the arrogant deluded ignorant Uncle Ricco; a man stuck in the past, reliving a fake fantasy that when he played high school football he might have been a great star, even turned pro...if his stupid coach had not left him on the bench so much. Efrem Ramirez, as Napoleon's best friend, Pedro, is a veteran actor from 10 films. His baby face, and deadpan delivery served him well. He did an excellent job. When he decided to run for class president, against a popular cheerleader, the tempo begins to shift, and we begin to see that this sad and funny drama was going to bend into a kind of fantasy tale; with underdogs rising to the occasion, taking on overwhelming odds, and of course, emerging victorious.In smaller roles we first find Diedrich Baker as the karate teacher Rex, and he is the most seasoned veteran of the cast, having appeared in 33 films. He had a lot of fun with this part, prancing around in his American flag ""bad-boy"" pants, and pushing around the local kids while taking their money. Then there is Shondrella Avery appearing as Kip's cyberlove La Fawnduh. She is one hot mama, and she seems to like short skinny white dudes. When Kip boards the bus with her, bandana on his head, glasses in his pocket, suitcases in his hands, leaving home for the first time, we realize the film has come full circle, and now is a fairy tale.I had approached this film skeptically not being sure how I would react or relate to it...but it won me over. It was not just another dumb comedy that would disintegrate two points off my intelligence quotient just by sitting through it. Rather, it was a fine little film, large on ambition, that I came to care about. I recommend it highly."	4.0	The Prince of Preston	2008-02-07	4	4	0

The main character, Napoleon Dynamite, is hilarious and so is his brother Kip (whose attitude is sexy). The only complaint that I had was the timing.  There were very large chunks of time that nothing really happened, and there really isn't a plot. The story seemed a bit drawn out and thin, too. On the other hand it stands out from other comedies in its originality and focus on detail.  Just looking at John Heder,(Napoleon)is enough to make you laugh.

The point of the movie was that it had no plot. What possible plot can the school- and home- life of the nerdiest nerd ever devised have? Any palpable plot that pervaded the entirety of the movie would have been against the point of the film. Napoleon Dynamite is a guy who stumbles through life trying to do what he can with what he has. The problem is, though, that his life is extremely dull and boring, so he does things that are hilarious and endearing. For instance, he plays tetherball with his feet, with devastating results, plus the ball gets wrapped around the pole. All of us who were geeks in high school can relate to that. And he has the funniest voice in the world. The things he does in the movie... I watched and every five seconds shouted, ""That's what I would have done!"" For instance, he attempts to vault a fence and ends up falling on his back. Napoleon has none of the coolness extant in all other movies these days. And this has no alcohol, drugs, or whatever, which makes for a refreshing change. Those who don't like this movie don't understand high-school life for those not in the 'in' crowd, and the utter hellish boredom of life in general.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A10F5LMYPXQYDF	grerp	"This is a more ""realistic"" High School Nerd movie - realistic in that Napoleon isn't a particularly stylized nerd.  His clothing is unique, perhaps, but there are tons of adolescent guys who draw fantasy creatures, sulk, never appear to pay attention, act awkwardly with girls, and/or never quite clue into the intricacies of social interaction.For those viewers who enjoy plot-driven action movies: this is not the film for you.  It essentially has no plot and is, rather, a series of vignettes and sight gags about a high school boy whose small-town life in Idaho is both mundane and bizarrly embarrassing.  As the commentary states, most of these vignettes are based on people and things that actually happened to the actors/writers/directors, as hard as that is to believe (i.e., the time machine bit).Napoleon Dynamite is filmed almost in documentary style, which lends a certain wry, understated quality to the many, many sight gags the viewer is treated to.  The movie parodies the absurdity of people and life, but much more intelligently than most other comedies.  This is not Dumb and Dumber.While watching this movie, I continually asked my husband, ""What the heck is this about?""  Napoleon Dynamite is original filmmaking and rather difficult to describe or even, sometimes, comprehend.  But it is funny and it is well done.

Jon Heder and Jared Hess both have interesting things to say about the project, and recount stories from their lives which tie in with scenes in the film.Also, when you realise that half the people in the movie were local towns folk, it gives it an extra dimension.The teachers are played by real teachers from the school.  The school cafeteria in the movie is real, and apparently makes a decent chili.The houses are real, inside and out. And just about every scene has a story behind it and features at least one of the seemingly endless number of brothers of the crew.I was surprised at how many real life residents of Preston they used - they've done a brilliant job and delivered very believable performances.I particularly loved that every person in the film got a credit - even the kids in the auditorium scene :)I recommend it, and I have to say that I do feel sorry for those who ""don't get it"" becuase you're really missing out on something great."	4.0	Acquired taste - but once you have it, it's addictive	2006-05-24	6	5	1

All charcters seem very lifelike as if you deal with them everyday. I think everyone can relate to one charcter or another in this film in one way or another. That's what makes them so likeable.

One of the very few movies with no swearing and no sex, showing all it takes is some good original thinking to make a classic! I'm sure you'll be adding it to your collection.

I knew kids like these guys in High School so I kind of liked the movie. It was a lifestyle that does happen but not to me. It was not a movie that I would walk out on but it was not a movie that I would say was really really funny. Now A Fine Mess was really funny and had goofy guys in it.Overall the movie was a touch below average for movies.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3C6ZCBUNXUT7V	"G$ ""Z-Wad"""	After hearing a lot of hype about this movie, I had to see it and I did not like it.  It is a dull comedy with jokes that aren't really that funny. The main character is a dork who really does nothing but draw mythical creatures.  He makes 2 friends, a shy girl and a Mexican who barely talks english. Him and the mexican try to get dates for a dance and then run against the popular girl in school for class president.  After a funny, and very good dance (the funniest part in the movie)  by Napoleon the school loves it, but they never shows if they won or not.  Napoleon then at the end starts to date the shy girl and his dorky brother who meets a sexy black woman on the internet gets married to her after she has him dressing like a gangsta and the movie ends.  No real point to the movie and I'd avoid it.	2.0	Dissappointing	2005-01-20	7	1	6

And thats pretty much all it does except when its dead. The nerd soul that resides in Napoleon Dynamite is something similar. He has a few chosen interests and his life activities revolve around absolutely nothing. He seems like a new born with his ""I do not gain anything from what happens around me "" self.When the movie started , It was difficult to believe such a character. For some reason I wanted him to change and be a little *  * i dont have the word here.Anyhow,overall this movie can be exhaustive for some. There was no scene I found funny and I'm not a serious guy really. It's just kind of sad,especially. It started at around 5AM in the morning.What I liked about the film was the sincere effort in portraying the lives of a nerd and the lack of activity. Pedro's good. I think the dance (solo) was quite interesting. It makes me want to be a dancer. Many reviews back on amazon I'd read this movie is nothing like ever shown. I thought it actually must be something that nooone has ever made.Now that I've seen this film , its just there looking me in the face with its ""burn into obscurity"" effect.Too bad , I can't find a valid comment to sum it up.Watch it,if you think beyond numbers and alphabets."	3.0	"""Just To Add My Watching A Fly At Work"""	2005-04-13	3	0	3

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2SXSN1JBEUP7C	Harvey S. Jacobs	"I knew absolutley nothing about this flick when my 14 year old red-headed math whiz son said Dad let's go see this movie. From the opening credits I was entertained. This movie, is essentially a ""day in the life of an Idaho high school nerd as he moves through various life cycle events and characters.""  Though the word ""nerd"" hardly seems to do justice to the timeless nature of title character Napoleon Dynamite. With little or no plot, Napoleon turned out to be more than part nostalgia. It was a stroll down memory lane. If I did not know that the writers in fact lived in Idaho, I would have sworn they had gone to my High School in South Florda in the late 70's. Our Senior Class Vice-President was in fact PEDRO from Mexico, our class Secretary, Melanie a blonde buxom cheerleader incarnate of this films' fictional ""Summer"" character and our Treasurer sported a huge Afro and all were clad in their finest disco outfits.I guess this is why this sleeper film has gained such popularity. Forty-something dads and their teen kids can both see this movie together and come out repeating its hysterical dialogue.  The current crop of teen viewers are living these absurd stereotypes and situations (dating, class elections, high school dances, the cafeteria). The oldsters in the audience either were, or knew one or more of this film's quirky characters.The acting and dialogue are pure genius in their simplicity and absurdity. As other reviewers have mentioned, lines from this flick will become folklore. I found myself sitting around our family dinner table spouting off Napoleonisms reminiscent of the best of Monty Python.Definitely go see this movie without any pre-conceptions, or expectations, you will be pleasantly surprised."	5.0	"Geeeze Don't be an ""Idiot"" just see it!"	2004-10-24	41	40	1

Everyone was urging me to see it, claiming it was the ""funniest movie ever!"". So I succumbed, (no, not agreed, SUCCUMBED)and saw the movie.It generally started off slow, and then took a gradual dip in pace- before stopping completely! This movie was awful. Horridly filmed and acted(even for a dumb movie) with a slow, boring pace, and a script pockmarked with failed humor.I tried to laugh, I really did, but nothing came out. I just couldn't. Something was missing, besides a plot and a good joke.Now, this review may prompt you too see it just so you can witness how dumb it really is, but even that is a waste of time. This movie is a disgrace to the film industry, and fails even as a movie trying to be dumb. It's worse then dumb: it's bad.To give you a taste of napolean dynamite, I'll give you a fan favorite: Napolean is in the office on the phone, begging his brother to pick him up cause ""His lips hurt real bad"". Har har. Whover wrote this script probably thought: I'll make tons of money by glamourizing a typical seventies nerd, and presenting the movie as an ""independant film""( the fact that it was independant appealed to me because I had never seen an independant comedy).In this movie you'll laugh at the tone of his voice, (if even that) and nothing more."	2.0	Disappointing......	2005-02-04	15	3	12

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A457S8SW690NM	hi	This movie is probably one of the most popular movies of the year. I mean, I hadn't seen it and everyone else had seen it and was talking about it. Some loved, some hated it. But, most of the people I knew seemed to enjoy it. So, when I was over at a friend's house and saw a copy of it, I decided to watch it. He had really enjoyed it and I...Well, first off, let me say that Jon Heder did a great job as Napoleon. I mean, this was the biggest nerd in the world. With his red hair, big glasses, big boots and stupid remarks.He's Napoleon, a nerd in Idaho who lives with his crazy grandma, old and pathethic brother and then his insane oncle Rico. Napoleon gets bullied around, isn't popular at all and only has 2 friends: Deb and Pedro. They are both also neat characters. The movie is often very interesting to watch and really fun. At other times, it seems really stupid and pointless. But, in the end, it was great fun and quite funny actually. Napoleon delivers laughs but I thought that ucle Rico was by far the funniest. He delivered loads of laughs. He is a pathethic man obssessed with eating steaks who thinks that he is the best football player in the world. Even though he isn't at all. Pedro is also very funny as are his mean and tough cousins. The movie has some quite hilarious moments that you'll remember forever. From uncle Rico's behavior, to Napoleon's boots and glasses, to everything else. It's just great. Also, Napoleon's brother is quite funny as is his girlfriend La Phonda. It's a really hilarious movie and I don't want to give away any of the jokes so that you can discover them on your own. I strongly recommend renting this stupid but really funny and interesting movie.	4.0	"3 and 1/2 stars.  ""I been practicing....some dance moves...."""	2005-07-12	1	0	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1CA84967R04CQ	"hippomaiden ""Emily"""	"Napoleon Dynamite is definitely not for everyone. The movie started out as a not very popular, maybe even underrated movie, and turned into maybe even an overpopulated movie. I've noticed that the people who make the biggest deal about it, wearing tshirts, reciting quotes, etc., were the people who liked the movie simply because of the frequent usage of the phrase ""freakin' idiot"", and tater tots. The ones who didnt really talk about it much were the ones with more of a grasp for the ""whimsical"" logic of ""Napoleon Dyanmite"", and the ones who appreciate the original sense of humor in the movie. The movie really has no plot or meaning, and most older adults would probably utterly despise it, or maybe just dislike it. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is also, in my opinion, not a ""kids"" movie in any way. I know too many small children who refer to the movie as ""a really funny movie with tater tots"", and too many kids and teenagers who enjoy the movie because of some of the pretty dumb quotes, often misinterpreted. Although the movie is appropriate for all audiences, I believe that basically the only person who can truly enjoy this movie is a geek, such as myself, or just someone with a somewhat logical appreciation for the past, and good sense of humor."	5.0	A Geek's Review of Napoleon Dynamite	2005-04-09	1	1	0

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2HUR4W8J84XUV	H. Quinn	Napoleon Dynamite was a great movie in theaters. It was original and completely pointless, and best of all, about five people in the whole world knew about it. But this all changed when it came out on DVD. It was advertised on MTV and probably your local cable provider, so you didn't have to go all the way to your local underground movie theater to see it. Lucky you! And now you can repeat all the same catch phrases over and over again to annoy all your classmates and suck all the fun out of the movie. Good job.

If you're not from Idaho or Utah, half the jokes probably won't even make sense.  I guess there's a certain sort of charm that the movie has, but I know that if I wasn't familiar with the Idaho/Utah/Mormon culture, I would think the movie is even dumber than it really is.  The first time I saw Napoleon Dynamite in the theaters, I didn't really like it.  Then I got the DVD as a gift, and enjoyed it much more the second time.  I guess I didn't have any expectations the second time, and the characters take a little time to get used to.  The DVD commentary fetaures the director and others talking about the movie.  Watch it and you'll see just how weird we Idaho/Utah folks are.  The movie is instantly quotable, and proves that a money-making movie can be made without profanity or sex.  The DVD is worth buying, because there's a short, independent film called Peluca on it that Napoleon Dynamite was based on.  The short film is hilarious, more funny than almost anything in the actual movie.  The short is pretty stupid too, but you can't help but laugh.  I still don't understand how this movie got so big.  It's unique and funny, but it's far from being a masterpiece of filmmaking.	4.0	Gosh!  Its sweeter if you're from Idaho or Utah...	2005-02-15	0	0	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ADEJYIFDD1QGL	I am so smart...S-M-R-T	"I will give Napolean Dynamite this: It IS original. Very original. On the other hand, it is also lame. Disturbingly lame. Before I saw this, my friends constantly raved to me, ""Oh my god, you have to see Napolean Dynamite!"" ""Well why?"" ""Becuase it's the funniest movie ever, dude!"" ""Funniest movie ever?"" ""Funnier than Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" And I thought, wow, if it's funnier than Monty Python, it is a must see. Oh, how dissappointed I was...The story begins with an extremely nerdy kid walking onto a school bus, where he then shuffles wierdly to the back of the bus. A kid waits for him. When he sits down, the kid asks, ""What are you going to do today, Napolean?"" to which he replies, ""Whatever I feel like, god!"" My friends laughed hysterically at it. I, however, did not.Now, often, when I told my friends that I really didn't like the movie Napolean Dynamite, they were in shock. They'd ask why? Hmm...Well in all honesty, I don't know. It might be because I could be an old, cruel, mean fart who does not enjoy other people having fun. It might be because...Well, just because. But I honestly don't think that those are the cases. I think it's because I just didn't find this deadpan comedy funny. I'm more into the dark, subtle humor that takes time to appreiciate and recognize.But alas, it seems to be just me that did not like the movie Napolean Dynamite. I give the creators five stars for truly making an original film, but I give them a very kindly one star for making the original film that sucks on the whole.All in all: Ya like dead pan comedies with scary nerds and no plots?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2ICW5OUWX2A2V	Ian	"When my sister rented Napoleon Dynamite at Blockbuster the other night, I didint expect much out of the movie, seeing as the title charachter looked really strange, and the adds that were run during the theatrical release didint help to win me over.  After watching the movie, I admit that it was a plesant little suprise that had me chuckling a lot during my initial viewing.If you want me to tell you what the plot is, I really won't get anywhere, because the movie has no real plot.  It's just a glimpse at the life of a high school nerd as he goes through a roughtly a month of his life.  As the movie moves from scene to scene, you never really know what to expect.  There's everything from a speech about japanese scientists trying to kill the loch ness monster, to time machines that need crystals to work.  The whole thing is so bizzare that it defies explenation.In an age where movies routinely have guns and huge explosions, Napoleon Dynamite has none of those things.  There's no special effects at work, there are no CGI elements, nothing.  The movie relies on it's charachters, and all of them turn in stellar performances.  Jon Heder is PERFECT as Napoleon.  With his monstorous 70's style glasses and ever open mouth, he's perfect as your steryotype nerd.  I love how his expression never changes during the movie.  I got the feeling that if he saw a nuclear explosion, he'd still have that bored look on his face.  It's a delight watching him.  The supporting cast is equally good, such as Napoleons dweeb thirty-fivish brother, his 80's obsessed uncle and the lovable Pedro.Other little things stand out here.  The music is both odd and disturbingly catchy.  The scenery of gorgeous Idaho is, well...gorgeous!  I love how Napoleon's house is retro 70's style, which matches his personality perfectly.  And a special nod must go to the dialoge, which has some of the funniest bits i've heard in years.  My favorite?  A certian scene with tupperware, ""Dangit!""In conclusion, I find Napoleon Dynamite to be an interesting movie that is really quirky and has a lot of charm.  I'd certianlly be interested in ""Napoleon Dynamite 2"" if they ever create one."	4.0	What an odd little quirk of a movie.	2005-02-19	1	1	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2B0XO8BTPRX7R	Ian Vance	"It's fairly safe to say, this far into the 21st century, that the decade of '00' seriously lacks a cultural identity/movement of its own, at least in contrast to the past five decades: the war years of the 40's, the isolationist Americana of the 50's, the Aquarius Ideals of the 60's, the decadence and disco-tinge of the 70's, the Me-Decade excess of the 80's, the angst and 'alternative' option of the 90's.  Thus, over the past couple years, an increasingly wistful, decidedly kitsche assimilation of the styles and media-motifs of the immediate-past has crept into the mass-consciousness, especially for those of the '00' youth, inexperienced and adrift on the ripple-shock tides of a simultaneous informational over-abundance and widespread social repression/reactionary meme in the wake of 9-11.  The ridiculous visual hubris and innocuous ignorance that seem intimately tied to the 70's and the 80's have become attractive to those seeking career revitalization (Gwen Stefani and Outkast being prominent recent examples) and for those wishing to ape a personal neo-retro style that, in equal measure quirky and twee, turns back from the sterile fashions of futurism, the devastating deconstruction of knowing too much, too soon (or, perhaps more truthfully, knowing too much and not nearly enough).  To wit: so chaotic and complex is our contemporary social animal, that retreating into golden-hued nostalgia, as propagated by VH1, is incredibly seductive to the scions of the Post-Cold War Information Era, a womb of unrepentant confidence and social ideal so sorely lacking in these trying times.  You know, back when our plutocratic-puppet president was actually a ~good actor~; back when men teased their hair with aplomb and were considered the macho quintessence; back when the cultural identity was safe, with easy pickings for either path of conformity or rebellion.  ""Things were better back then"" - which is all nonsense, of course, like most nostalgic reflection: despite the more fantastical Hollywood archive of the 70's and 80's, that era was plagued with just as much uncertainty and threatening factors as we are now: AIDS, Nuclear Holocaust, economic depression/inflation, Iran-Contra, corporation corruption and drug-addled inner city denizens...  The Grass is always Greener two decades past.Thus the timely release of *Napoleon Dynamite*, a movie that capitalizes on this retreat into the past, reveling in unabashed kitsche and resurrecting the hoary Revenge of the Nerd archetype within a firmly-80's teen-comedy structure.  The look of the film is carefully, meticulously crafted: fashion from the late 70's, video cassette players from the early 80's, the fake-organic interior decoration made popular in the 60's; complete with knick-knacks and kitsche of any era, including plastic green toy-soldiers and the random thrift-store sai.  Yet late-90's elements insinuate themselves into the film, defying our attempt to define it to this or that era: chat-rooms and the music of Jamiroquai and the Backstreet Boys inform the audience that the environment of *Napoleon Dynamite* is actually that of a time-warp Idaho local, past and present intrinsically woven via cultural artifacts, verbal expressions and the overall ambience of the film total, much like Wes Anderson's uber-quirky exegesis *The Royal Tenembaums*.  Past and the just-past merge; the threatening cloud of the future is utterly banished in this ugly-duckling fairy tale.  In this regard, I find *Napoleon Dynamite* to be a brilliant example of our retro-seduction, a borderline-exploitative wish fulfillment juggernaught with the ability to tempt the kitsche-craving of any age or temperament.And yet, as a film, I found Napoleon Dynamite sadly lacking, ineffectual as entertainment and about as deep as anything else stamped with the MTV seal of production, a somewhat boring affair that only incidentally rises above its trend-conglomeration ethic to produce a surprised chuckle.  Obviously I'm in the minority here, given the glowing reviews both on this page and from most mainstream critics; to give further example, this film was recommended to me from a high-school work associate who claimed he'd watched it four times in just two days.  It touched him, quite deeply, for reasons I suspect are congruent with my beginning-paragraph thesis.  I, however, struggled with this movie.  Napoleon himself is an unsympathetic caricature of the everyman geek; the fact that he so obviously ""lacks skills"" means that almost all comedic triggers associated with his actions and attitudes are a matter of laughing ~at~, rather than laughing ~with~.  Even worse, Pedro is the ultimate construction of a stereotype, tiptoeing around offensiveness.  Why does he want to be class president? Even Pedro doesn't know.  More interesting are Napoleon's brother, the grandmamma's boy seeking soul-mate status, and his uncle, a football-jock relic lost in the glory-days of `82.  Nearly all of those surprised chuckles I mentioned before stemmed from these two characters, but even they are not enough to sustain the movie as a whole.Now, it may seem that I'm being overtly harsh with this film, but I couldn't escape the notion that a good deal of *Napoleon Dynamite* was crippled by artistic laziness, an inescapable developmental ~complacency~ in regard to the core material.  Again and again, moments of potential humor lose substance; doubtless profound connotations are laid waste by the need to be clever.  This could have been a five-star classic, instead of the naval-gazing faux-indie anticlimax it ends up being.  Alas.I rate this movie three stars for its (un?) conscious attempt to epitomize the facile neo-retro trend that has so-far dominated '00'; its occasional moments of earned levity and undeniable clever faade; and for that final dance-sequence...dat boy has got some moovez, yo!"	3.0	Brilliant Kitsche Amalgamation, Swaddled in Complacency	2005-02-05	30	5	25

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2GVL9ANA583M9	"ish ""ka"""	"Here's a brief list of the problems I had with this movie:1.The acting sucked2.The dialouge sucked3.There was no plot4.There was no story5.There was no background6.There was no character development7.There was no humor8.There was no beginning9.There was no ending10.There was no explanation of any kind as to what the point wasNow I'm aware that there are movies out there that are still great, despite lacking one or two of these ingredients. Clerks, for example, features pretty bad acting and doesn't really have a beginning or an ending, but the dialogue was so clever and the characters were so well developed that it became one of my favorite movies. Napoleon Dynamite has nothing to hang its hat on.For the first 30 minutes I thought the big joke was that all the actors were retarded and that the film was made to poke fun at retards. After that I thought the big joke was that the actors took massive amounts of heroin or some other ""downer"" drug, and the director was trying to make an anti-drug statement. Evantually I came to the conclusion that no one connected to this movie had any idea what they were doing and just improved the whole thing. This had to be made up on the spot... because no writer on this planet could have sat down and written a movie this stupid with dialogue so bland it felt like I was watching pieces of tofu walk around my TV screen.To say that this movie was made by those at MTV might be a little redundant at this point. It's not that I don't watch MTV on occasion, but I think we can all agree that it has contributed to the downfall of this nation's youth more then any single entity. Apparently that now stretches to the world of motion pictures.There's no way to fully express the feeling you get watching this movie unless you've gone through it yourself. The closest I can get is being tied to a chair, having your eyelids taped open, while people shoot you full of drugs and force you to stare at naked pictures of Oprah for 10 days straight. When both activities are over you feel cheated, abused and infected.I know this movie is gaining a cult following... consisting largely of teens who have smoked all of their brain cells into oblivion most likely. And of course any movie completely devoid of entertainment value is sure to be loved by critics around the world (their minds long since turned to jello by having to watch Keanu Reeves movies). I for one, would love to track these critics down and put them all out of their misery. It's obvious to me they are no longer useful members of society if this is what they consider to be ""funny"".As for me, I just hope the scarring my mind took from being subjected to this piece of crap won't be permanent and that I can one day move past this traumatic experience.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1BPG96OBQQNW9	"""jack_metal"""	Let me start by saying this is a very pointless and stupid movie. And I can say, that it is so stupid and simple that its funny. The first time I saw it was a couple months ago in the theatres with a couple guys. We were at the mall and didnt know what to do, so we went to this movie called Napolean Dynamite because another guy recomended it. And let me tell you, I couldn't thank this guy enough. This is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I've seen it like 7x on dvd because we rented it. Its just a story about a couple nomral people living their boring lives. My favorite scene from the movie isn't funny, but very deep. The shot when the three of the main characters (Napolean, Perdo, and Deb) standing at the side of the dance, (shot from behind them) watching everyone else have fun and watching the world go by. But I have to say the best thing about this movie was that it was made by just normal guys. Listen to the commentary, its just three normal guys sitting around laughing about the movie and their experience making it. Its not some director saying &quot;Now the symbol in this scene is that the fire is above the ice, meaning that Joe's battle with himself...&quot;But anyway, I'm rambling again. So I'll end by telling you that this was a very funny movie. And it's highly recomended.(Listen to Children Of Bodom.)Jack Metal	5.0	Brilliant in its simplicity	2004-12-23	7	6	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ANYDF6GKK7PA4	"Jackson Zhou ""The Craftsman"""	"I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer for this film. I didn't know what to make of it. It looked like it was supposed to be a comedy, but the trailer, which was supposed to be a condensed and ""best of"" version of a movie (in this case the funniest moments of ""Napoleon Dynamite""), wasn't really that funny at all, at least not immediately and apparently. I was still intrigued, nonetheless. And finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a look at home, and I must say while I don't remember falling out of my seat from laughing at any point during the movie, it did bring a almost perpetual smile to my face with its sense of subtle and dry-witted humor. And it carried a feel good message throughout too.The film brings the trials and tribulations of high school adolescence to a level of quirkiness that is unseen in any other films that I've seen in this genre. Most of the film's delightfully eccentric humor can be attributed to its colorful cast of weirdoes: The main character Napoleon Dynamite who's friendless and painfully un-self-conscious about his nerdiness; His brother Kip, who's a 32 year old live-at-home self-professed lady's man; A self delusional uncle Rico, who peddles herbal breast size enhancement to the local women, and dreams of traveling back in time to the glory year of 1982, when he was the football star of his high school; just to name a few. One would also be exposed to the life of rural Idaho, where the next house is always a mile away, and where Napoleon earns a 6-dollars a day salary with the chicken farmers. The movie is funny because none of the characters are aware of their flaws and awkwardness, but somehow in the end good things happen to those who happen to be doing nothing but just being their weird little selves.While some may argue that there's no character development in this movie, I disagree. Napoleon for one clearly goes through a transformation during the film. He is a nerd and a conceited loser in the beginning, throwing around petty lies like claiming the girl in a promotional glamour shot is his girlfriend. But eventually he learns to be truthful to others, and most importantly to himself, by building meaningful friendships with those who can identify with him, and through unabashed self-expression.The moral message of self-expression is central to this movie and very admirable.  But ultimately I liked this film due the superb and genuine performance of its cast. The portrayals of the characters are very dead-on and that's a big part in what makes this movie funny and watchable."	4.0	Delightfully Eccentric	2005-01-27	2	2	0

Then he proceeds to throw an action figure out the window of the school bus tied to a piece of string.

I can't even remember how many times I've watched this film . . . I own the DVD and still can't resist watching it whenever it comes on a cable movie channel! If this is a cult comedy, I guess I'm a full-blown cult member!The movie is hilariious because of the quirky dialogue and outrageous character satire, making fun of the usual cast of high-school types - the popular cheerleader and primo jock, the school bully, the wallflower, the nerd, the alienated immigrant.  There's also the anti-PC jabs, such as eating beef steak for breakfast, lunch and dinner with no veggies in sight! For me the interest lies in how the movie presents a cultural anthropology of the changing rural Midwest.We know the internet is changing the world, and we see this in the movie when Napoleans' brother leaves for Detroit with an inner-city girlfriend he met through an internet chat room.Immigration is also changing the rural Midwest, as we see in Napolean's friend Pedro moving to small-town Idaho from Mexico.The family is also changing - Napolean lives with his grandmother and brother with no parents in sight.Thankfully, there were no drugs in the movie, even though they are changing rural America as much as anything.	5.0	Midwest cultural anthropology	2014-02-28	0	0	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1OSHUZ5WARTKK	"James G. Henderson ""jimghenderson"""	"For people like Roger Ebert who pan this movie... you just don't get it.I'm not claiming any intellectual superiority or great film taste... it's just that I get it.Perhaps because I see elements of Napoleon Dynamite in me.  For instance... his response on the bus ""whatever I feel like.  Gosh!"" When I was in 4th grade I moved from a northern town in Illinois (Geneseo) to a small town called Lousville (pronounced Lewis-ville) in very southern Illinois where the culture was very different and people had Alabama-like accents.  When I was riding on the schoolbus, my first day in mid-semester, I was petrified.  Everyone stared at me as they stopped at my delapidated trailer to pick me up.  A little girl turned around and asked ""What's your naaaaame?"" To which I replied ""shuuuuuuuuuuuut uuuuuup!"" And from that day on was greeted by everyone in unison shouting ""HI SHUUUUUTUUUP"" as I walked on the bus.  My reply was out of a vain effort at self-defense... not mean-ness.. and so was Napoleons.Napoleon's journey was a remarkable, willful transformation, as was that of Deb and Pedro.  Kip was amusingly transformed, but not so much with self-awareness.  Uncle Rico was the only static character, which made it all the more funny because he had not changed since 1982.Of all the lines, the one where Napleon told Deb to get her stuff  because there wasn't enough room for his nunchucks made me laugh the most hysterically.Almost all the humor, other than ""the dance"" was rooted in hilarious subtlety and satire.  I mean, how could I not be floored by someone bragging about chatting with hot babes online.... ALL DAY!The bizarre time-period (An elegant collage of the 70's, 80's, and 90's) gives this film a wide audience and uses silly things from all decades to make it more hilarious.My conclusion is that people who don't like this movie are either  1) TOO nerdy to realize they are only the one side of the nerdy characters  2) They ARE Summer Wheatley 3) People like Roger Ebert who are absolutely clueless about the level of subtle humor in this film.To the people comparing this to laughing at clowns... their reviews had me laughing as much as the movie... it's a total comedy in itself.  ND is not a clown, he's flippin Superman in moonboots with a fro!The ONLY other DVD I own is Monty Python's the Holy Grail... which also has incredibly intelligent subtle humor woven into the surface silliness.For the intellect and the funny bone, I give ND a 5/5 stars.  As far as those complaining about the ""terrible"" soundtrack, I wish I could give it 6/5 stars for having ""Forever Young"" by Alphaville and ""The Promise"" by When In Rome as too of the main songs in the soundtrack.This thing just gets funnier the more I watch it.P.S.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A34DS031H729JG	James J. Chriss	I've got to go along with the people who liked Napolean Dynamite.  John Heder depicts perfectly the nerdy high school male who is disaffected in virtually every area of life.  Even when his date skips out on him at the high school dance he could give a rat's ass.  Even when he gets pounded up against his school locker by hallway goons, big deal.  He just brushes himself off and goes about his nerdy way.  Pedro is great too, as are most of the cast.  The sleazy uncle is terrific, a loser always on the make trying to recapture past glory that was never really there to begin with.  And the older brother's online romance, and finally meeting his virtual sweetheart--a dominating black female about twice his size--is, well, just great.Okay, so a universe has been created and we get to observe its characters for awhile.  And it works for the most part.  The only reason I didn't give Napolean Dynamite five stars is because of the awkward and abrupt ending.  It just seemed like the director didn't know how to wrap it up.  Maybe that's consistent with the nature of this film, a parody through and through.	4.0	Pretty good flick	2005-10-07	2	0	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A39VJRIW7HC5C0	James Kunz	"Napoleon Dynamite, starring Jon Heder as the title character, is a comedy that is completely reliant upon ""This is so stupid it's funny.""  Now I consider myself something of a stupid-humor connoisseur, laughing (and laughing frequently no less) at movies like BASEketball, Dumb and Dumber, Scary Movie, There's Something About Mary, etc.  However, the difference between those movies and Napoleon Dynamite is that those movies make attempts at a plot, or at least a clothesline to hang jokes on, and they set up their jokes.  In most comedies there is a set-up and a punchline, and the audience laughs.  In Napoleon Dynamite, there's only stupidity, and the audience is expected to laugh regardless.It would be one thing if the movie at least bounced all over the place, so that even if a viewer like myself found some parts of it dry then at least there would be other sprinklings of humor to choose from.  Unfortunately, the movie also finds repetition funny.  Napoleon saying ""Gosh!"" ad nauseum or his uncle repeating over and over that ""if Coach would have put me 4th quarter we'd'a been state champions for sure"" is not humor.  At least the uncle gets credit for being remotely animated, as most of the characters- Napoleon, his brother, Pedro, and Deb speak in monotones for almost all of the movie.  Again, this is apparently funny.Unless you like 90 minutes of stupid sketch comedy (with no plot that's is exactly what the movie feels like) then avoid this film.  Unless of course you need to know phrases like ""I caught you a delicious bass"" to make conversation with middle school boys. 4/10"	2.0	Missing punchlines and a plot	2005-05-03	12	7	5
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A25WGJLN0ZLQTS	James Moore	There are a lot of crack users on Amazon, apparently.This movie is not funny.  It has an occasional moment here or there, and the ending is really, really funny.  But for the most part?  Terrible.Again, the biggest problem is it isn't funny.  The main character is an unlikeable loser.  Usually a movie will have a loveable loser, but this guy is a jack-off and a half.  Meanwhile, so is his brother and his uncle.There are only two characters that don't make you want to kill them, or yourself.  Those are the love interest and Pedro.  Both characters are nice people.  EVERYONE else in this movie is a terrible character and NOT funny.Did I mention this isn't funny?Don't waste your time, and especially don't waste your money.  You'll be REALLY pissed off.  Unless you're a teenager that has been led by MTV to believe this tripe is hilarious, you will hate it with the vile that I have for it.I also find it funny, WAY funnier than this movie, that everyone who liked it (ALL under 21) voted that my review wasn't useful.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ALJGB7XHPFCR	James R. Mckinley	Napoleon Dynamite is the story of a small town kid trying to find his way through the maze of high school, friendships, family, and romance. Unfortunately Napoleon encounters the roadblocks of an insane family, a total lack of social skills, and a geeky appearance. I loved this movie. We all knew Napoleon Dynamite in high school. Hell, some of us were Napoleon Dynamite in high school. It's that feeling of connection that makes this film so fun and heart-warming. There were a few moments in the movie in which I knew I was laughing at the awkwardness of this geeky kid, but more often, I knew that I was laughing at myself, at the awkwardness that I felt as  a kid. And who among us hasn't been morbidly embarrassed by our family members just as Napoleon is.	4.0	Geek Love	2005-02-11	2	2	0

First of all, people can RENT the movie and check it out for themselves, it's about $3 at the video store. Secondly, from my experience, I've actually found that the people I know who liked this movie are much more analytical and clever than the people who hated it. The people who hate this movie are quite simple minded and boring-the type that need to see blood, sex, and guns firing for them to be able to enjoy a movie.  The reason why this movie is so popular, is because most of us are sick of that genre of movies. I'm to the point where I pretty much only rent Indie films because Hollywood movies are so completely soul-less and predictable.

People with short attention spans who need fast-paced action to be stimulated will probably be disappointed with this flick.  Fans of independent films, who like something different and original, however, should love this one.Napoleon (John Heder) is a high school loser. Napoleon's brother spends most his hours looking for dates on the internet and his uncle, who is temporarily ""babysitting"" them, is mentally stuck in the year 1982, when he was a high school (or was it college) football star.Napoleon befriends a new student from Mexico, Pedro, and helps him campaign for student body president.  All the while he tries to build up the courage to ask one of his female classmates to the prom.That is the gist of the plot and it might not sound too exiting, but it is very entertaining and is all done with great acting and lots of humour.

That said, Napoleon wasnt a complete wash for me. There were moments i enjoyed, just not all of them like i kind of planned on.My main problem was with the muted tone that saturated almost every aspect of the movie. The main characters ALL had a very unexcited tone to their performance. Pedro especially annoyed me. Besides the occational ""GOSH!"" or something similar from Napoleon they stayed pretty subdued. There wasnt enough vareity in there for me. Put sleepy performances with the little to no plot this movie has and it was all just to downplayed for me.Like i said, there were moments i liked.

The more I watched it, the more I appreciated the comedy.Napoleon Dynamite, from Idaho, is possibly the goofiest character of all time, and not just because he's from Idaho.  The ginger kid afro, the incredibly stupid mouth-open grin, and the ridiculous clothing all make for a character at which I can't stop laughing.  ""Gosh!""Pedro is the perfect sidekick, barely there, barely audible, and barely normal.  Shaving his head, running for class president, baking cakes, and blasting pi&ntilde;atas, he's a hilarious mockery of many English as a second language immigrants.  ""It's a sledge hammer.""The other major characters (Deb, Uncle Rico, Skip, and even Summer) are perfect casting choices.  Deb is borderline retarded, and probably a little agoraphobic.  Uncle Rico is living the old days of high school, and he's beyond pathetic.  Skip is the biggest loser alive, with lame poetry, 4-hour chat sessions, and an internet ""girlfriend"".  Summer is perfect as the most popular girl in school who runs for class president because it's almost a guarantee that she'll win.Overall it's a great movie that will have you quoting lines in numerous situations on a daily basis.  Whether it's the steak throwing scene (that puts me in tears every time I see it) or the on-going obsession with self defense/cage fighting, you'll soon find yourself talking with friends about your favorite scenes.I can't recommend this movie highly enough."	5.0	Rewatchability: Infinity (Gosh!)	2006-07-18	8	6	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2WGHPROF2FAG2	"Jason J. Dupree ""jason3fc"""	"After seeing so many negative reviews, I had to chime in on this one. This isnt so much a review but a commentary on why or why not someone would love or hate this film.Napoleon Dynamite is not a ""fall on the floor laughing"" movie. In fact when I saw it I didnt quite look at it as a comedy at all but, just a commentary on life, and how one kid deals with life day to day. I'll have to say most people that probably love this movie were Napoleon or Deb to some extent. Those who werent, or who lived in a more city environment or who were the popular crowd, or jocks, just dont get this I'm sure. Thats not to say they are bad or any such thing, just that you have to have lived in some capacity as Napoleon to get the humor and the wonderful comment on society this film makes. With that in mind I have recommended it only to people who I knew were like that and would enjoy it, and once you sit and see it for what it is, it really is nostalgic.You see a regular guy trying to deal with reality with some fantasy escapism, but still taking care of everything he must do to get by in reality. Napoleon's sarcastic attitude to people is hilarious, and I remember having the same thing. I remember wearing helicopter t-shirts, and making boondoggles, and crappy school food, and having only one friend in junior high(because of transferring mid-junior high from another school, much like pedro) and just trying to make it and to be a friend to someone and to offer your ""skills"" whenever it was possible.If you walked this road in the late 80s - early 90s you will love this movie because it brings back all those possibly painful but great memories. It made me look back and reflect on what got me to where I am today, now married and in a successful career. It made me remember how I dealt with those awkward times growing up.Napoleon Dynamite is a fine movie, though not one I would consider a strict comedy. Call it a documentary in the life of awkward school kid nerdness, and how you can rise to a challenge.Believe it or not unlike most here, I didn't once find myself wondering why the movie lacked a plot.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2PIX2K56IZZYX	Jason W. Kaiser	Alot of people have told me they really can't stand this movie, but I don't get angry at them at all, this movie is not for everybody, in fact, it's for a select few. There are those of us who are just sick to death of big Hollywood romantic comedies......In this we get Napoleon and Deb, two kids who really dig each other (I think) but never hold hands, kiss, or anything, now how much of a nice change is that? no stupid fighting. no boring love scene, no dumb family banter, just two kids tryin' to make it through high school. Then there are also those of us who are sick of the big Hollywood comedies that are never as funny as advertised or previewed. In Napoleon we get hilarious lines and situations you would least expect and takes 2-3 viewings before you can catch all the jokes.I have seen this over 20 times (we watch it at work all the time) and I still stop what I'm doing several times to watch some of my favorite scenes. How about the big dance number towards the end? If you like this movie you know every time that comes on, you're gonna be watching every second of it. Then there is the school dance where Napoleon gets ditched by the popular girl, but does get to dance with Deb and tells her he likes her sleeves, cuz there poofy.Napoleon's best friend is a winner as well, Pedro runs for class president and actually wins thanks to Napoleon, but his best scene is where he organizes a picnic and they bash a pinata shaped like his opponents head (the most popular girl in school. Summer)All these actores are no-namers, but most will soon be huge, I've heard rumors that they might make a sequel, which would be great fun, hopefully all the cast will be back.You just gotta love Brother Kip and Uncle Rico, Kip is in love with his chat room buddy and Rico is a get-rich-quick schemer who is stuck in the 80's, so much that he orders a time machine that Napoleon unfortunately finds out the hard way that it does not work.Watch this people, alot of reviewers have dogged it big-time, but it's really funny, very charming and characters you're just going to love.acting........4 stars, Young cast is brilliantdirecting.....4.5 stars, So much out of so little.....special effects....N/A, Except for maybe Rico's time machine..lolcomedy rating....4 stars, Many laughs, some very, very funnyquality.......4 stars, Looks great, feels even better	4.0	I'll vote for Napoleon anyday...........	2005-11-16	6	3	3

Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	"I'd been hearing about Napoleon Dynamite for some time and finally at the urging of one of my friends, sat down and watched it. This film is definitely a sleeper, you will need to watch it multiple times to truly appreciate it. Jon Heder does a bang-up job as Napoleon Dynamite, a not so typical nerd. Napoleon lives with his brother and grandmother who is injured early on in the film during a ATV accident. Enter Uncle Rico who comes to look after the boys during his grandmothers absence. Uncle Rico is stuck in the year 1982 his football glory years and cannot get past the fact that he was on the bench during the State Championship. He's pretty much Matt Foley in other words he lives in a van down by the river. Napoleon and Uncle Rico clash from the get go to hilarious results. There are some side-splitting scenes including the time machine bit, throwing the button and Napoleon's lament over not having any skills that girls would find attractive (""I don't have any good skills...you know like nunchuck skills""). When a new student, Pedro Sanchez, enters the school, Napoleon befriends him and the rest is history. Not much happens during the running time of Napoleon Dynamite but ultimately I could not keep my eyes off it. Heder does such a fantastic job as the main character that we are left wanting to know more about him. The dance sketch following Pedro's speech was no less inspirational than Rocky taking Apollo Creed to the brink in the original. Napoleon Dynamite celebrates diversity and leaves the viewer with a great almost simplistic message...it's not what you look like on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside that counts.

Everyone, no matter how old you are or where you are from, can relate to the characters in this movie.  Also, another thing I've noticed about this movie is that people either love it or they hate it.  I can remember the first time I watched it.  I think we replayed several scenes multiple times due to how funny they were.  Some of the things that Napoleon does are so incredibly stupid that they are hilarious.  Napoleon and his older brother Kip are loners who don't have many if any friends.  Napoleon is a high school student trying to fit in while Kip stays at home and carries out an odd relationship with an internet chat partner whom he has never met.  Eventually they both find love but what's funny is the road they take to get there.  The music in this movie even made me laugh.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is so hilariously sweet that I can't get enough of it. Destined to become a classic, ND's lines, characters and scenes are already being burned into memory by fans - a ""buyer"" (not a ""renter"") if ever there was one.The film assembles a cast of the weirdest, most engaging characters seen on screen in many a day. ND follows the crazy/ordinary life of Napoleon Dynamite, high school giga-nerd, his scrawny older brother Kip, 1982-obsessed Uncle Rico, uptight girlfriend Deb, dim-bulb-yet-ambitious Pedro and a host of other misfit types who should be familiar to anyone who has endured the American school scene. Set in rural Idaho, there's no particular plot other than getting through the school day, fending off jocks and beauty queens, trying to get a tetherball partner and attempting sweet jumps on bikes. Along the way, the film provided dead-on satires of martial arts commercials, school elections, wild grandmas, glamour photography and the inanities of life itself.Napoleon (Jonn Heder) is a frizzy-haired, bespectacled beanpole who is unpopular but doesn't care. He spends his school day drawing magical animals, yearning for a ""skill"" and ludicrously lying about his dangerousness to others who know better. Heder perfectly captures the type: prickly toward all those who threaten or annoy him (including grade-schoolers), never making eye-contact, mouth always agape, unathletic and uncoordinated. His unironic delivery of exclamations like ""Idiot!"" and ""Whatever I want! Gosh!"" and ""Lucky!"" (this delivered when an unlikely character lands an outlandishly sexy ""soulmate"") are quickly becoming classic.

Jon Heder is perfect as Napoleon and his friends and family are priceless. Even the high school queen bees and jocks aren't all that mean.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AONIWBNF5PES2	"Jeff-Bob ""Jeff"""	"It's Napoleon's world and we're just living in it.  From the brilliant opening credits by the legendary 70-year-old title designer Pedro Ferro (""Dr. Strangelove, Stop Making Sense, Men in Black"") to the ending disco beat of ""The Promise"" by 'When in Rome', Jared Hess constructs a true-to-life vision of his hometown Preston, Idaho that had me rolling in on the floor, falling in love with characters that I would never go near in real life. Jon Heder (who is clearly too old to play the title character) lets nothing stand in his way of creating the ultimate nerd. With Pedro at his side (Efren Ramirez) the two get mocked, humiliated and asswhupped until the final amazing cathartic ending that shows the small joys of friendship and affection. Jon Gries (from 'Get Shorty') as Uncle Rico is a scream as over the hill jock and coniving tupperware salesman. DVD transfer is quite good and the deleted scenes are awesome.  Commentary by the director and Heder however make you realize how young these guys are.  I knew something was up when Dennis Quaid showed up on the Daily Show wearing a ""Vote 4 Pedro"" t-shirt.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	In the wake of independent pictures and original films, this seems to be one of the prized selections in those categories. Last night, I had the pleasure of seeing what I consider one of the funniest and most interesting film I've seen in awhile.Dynamite is one weird kid. He has the most eccentric, odd, loser family in Idaho and he dons odd clothing, hairstyles, and participates in random, mundane activities. But, that's what makes him interesting, what makes the film interesting. As we follow him, from his ventures with his brother into joining a karate, defense class labeled, 'Rex Kwan Do', to a day of school where the kids are just as dated as he is, we meet and see more of the dynamic world.Imagine a world today, that wasn't in today's standards and culture. A place where the music is of the 80's and the people are stuck in the fashion and lifestyles of the 70's. Odd doesn't describe this, but hilariously distinguished might. It's not that funny that you sit there and laugh out loud or kick the chair hysterically; it's just there, and laugh if you may. Although there are scenarios everyone is bound to laugh, but for the most part, its open minded humor.See the film.  I had approached this film skeptically, not being sure how I would react or relate to it...but it won me over. It was not just another dumb comedy that would disintegrate two points off my intelligence quotient just by sitting through it. Rather, it was a fine little film, large on ambition, that I came to care about. I recommend it highly.	4.0	The comedy is dry, bland, and stale......... But, it works.	2006-02-08	5	4	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A11423AYVMMC4K	"Jeremy G. Snyder ""Darkstalker"""	There were a few cute moments in this movie to be fair.  The dance at the end (which was a bit cheesy, but cool and sweet also since he was helping out his friend).  For the most part however, this movie was a complete waste of time.  Keep in mind that I'm someone who would kill to star in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie and count Empire of the Sun and Magnolia as two of my favorite ever movies, right alongside The Shawshank Redemption.  I also have six DVD's of the best of Beavis and Butthead also and the Collector's Edition of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, so you can't say that I don't appreciate dead-pan comedy.  But those works still have some art and love in them and perfect delivery combined with actual PLOTS and PUNCHLINES.  This movie was just plain dry almost all the way through.  The one-liners were lame and monotonous.  There was no plot or point to this whole movie.  You can see that I need to appreciate on a subtle level, which there was none of.  Or maybe I'm just looking for some actual action, drama, or comedy.  I don't know about you, but that's certainly what I watch movies for.  I think the only real reason that this movie was successful was because it was promoted by MTV, yet was so different from what they usually promote.  Hell, if you want good comedy from MTV, watch Orange County.  This was just sad however.  Save your money and go see The Aviator or Ray instead.	2.0	Makes most Reality T.V. seem profound	2005-02-17	6	2	4
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3RTX9SNUXNEER	"Jeremy J. Parker ""Jack Shoegazer"""	"It is official. I have watched Napoleon Dynamite. I put it off as long as I could because I was afraid. Yes, afraid. I didn't want to know if I was the kind of person who likes Napoleon Dynamite.When this film debuted, some of my closest friends told me it was an amazing film, hilarious, and even quite possibly the best movie ever. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions.However, there was a contingent group who hated it. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions. Their loathing was only matched by the previous group's love for it.Napoleon yin to Dynamite yang.The media said this. Professional movie reviewers said this. Complete strangers I harassed on the bus said this. Just kidding, I don't ride the bus. But complete strangers did come to the same conclusions about this film.Napoleon Dynamite is either the best or the worst film ever made.Suddenly, the world is thrown into sharp contrast. There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love it and those who hate it. I didn't want to know what kind of person I was, if I was a lover or a hater. What would it say about who I am and the structure of my personality and my taste in films and comedy? Which ever would I be? Let the spinning of the Tao commence!I've now seen it three times. Upon the first viewing, I kept waiting for the punch line. I kept waiting to laugh. It felt like it was a constant set-up with no payoff. (However, the introductory credits were clever and exciting.) It left me feeling blah.Upon the second viewing, for some reason, I started to giggle more. I paid more attention to the details. I submitted myself to that world. Napoleon's whiny GHAWD seemed less grating. Pedro was suddenly hilarious. And damn, I want that suit.By the third viewing, I think I figured it out. It's not a constant set up and no punch lines. It's all punch line. That's why it's one of the most quoted movies right now. Every phrase is a one-liner with a subtle punch. I bet the French love that movie. The background, the sets and clothes, the top-loading VCRs, the god-almighty moon boots, the ambiance is the set up for this film. At first I balked over the seeming lack of plot, but the more I've seen it, the less it matters. The wedding is the best part. ""Sorry I'm late. I just got done taming a wild honeymoon stallion for you guys."" Salvador Dali would be proud.So, what can I say, I liked it. Eventually. It grew on me like an overzealous mole. Like a chia pet. Like bacteria on a forming brick of bleu cheese. The only problem now is that I have a nine-year-old running around occasionally belting out an exasperated whine of, ""I told you! I spent the summer with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines!""This concludes another edition of Jeremy's Movie Review. I hereby award this movie with 11 pink armadillos, a liger, and a catastrophic plot device."	5.0	The movie you have to see three times...	2006-01-26	5	4	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1IBSQQHGCDUAN	"Jeremy Ulrey ""Bangyrmfhead"""	"Christ, it's hard to spell out what makes ""Napolean Dynamite"" a great film as so many of it's successes are on a visual scale, but here goes:First of all, several reviewers have attempted to justify Napolean and the other characters as being likable on some level. It's my contention that for a movie to work the primary characters don't have to be likable, just interesting: you could make an entire Star Wars trilogy with Darth Vader as the main character and people would still eat that sh*t up. Napolean is definitely not likable in the sense that you would have wanted him as a playground chum in high school, and neither are most of the characters likable in this sense, but herein lies the genius of the movie: you can watch all these amusingly annoying characters from a distance without the burden of having to interact with them in real life. Everyone out there had someone in school who they thought were interesting in one regard or another, but refused to hang out with them because the other 90% of their personality was out of whack, and it's the same principle with watching Napolean.John Heder's characterization of Napolean has to be commended first and foremost. We're never required to feel sorry for Napolean because he never seems to care too much what anyone thinks; life is merely an endless series of inconveniences rather than humiliations. Perhaps it's this lack of need for empathy that leads some reviewers to dismiss the quality of the film, but personally I feel that a viewer who can only get something out of a movie if he/she can directly relate the characters and events in the movie to their own life is missing out on much, not only in the realm of cinema but most likely the lessons of life in general.If anyone is even more of a geek than Napolean it's his brother Kip, who talks with an effeminate lisp and, at the age of 32, is apparently content to live with his Grandma and talk in chatrooms all day. At this it should be mentioned that the chronology of the film is somewhat confusing: 90% of the visual and plot cues would lead one to believe the films takes place in the 80s -- most of the soundtrack music is from the 80s, Napolean's wardrobe is definitely old school, and the appearance and mannerisms of the auxiliary characters have much in common with teen flicks of the 80s as well -- but here and there are sprinkled references that are decidedly 90s in character -- Kip's use of the internet to hook up with his ""soul mate"", for instance, as well as a few other key soundtrack tunes. This isn't a crippling defect, however; there is little about ""Napolean Dynamite"" that strives to be a period piece, and if anything the out-of-touch world of his Idaho surroundings portray an existence that time has, for the most part, simply passed by.Of course, all of this would mean little if the characters were merely left to compete for laughs, but what makes ""Napolean Dynamite"" work is it's perceptiveness. Yes, many of the characters are stereotypes in a fashion, but high school hallways are filled with stereotypes yet to be fleshed out into distinct human beings, and neither is there an adolescent stereotype omitted nor a false interaction between any of them. All of the characters behave toward each other exactly as you'd expect them to, although it must be said Napolean and the rest of the ""geeks"" operate on a slightly more unpredictable scale, largely because they are outcasts living in other peoples' world, and it's not their place to shape events but to react to them. The way that Napolean, Pedro, Deb and even Uncle Rico and Kip adapt to their surroundings may not always seem common, but to the extent that their personalities are developed there is never a false movie between them. The film is mostly episodic, necessarily so as it sets up various scenarios and steps back while it's characters react to them, but as there are no dull moments to wade through ""Napolean Dynamite"" can only be considered a major ""flippin'"" success."	5.0	Understated classic	2005-09-29	1	0	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2F28HCA26QVIP	J. Gallimore	Frankly, Napoleon Dynamite is probably one of my favorite movies to have been released last year.  While this movie does not seem to appeal to the type of crowd that doesn't appreciate obscurity, anyone else can't help but laugh at the antics of this odd teen from Preston, Idaho.  The movie is nothing more than a look into Napoleon's awkward life, so if you're looking for a deep, engrossing movie, you might want to look elsewhere.  Every character in this movie is memorable in my mind, whether it be Napoleon with his taste for drawing fantasy figures or Uncle Rico with his apparent desire to go back to a simpler time (that time being the 80's).  Simply put, this movie is hilarious thoughout, a shear pleasure to watch.  The fact that it is free of any sort of obscenity or profanity is refreshing in a time when no good movie is capable of getting anything less than a PG-13 rating.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this movie (I would suggest passing on the soundtrack, soundbytes from the movie are of very little interest).	5.0	Adolescent delight	2005-01-21	3	1	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2OCW6Y15CF40	J. Gayle	"Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies you either get or you don't.Some people will laugh because they think the characters are pathetic and stupid and, well...it's fun to laugh at people so we can feel better about ourselves, isn't it? For people like that, it is probably important to pay attention to Don, the ""cool"" guy at Preston High who laughs incredulously at Napoleon and his friends...but who is also unaware that he's the most pathetic character in the film.Anyway, I think the genius of this movie is partly in its deadly accurate portrayal of small-town American life for teenagers. I grew up in rural Maine (another potato farming state) and I identified very strongly with many of the seemingly absurd situations in the movie...the wacky characters are not so wacky, really. The way some shots are set up say so much about what a struggle it can be to fit in in a place where the both minds and cliques are pretty closed.Most of the movie's charm is in its examination of the power of true friendship. Anyone who doesn't think there is a deeper meaning to this somewhat pointless, plotless, random collection of bizarre situations doesn't understand what it means to be willing to do anything for people you care about.In the end, this is a highly original movie(with a very good soundtrack)that will be enjoyed by the Dons of the world who like to laugh at the geeks (unfortunately) and enjoyed more by those who can see pieces of their own humanity in Napoleon and his family and friends."	4.0	You get it or you dont.	2009-07-05	8	8	0

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AWPALDK2S4MFV	Jiffy	Napoleon Dynamite has been one of the better films of 2004. Then again, 2004 was a pretty lousy year for movies (seeing the only REAL good ones were Dodgeball, Harold and Kumar, Anchorman and Napoleon Dynamite). The film is a bunch of one liners, which is good in this movies case. The movie has virtually no plot- Not true. There is a tiny subplot to the plot that does not exist. Napoleon's friend, Pedro (only kid in school with a 'stache') is running for school president. Anyway, it is also good that there is a lack of plot because if you were to walk in on it 10 minutes before it ended, you would know as much about it as the people who have been watching from the beginning.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2ZX6GW8WL5AG3	jimmy_rants@yahoo	I wanted to dislike this movie so bad, but I can't. It is a colorful, lighthearted tale of clueless class bozo Napoleon and his adolescent tribulations- attempting romance and supporting his equally weird friend Pedro.Idaho, the films location is a beautiful state and appears almost surreal as a backdrop to the sufferable antics of Napoleon, his geek brother and scheming uncle as they try to live under the same roof when Napoleons guardian is temporarily hospitalized. The film is so light hearted that  it challenges our own minds in what to expect next, in many instances I found myself misinterpreting the intentions of the strange group of characters, usually they ended up being far better people than I expected.Jon Heder might have drained his whole talent pool on this, I will find it hard to see him as anyone but this well put together title role. Tina Majorina is great as one of the group of kids you can't help but want to laugh at sometimes, but shines like the sun and shows so much heart it's hard not to love.	5.0	Funny,Touching,STRANGE	2007-09-27	2	2	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	I never really expected to like this film. But after seeing it on Cinamax, I was surprised that I loved it. The movie is pretty pointless but it's still pretty funny and often even heart-felt. Roger Ebert claimed that the movie made no attempt to make Napoleon likeable. Well that's totally wrong. He can be a jerk but he also does some good things in the movie. When a kid gets bullied and picked on in school, he offers him protection from his friend Padro's big cousins. When Padro is running for president and doesn't know he's supposed to do a dance number. Napoleon dances for the audience instead. So what's not likeable about that. If he wasn't likeable then why would so many people love this movie and love the character.What makes the movie pointless is that it just ends basically and basically just lives with no plot. His annoying uncle moves in after Napoleon's Grandma has an accident. He hands out flyers to women telling them he can help them get bigger boobs. Which makes people laugh at Napoleon more than they do already. So he wants to get rid of his uncle but he won't leave. Does his uncle ever actually leave ? I'm not even sure. But I can forgive a movie this fun and a hilarious for not really leading anywhere. All the characters are original and funny and they're well played by the actors as well. The best scene is when Napoleon and his brother think they actually own a time machine that will send them back to the past. They just casually try it out like owning a time machine would be normal or possible. I also like the scene where his uncle shows off his throwing arm by hitting Napoleon in the head with a rock lol.	4.0	Pointless but  a funny good time.	2005-08-28	4	2	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AUWV5NQVFEPW3	"J. Jackson ""climaction"""	"On alternate sites, I've read great and lousy reviews of this movie.  The reviewers who panned it simply don't get it.  This film takes an eyes wide open (unlike Napoleon) view of high school nerdiness and alienation.  I know kids like Napoleon and it's about time they were presented in an unsanitized way, in full, naturally comedic splendor.  ""Napoleon Dynamite"" doesn't look down at these characters, nor does Napoleon have an insider's insight to Columbine, as one reviewer suggested.  It unapologetically presents the characters in an only slightly exagerrated way.  The story (what there is of it) is as existential as the backdrop of Preston High School, Idaho.One other note -- I've read several times that the setting for the movie is vaguely the 1980's.  That is clearly not the case, despite the use of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time after Time"" and other music.  For one thing, Kip's internet chatting and Uncle Rico's online purchase of a time machine would have been unheard of until the 90's.  Instead, the movie is set in a vaguely 90s to present day period, with the characters hopelessly stuck in a ""time warp"" -- again, played for comedic purposes.  Also, Rico repeatedly refers to his football glory days of 1982.  His character is easily in his mid to late 30s.My son explains that this is a movie you have to see more than once to ""get"".  I didn't experience gut-busting laughs during my time in the theatre, but when my son said ""Your mom goes to college!"" on the way home, I began to understand the inexplicable humor I'd just witnessed.  4.5 stars!"	4.0	Flippin' awesome!	2004-12-23	12	8	4

Grab some ice cream, grab a comfy chair and wack in the DVD.What can I say, there is absolutely nothing funny about this particular movie (Tell a lie, there is one scene that almost got a smile out of me when Pedro smiles towards the end...possably becuase it is the only emotion that looks genuine) least in so far as I am concerned. Apparently there are people out there who enjoyed it (And yes you may be such a person) but for myself, the humour value just didn't exist.So to be fair, who is most likely going to enjoy this movie? That's a hard question to answer becuase I missed the point of it all, based on the type of person who I have spoken to who did get a kick out of it, it appears that those who belittle Hollywood (Such would include people who prefer the original foreign produced film over the Hollywood remakes of such films for no other reason than it wasn't produced by Hollywood), who believe in the good fight against commercialism (the fact that there are vote for Pedro t-shirts available leaves me wondering though) and that no independant film can do any wrong would be the key audience that would find this particular movie enjoyable (Rise up and rebel against the mainstream). Perhaps my enjoyment of this movie was dampened by the fact that I do not view myself as elitest with a need to prove my intellectual superiority or perhaps it is due to my wide ranging enjoyment of movies (Yes...I watch most films that hit the cinemas were I am, many of which are bad (Ugh...only thing worse is seeing a bad movie in a bad cinema that smells), some that are good and I have been doing so a few decades now so yes, perhaps I am just jaded).If your aged 10-16 (Which fits the age group of the majority of viewers who said to me it was funny), chances are you may like it as you sympathise with Napoleon Dynamite and his dreary life. Fans over this age bracket seem to be more in line with the anti-hollywood crowd, many of which took great pleasure in pointing out that fact.If you don't like deadpan humour (chances are you wont even spot the humour if this is the case), this film is a definite miss.If you think your smarter than the average Joe, then hey, maybe you will get something I certainly didn't and you'll love this movie.	1.0	Deadpan humour?

He says, ""this is, like, the worst video ever"". That, my friends, is the sweet embodiment of irony. You see, at worst, anything else could only possibly be the second worst video ever. That particular low bar has been set by the very film that contains the line, and it's not likely to be displaced by anything. Ever.Maybe I just don't get it.

There's not a single likable character in Napoleon Dynamite to be found, however, if you like dwarf tossing you might 'enjoy' this unimaginative gob of drek.After having read the panyegric online reviews, I watched this (thankfully rented) indie 'movie' through to the bitter finale.  The main characters are the kind of geeks that even nerds and other losers can't stand.  Ever wondered why a pack of dogs will kill one of their own; after watching Napoleon Dynamite, you won't wonder again...Then, after a long boring hour establishing the absolute nadir of these geeks' lives in excruciating detail, the movie gets stupid.  The ending absolutley destroys whatever cinema verite it previously and painfully established.  One geek' meets his penpal hottie who then magically (I asume) turns this pitiful wretch into a hip-hop dude!  Oh yeah, that's believable; only to someone who still watches Saturday morning cartoons, cereal commercials for fun and American Idol...If that isn't unbelievable enough, Napoleon (who can't scale a fence without falling on his face) then -- after watching some lame dance video -- turns into a nerdy Michael Jackson...

Yes, it was quirky but was it likable?  Not really.  Oddball outcast Napoleon Dynamite struggles in a world he never made, while is simpering brother and nostalgia ridden hairpiece of an uncle provide backup fodder.  Character development was minute to non-existant.  Granted, Napoleon and brother `came out' of their shells, but we are left wondering about the rest of this odd Idaho world.  Uncle Rico while at times amusing should have stayed in the basement of Real Genius.  The lead is simply not very compelling and a bit too force clich&eacute;d for those of us who did our high school time in the 80's.

On the surface, Napoleon Dynamite is a silly high-school farce filled with two-dimensional cartoon characters. But its appeal surpasses. While no ""Citizen Kane"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (hence my four stars,) it is nothing less than a brilliant example of how detached humans can be from the reality of the world around them. Those who think they are in the know, such as the adult high-school kid Uncle Rico, or the ""hot chick"" Trisha, are illustrations of individuals still clearly detached from human emotions; therefore, they do not ""get it."" They have created a ""here-ness"" based on external influences, not internal values.Meanwhile, the dorky Napoleon struggles to understand his place in a reality that is perplexing and most rewarding when fantastical. He clearly has developed values ""Plus you're like the only guy at school who has a mustache,"" but he struggles to understand his place in the featureless Idaho pastureland, his only real world. It is a world largely devoid of external stimulation so he escapes into his world of Ligers. It is a world largely devoid of emotion let alone God, with one exception, the wondrous coupling of Napoleon's brother Kip and his on-line fling Lafawnduh. In them, we see even when detached in the real world, love can grow when itself is real.At it's climax, Napoleon finds self-developmental breakthrough in creative expression, shocking those who did not ""get it"" and winning the admiration of those who do.I recommend Napoleon Dynamite.

It's basically follows the model of dozens of nerd wish fulfillment movies and TV shows, to the point of parody. It works because of its unique rhythm, odd characters, constant surprises, funny deadpan dialogue, inventive sight gags, and outrageous performances.  Napoleon is a nerd, but he's a stalwart nerd who basically doesn't want to change any more than is absolutely necessary.  He's stoically willing to pay the price, and he spends half his time dealing with people who are even stranger than himself--especially equally out-of-it brother and his smarmy uncle. Kip Dynamite, the older brother, looks like Wally Cox on the Atkins plan.  The uncle is Napoleon's true nemesis, a pathetically overconfident salesman of products that nobody wants.The story pivots around two events:  Napoleon's realization that to win the girl he seems, ambivalently, to want, he needs ""skills""; and the arrival of Kip's girlfriend, a woman he met in an internet chat room. Shortly after her hilarious arrival, and her transformation of Kip into a mutant hip-hopper, she hands Napoleon a crucial gift.  The result is a huge comic payoff that, on reflection, makes no sense, but is such a bizarre and hilarious surprise, you buy it because it's too good to question.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AQ79DO3H5GRS2	John Wykes	Napoleon Dynamite is one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last few years.  Its very deadpan humor might rub some people the wrong way -- but for me and for many, the humor hits the bullseye.  Napoleon is a nerd who hits the pinnacle of nerdiness and yet seems to exude a common sense sadly lacking in his brother and his uncle.  His classmates are all easily recognizable for us all because they bear such a close resemblance to reality.  I think just about everyone has had a Pedro, a Napoleon, and a Summer in their past.  The film is funny because the characters are real.  The barebones and almost plotless story is hilarious because it, too, is real.In a tongue and cheek sort of way, Napoleon and his friends are elevated, in a certain sense, to a new level of respectability.  Without giving away the plot, we are are rooting for Pedro and happy for Napoleon.  Nerdy beyond nerdiness, ordinary beyond ordinariness, both characters win our hearts because they don't seem to be actors in the latest comedy film.  They seem to be real people.Best of all, the film keeps any crude humor to the bare minimum.  Instead, it finds its humor in the bizarre happenings of everyday life.  It is genuinely funny in its own right -- a rarity these days.Those who are looking for arthouse cinema, as some other reviewers have, are looking in the wrong place.  I'm a big fan of some great filmmakers, including Ozu, Kurosawa, and Satyjit Ray, but this film is not meant to be high art.  Instead, it is a comedy piece that is fresh, original, and sure to be a cult classic.  Enjoy	4.0	Original, Funny, and a Cult Classic	2004-12-28	7	5	2

He's got a crazy motorcycle riding grandma, a web-chatting brother, an Uncle obsessed with 1982, and a Hispanic friend running for Student body president. The only time Dynamite uses any skill at all is his dancing skit which was quite good considering what the heck he was doing.Thisis a movie you may or may not watch once a year, and when it's over, you'll just scratch your head and realize anyone could make a movie, if this project actually saw the light of day.	3.0	I guess I just didn't get it.	2005-03-22	6	0	6
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"4.5 stars.Well, once again I find myself asking: Has Roger Ebert lost his mind? He gave this film one and a half stars. That is, frankly, inane. He makes a comparison between this film and films with Adam Sandler, saying that you like an Adam Sandler film because Adam Sandler is in the film, and this is the type of film that falls into that category.Wow. Was he on drugs?He has certainly lost whatever edge he had when Gene Siskel passed away, and that's seen in so, so many films that he has reviewed since that sad day. I can't help but think that if ""Siskel and Ebert"" was still a show, if Siskel was still alive, that Ebert would have realized that this film isn't simply a stupid film about a character we're not supposed to like.OK. Is Napoleon Dynamite a character we're supposed to like or relate to? If you've ever been in high school, which most of us have, we have seen a character like Napoleon Dynamite. He is absolutely clueless, is a ""nerd"" to the thousandth degree - but that's why we like him! If we're still in high school, then perhaps we would laugh at him and think it's not only funny, but appropriate, for him to be picked on and teased by his peers. However, most of us are out of high school, and most of us - if we have any sense of moral decency - regret that we ever made fun of or picked on anyone like Napoleon. To me, THAT is part of what this film is about. His ""victory"" at the end is not something to be mocked. It's more of a victory that would probably come years down the road - but that wasn't the nature of this film, so they showed us that victory in a somewhat shortened sense.One of the most memorable lines in the film to me was Napoleon's comment that (and this may be paraphrased) ""girls like guys who have skills"". Was that not true in high school? Of course it was! I know many girls that I went to high school with that deeply regret the indifference they showed to people like Napoleon. I myself, while not being a ""jock stud"" feel awful when I think of the people that I completely neglected or poked fun at people like Napoleon. Heck, to some people, I was Napoleon. This was very gutsy and accurate portrayal of high school.So what's wrong with a film where the ""nerd"" comes out on top? Absolutely nothing.And what's wrong if we laugh along the way? The humor was so subtle, not side-splitting laughter, but it was there. And that was the essence of the film: subtlety. It wasn't going out of its way to make you laugh, to try and make you feel sorry for Napoleon - it was simply demonstrating a particular existence. And it was done remarkably well. And it gave you several laughs along the way.All of the actors fit their roles perfectly - again with the same subtlety. If you want Adam Sandler, this isn't the film for you, and Ebert was really off base when he drew that comparison."	4.0	I didn't write this review before looking at the others.....	2005-02-12	4	2	2

Reinhart ""The Raven Strikes Again"""	"This is in the tradition of indie greats Kevin Smith's Clerks and Richard Linklater's Slackers.I saw this film in the local community theatre when it first debuted and I received it today from my friend Paul for my birthday, in addition to Katamari Damacy for PS2, and this film completely blows my socks off. The film is Napoleon Dynamite, an indie film by brothers Jared and Jerusha Hess, both Mormons, that is constantly hilarious without resorting to ""dick and fart jokes."" The film is also one for the kids as the closest to swearing is when a character, usually Napoleon, says ""Gosh!"" or ""Dang!"" Not only is the film hilarious but it tackles many important issues that lie just beneath the film's surface. The issue of economic wealth, racial harmony/disharmony, social and class harmony/disharmony, and rural American life.My friends and I laughed throughout the entire film at the community theatre in a nonstop laughfest. Tonight was a repeat, albeit solo, laughfest. The film, lasting nearly 90 minutes, is a joy to watch and it is no wonder that it was a nominee for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.This ranks near the top of my list of favored films with 5 stars."	5.0	This is in the tradition of indie greats Smith & Linklater	2004-12-27	6	6	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2PLA2SFJE5UZ6	Jonathan W. Williams	First of all everyone who gave this five stars where correct, I am just putting in my two cents, I concur...You can stop reading now... The only bitter feelings this movie has provoked is the fact that my sister Cait did not buy me the DVD for Christmas! The same girl I raised, pretty much single handed! I sang Don McClain (sp) songs to her while I changed her fouled diapers,put warm water on her meat gravey flavored chow(softens the nuggets) and routinely fished her out of the mud hole we rode our dirt bikes through, heck I'm the one who put the carp in there so she would have someone to play with.  If you did continue to read when I suggested you stop understand this is all based on fact. Including this gem,Elvis Costello in the 1980s  declared that he would no longer be known as Elvis Costello, but instead as Napoleon Dynamite, under which name he released what may have been his last great album, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE.In addition to this gem, I copied this fact from a better reviewer than myself.

So many people recommended this movie to me, so i finally rented it.  Everyone said this movie is full of ""dry, sarcastic humor,"" which i love.  However, this movie had NOTHING LIKE THAT AT ALL.  This was one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life.  It's so bad i don't even know what to say.  There are literally about 2 funny parts in the entire movie, and they are barely funny enough to elicit a chuckle.  The movie is sooo slow.  There were probably 7 or 9 scenes in the movie where at the end of them, i just wanted to scream out ""WHAT THE #@$*%@ WAS THAT?!?!""  One example would be a scene that is about a minute or two long that consists of napoleon sitting in a truck waiting for his uncle.  He looks at his watch.  Then they show the truck for about 10 seconds.  Then they show napoleon's goofy face.  Then they show the inside of the truck for a while.  Then he looks at his watch again.  This goes on, in complete silence, for way too long, and there are so many pointless ""filler"" scenes in this movie that i started to think the entire movie was pointless filler.  Then i realized that it was.  I actually fell asleep about 1 hour 10 minutes into the movie, and i wasn't even tired, i think it was my body's way of shutting down to keep me from seeing anymore of this awful movie.  I woke up about 10 minutes later with plenty of time to catch the worthless corny ending.Napoleon is an awkward nerdy kid that has the typical ""duh, of course i knew that, you idiot"" adolescent attitude.  The entire movie consists of him making comments with as much or less substance than the one i just created to describe him, and these are supposed to be the funny parts.  Literally, that's all you get.  He doesn't have many friends at school, he befriends a mexican student, and he has a weird uncle that sells tupperware and an older brother that has an online girlfriend.  The mexican student ends up running for class president.  The hilarity ensues.Seriously, I am at a loss as to why so many people think this movie is funny.  It probably has something to do with the fact that there hasn't been a decent comedy movie written in years.  I lost respect for a lot of friends' taste in movies after seeing this.  As for the amazon rating, maybe all the people reviewing it are MTV reps.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.  If you happen to be unfortunate enough to watch it, then do amazon a favor and come back and give it an honest review."	1.0	Painfully bad movie.	2005-01-04	36	13	23

But you can tell it was done by the original MTV Generation cuz this Napolean was based on nerds in the 80's.  And that is when this movie takes place.  Why in the 80's?Acting was bad, almost every person in this movie had a self pity all over the place.  Almost everyone was the same character.  Tater Tots in jeans?

One thing I didn't like was the guy who played Napoleon's brother Kip. The actor just pissed me off. Anyway, Jon Heder plays Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon is a tad bit socially challenged and lives with his grandma and brother Kip.When his grandma is injured in a motorcycling accident his scheming Uncle Rico moves in. This is a sub plot really, but it spawns some of the funniest jokes in the movie.But anyway, at school he makes friends with Pedro, who later runs for president. This movie actually is pretty stupid. But it's funny and at times heartfelt. It is also annoying to me being from California. There are frequent uses of ""Idaho"" words. Like referring to soda as ""pop"". Pop is a sound, not a liquid.

I'll be the first to admit that the Napoleon Dynamite quoting craze is getting a bit ridiculous, but why not, there are more classic quotes in this movie then one mind could possibly think of. I've read alot of the negative reviews for this movie and I totally understand most of them. ND is not for everyone. Especially if you need comedy shoved down your throat. It moves quite slow and has no real plot at all but taht is also what makes this movie great. Its like no other comedy that has ever come out.The characters first of all is what makes this movie great. All i was thinking the first time i saw this movie was Where in the hell did they find the actors to play these characters? Every character is so funny in their own way it's hard to choose a favorite. My personal favorite is Lyle, the old Idaho farmer. The script of this movie and the way the lines are delivered from the actors is also esquisite. This movie are contains alot of physical comedy taht makes it great.  Deb runnign across the yard, Uncle rico making videos of himself, napoleon all sweaty drinking the energy drink, napoleon taking the VOTE FOR SUMMER button and chucking it down the hall, the principal bobbing his head during Summer's skit, the stupid look on coolguy Don's face the whole movie, ND flapping his hands during the Happy Hands Club presentation etc. the list goes on and on. I also love how the story all pulls together in the end with napoleon learning to dance then using his ""skills"" to help Pedro win the election and then Napoleon finally finding someone to play tetherball with him. And the dance scene i think will go down in history as an alltime classic scene. What alos made that scene enjoyable is if a nerd like ND would have danced like that at my  high school we would have given him the same standing ovation.The music in the movie also pulls it together quite well. The cyndi lauper song at the school dance scene is awesome and so is the acoustic song after the ND dance scene. My favorite though is the song played at the end when ND and Deb are playing tetherball. Kip's song after the credits is awesome Too.All in all Napoleon Dynamite really is a hero taht is hard not to fall in love with.""You got like three feet of air that time."""	5.0	Do the chickens have large talons?	2005-01-22	5	4	1

There is, however, an earnest sincerity about the picture, and its tone and set of messages hit the bull's-eye when it comes to speaking some deep emotional truths.

Maybe the fact that they feel constrained from laughing reveals a deep sense of superiority to the world portrayed in this wonderful film. Why is it that some say we should not laugh at others? Is it bcause they laugh out of derision while others laugh out of self-recognition, sympathy and a good dose of irony? I laughed or smiled through this entire film. The only people I felt deserved derision were the bullies and the self absorbed adults. The bizarre take on the nature of romance that permeates this film is wonderful and offers some truly hilarious moments as well as some very touching, heart warming ones. The technical qualities of this film are superb and really helps to create a picture postcard flatness that enhances the surreal, almost David Lynch like pace and nature of the film. Unless a viewer is harboring deep seated and repressed animosity to this world or thinks that every movie that pokes fun at the soft underside of the belly of America is being cruel,everyone should be able to watch and enjoy this unique piece of American cinema.	5.0	SO BADLY MISUNDERSTOOD	2005-10-16	6	4	2

First of all, I was skeptical about watching a movie (especially a comedy) with a ""PG"" rating; this rating struck me as representative of a ""children's comedy"" which, if anybody agree's, are typically underachieving, and undisputedly appropriate for the audience which the rating merits. Myself knowing a few of the ""nerds"" during high school, this movie acts as a magnification of reality, but in a way that doesn't seem too overbearing. I would like to go over a few of the elements which I thought maximized the overall motif that the movie was aiming to create: that theme being, perhaps, a mixture of ""nice guys finish last"" and ""save the world, lose the girl"" (Napolean saves his metaphorical world without actually losing his flame ""deb"")First of all, the perpetuation of Napolean as a stereotypical nerd is a reoccuring element throughout the course of the film. Everybody remembers their high school years with the ""nerds""; the implicit construction of Napolean Dynamite as a nerd is by no means conventional. Napolean doesn't need a keyboard and a computer screen to be a nerd. So, if you are expecting a reincarnation of ""Revenge of the Nerds"", don't be too surprised when viewing ""Napolean Dynamite"" when quite the opposite is true.Second of all, the Characters surrounding Napolean Dynamite are all basically characterized in the same way that Napolean is. This is what perhaps adds a little more humor to the movie. Some of the other ""Peeps"" (not a term actually used in the movie, but somewhat relevant to Napolean's colloquial context) that add the most humor to the film are: Napolean's ""sidekick"" Pedro, Napolean's unconscious crush Deb, and his (much) older brother Kip. All of these characters have their own little quirks that just seem to place them apart from the crowed and label them as ""nerds"". My personal favorites were Kip and Pedro. Pedro is so monotanous that he almost begs to audience to put words in his mouth. What was somewhat ironic to me was that he was initially built up as a character who doesn't seem to have very many interests and who appears to be a recluse. However, he quickly turns around and wants to become the class president by the middle of the movie. Kind of a bizarre twist of events and mentalities if you ask me. But then again, this movie didn't make the kind of money it did for it's lack of plot. Which leads me to my next point.This movie has little to no plot. Don't get too excited Seinfeld fans; this movie has a somewhat weakened plot which is organized just enough so that the viewer doesn't feel the need to turn it off about 5 minutes into it. When I was watching the DVD's extra features, there were a few scenes that were deleted and the express reason (at least what the director's commentary stipulated) was that some of the more descriptive scenes ""didn't fit"". This leads me to believe that the director(s) didn't really want a plot because a plot, in my opinon at least, would have made this movie too boring. Besides, I think that the monotony and spontaneity from which the ""events"" transpire is somewhat hilarious in and of itself.One more thing worth mentioning.... The Music. Simply hilarious, is all I can say. I liked it so much, I downloaded the album from the Itunes store. The best thing about the music is that it is so tacky, and deviant that it contextualizes the movie in a manner that could not be achieved with ""conventional"" music. The only song that I caught that was conventional was the White Stripe's song that is played at the beginning of the movie. The music almost sounds like something you would hear in a cartoon or videogame from the 80's (I'm assuming that in order to create the ultimate setting, the directors chose this type of music, especially the song that's played during the school dance) The music is corny; but then again, what would you expect from a movie about a bespectacled nerd who draws ""Liger's"" and fights imaginary metaphysical creatures?So (in the spirit of Hollywood) here are the overall ratings for the movie (out of 4 stars):Comedy: ****Characters: ***Plot: **Music: ***Overall: ***Yeah, I thought this was a kid's movie at first and that's what initially turned me away from watching it. True, it's not the crude nerd movie that was ""Revenge of the Nerds"" but I think this is a more scaled down (albeit more exagerated) contextualization of what it's like to not be ""popular"" at High School. Agreeing with some of the other reviewers, I think that Napolean is the type of nerd other nerd's look down on. Maybe you can look down on him laugh at him too. I and everybody else I know sure got a kick out of the movie."	5.0	The Subtle Monotany of a Nerd's Nerd	2005-04-12	3	2	1

Sweet!- Peter Travers, ROLLING STONEHilarious.- New York PostWonderfully Original.- PeopleThere you have the box reviews. Now you will have my review. I want to say two things before I press play on the menu to start the movie - 1. The looping Casiotones rock! 2. I'm afraid this is going to be a movie all about my life.The intro is pretty sweet. I like the foods idea, my favorite one was the edited Lemonheads box.Wow... I'm seventeen minutes in and I'm really not sure what's going on other than he's a complete dork. Yes, I am scared, because seventeen minutes in, he is me, only with slightly worse fashion sense, and the jocks never beat me up.Real quick question - since when do llamas eat ham? I love this. It's weird.... the Dynamites live in the eighties, but at the same time in the naughts. They have the Internet and cool shiny bikes, and it's like he fell out of twenty years ago. I love it!Tetherball is an awesome sport sometimes, but it helps if you have someone to play with.I love how Trisha's mom is forcing her to go to the prom! I wish I would have asked someone out that was hot and an overbearing control-freak mother that made her go to the Prom.Mmmm, Tater Tots. I'm hungry now.Dance - 80s music rules!!!! (Even if it is Cyndi Lauper. :P)La Fwanda(sp?) - Eww, what an ugly girl! (I've not made it far enough, but I am guessing that she is going to turn out to be a he.) (Well, I guess I was wrong)I just now officially saw two movies in a row with a sai involved (Elektra). Jennifer Garner I trusted to have some, but Napoleon Dynamite? Yikes!It's amazing what a change a slight makeover can do. Kip looks relatively cool, yet still dorky as a biker dude. Napoleon should do that. I'm a little shocked at how normal he actually looks. (Jon Heder that is)Well, this is ridiculous type funny. You'd think I would have gotten that before I rented it, but that's okay.I am bursting out with laughter right now watching him dance. He does so much better than I ever could!Overall, pretty good movie. I might buy it someday.	4.0	Cookieman108 Took My Headline	2005-07-07	3	1	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2C9FXDJ8G24KS	Justin Hambly	I read really bad reviews about this movie before watching it. Some said it was funny for the first ten minutes and then flat the rest of the time. This film was really hilarious. It was filled with little jewels. Lines that are very quotable and unforgettable. Uncle Rico is the classic loser uncle who thinks he is cool and his scamming with Kip is classic. Napoleon is someone that is indescribable. He is everybody from you high school and no body from your high school. I was worried the whole time that I might find out a little of myself in him. Buy this one right now it is going to be one of the classic films in you collection right next to Rad, North Shore, Big Lebowski, Better Off Dead, Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Etc.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A34R5L24FEVP5E	"Justin Lee ""cocoablini"""	If this was supposed to be social criticism, it's not. If this was supposed to be funny, it's not. If this was supposed to be avant guard, it's not.This film is weighed down by a desperation to be quirky and esoteric. I can just see the sweat on the screenwriters as they draw up the weirdest people they can imagine, which in reality is a serious case of writer's block. The problem mainly arises when the director refuses to stop assuming that the viewer thinks inactivity and vacuity is infinitely humorous. The acting is overly deadpan, stiff and lethargic-which I assume is on purpose. What ensues is viewer irritation after 10 minutes. This is especially true since the spurts of energy that we do see are irrelevant and gag oriented. This is a series of plotless vignettes,literally plodding on for 1 and 1/2 hours. The humor is odd and the director so self satisfied with his own smugness he didn't step back to think that esoteric for the sake of esoteric is...weird? Weird for weird sake begets confusion and loss of interest. As the Amazon review points out, there is no sense of disgust and anger-so we get twee 8 year old humor.This is an Indie film for people who don't like indies.	2.0	Expecting a hilarous movie?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2842ZX880GKYN	"Just Michelle ""Michelle"""	"...I'm so sorry!  I loved it.  I have to admit, the first five to ten minutes had me thinking, ""What the heck is going on?""  And it took me a while to catch the ""feeling"" of the movie.  It's not really like any other movie I've seen, really.  It kind of jumps from one thing to another without transitions, so I guess some film afficionados could fault it for its uneven, disjointed feel.  Or Pedro's odd, unexplained absences from school, or why he felt so hot when no one else did, and went home to cool off (like that would make a difference).  Why???  But I think it was its total departure from the typical film style that actually drew me in...more like life, a series of unconnected events that eventually lead to something interesting.True, a lot of its appeal is the fact that people can laugh at its characters' foibles, but if a person is truly honest, they'll have to admit that at some level they relate to him when he does dumb things.  Like hitting on a girl by saying the following line (sure to make you swoon!):""I see you're drinking 1%.  Is that 'cuz you think you're fat?...(long pause here)....'Cuz you're not.  You could totally drink whole if you wanted to.""Bring out the smelling salts, baby!  Think I'm gonna faint!  What a sauve character.There have been many, many ""nerd"" movies, and I don't think most of them ""get it"" when it comes to the real thing.  There's always some kind of magical transformation that says, ""Gee, this person wasn't so nerdy after all"" or some kind of vindication of their great intellect, or something.  At the end of this one, although he is applauded, let's face it, Napoleon is still about the nerdiest guy you'll ever meet.  And, um, sorry, but there's no great intellectual prowess to be had, either.  Even taming a wild honeymoon stallion isn't quite enough to get Napoleon out of nerd-dom, and no amount of ""bling,"" even by his beloved Lafawn""duh"" (as he spells it!) is enough to enable Napoleon's brother Kip to actually be hip when he sings to her.Okay, so it's a weird movie, full of weird people.  But I have to say, I have met plenty of Uncle Ricos, Kips, Napoleons, and even people like his grandma.  And I lived in a house with 1970's shag carpet, dark wood paneling, and gold foil wallpaper with olive and orange flowers on it.  So yeah, I guess you could say that I was a nerd who didn't ""get it,"" just like Napoleon.It's not for everyone, but for what it's worth, I loved it.  There's no sex in it other than suggestiveness, and the worst language in it is an improvised, ""I'd be p----- off, too,"" in a quiet conversation.  The people who say they want the 90 minutes of their life back after this movie may not have seen ""American Psycho.""  Now that'a a film which I believe actually warrants saying, it's REALLY not worth seeing!  You'll want your life back, and a brain scrubber afterward, never mind the brilliant cast and occasional humor."	5.0	To those who didn't like this movie.....	2006-10-15	7	6	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AYJJB8C8K1R9T	Just Reed	A lot of people thought that this movie was a disappointment and had no meaning to it. Clearly this movie has a meaning to it. It's about a guy who gets picked on in high school every day of his life and still decides to live his life no matter how hard things get. When things are as worse as they can get for ND, it seems as if he knows that things can only go up.Some people say that this movie sucked because this movie was a low budget film, it took only 22 days to shoot, it seems as if it jumps from timeline to timeline or that it has dead humor. Some of the best movies of all time were low budget and took little time to make. And there are some movies that cost over 100 million dollars to make that weren't even good.The movie does sort of seem like it jumps back and forth from the eighties to the nineties. The movie does use songs from the eighties and fashion that you would've probably recognized from a John Hughes film. But, not everything in the movie represents something from the eighties though. Napoleon does have wierd clothes but I would be pretty sure that they would be clothes that the nerdy guy in school would wear. His best friend Pedro comes from the south, where Latino culture is well known and represented. His clothes are pretty much up to date for being where he is from. How many people down south don't wear jeans and cowboy boots? Then there is ND's friend, Deb. She's her own fashion designer which would pretty much explain how she dresses during most of the movie. Last but not least, ND's Uncle Rico. Rico is a guy, in about his forties, who is pretty much stuck in 1982 and wishes that he had the chance to back in time to change his future. Come on, how many people have wanted to do that? He does dress in eighties attire, only because he thinks he still there.Let's face it folks, comedy is the genre where Hollywood needs help. We have horror and action films galore. Sometimes I ask myself, how can we have a comedy with so little comedic talent. We do have some funny people on the big screen, but we're seeing less and less of the people that can still make us laugh harder than anyone on the big screen now. Jamie Fox and Jim Carey are playing more serious roles, Chapelle is making a really big impact on his tv show but it would be great to have him back on the big screen. ND does have dead humor and sarcasm, but that was the backbone for comedy for quite sometime. From the Naked Guns to the Ace Ventura's. It would be great to have comedies like Pryor or Murphy used to make, but that's not going to happen. ND is probably the closest we will get to old school humor.On the contrary, I read something about someone saying that Lizzie McGuire was better than ND. I only have one question, what in the heck were you doing watching that movie? I would suppose that this person watches her show too. And just too let everyone know, if you read the facts about ND, you will read that they do tell you that a Liger is a real animal. to know that, you have to have read the quotes or you have to be a reall geek.......This movie may seem dumb at frist, but give it another shot and you'll see that this movie is worth owning and why people, who hate or love it, keep on rambling on about Napoleon Dynamite. Pay attention to what people say and enjoy the laughter. This movie is very original in it's own way and has the potetial to win probably just an eMpTy Vision Movie Award.	4.0	Don't be an idiot!

Why try to equate this movie with reality? It's just a nostalgia-tainted movie that shows one weird scene after another. Anyone who was a teen in the early 80's will love the atmosphere, anyone living in rural America will grin at the scenery, but other than that...c'mon, let's just chalk these characters up to playful cinematic fun.

Because it has no other value, other than perhaps for the purpose of studying the effects of boredom on the human psyche.  I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser.  I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting?Also, the other characters are really weak.  The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen.I  thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong.I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that.In summary, might be worth it if you can rent it cheap and get a backup movie, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.	1.0	Dumbest movie in years.	2005-01-25	15	4	11

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AG65V3LSYO191	Kate	What a wonderfully inventive honest and hilarious movie this was, particularly when compared to the Hollywood sap that graces our screens these days. It was unbelievably deadpan, completely orginal and right from the opening credits made of various foods, i knew it was undoubtedly one of the best movies I have seen this year. Yet totally underrated.It was wonderfully acted, from Napoleon to his afeminine brother and Spanish friend to his side ponytailed love interest/friend. The entire production was graced with a 1980s air that lends itself to social commentary about the progression (or lack thereof) of rurality, and even the costumes etc are incredibly well thought out and contribute to the entire work.But the point, is there is no point. Nothing is learnt, developed, and the story is hardly plot driven. Yet the entire piece works magnificantly to go absolutely nowhere, and clearly, there should be a deemphasis on the complete conclusions and perfect Hollywood stars. This film is incredibly unique and should be viewed to understand why it works so wonderfully.The humour is very remincient of 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' or 'Ghost World', and yet this work is perhaps more approachable and likable.	5.0	Just 'awesome'!	2004-10-30	4	4	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A7EEMNDTEDCFV	Kate Lee	"As a college student, going to the movies is a little above my price range, but I am surrounded by people who can get anything off the Internet in a matter of hours. A friend of mine gave us a housewarming gift this semester: our very own copy of Napoleon Dynamite. He had downloaded it before it had even come out in major theaters here. None of us had seen it before, but over the months to follow we became intimately familiar with every line and character. There's no other way to put it - this movie is brilliant. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again. In fact, you have to. It creeps up on you. The first time you watch it it's pretty funny, but you don't think it's anything special. You go about your life. But over the next couple of days you find yourself saying strange things that you've never said before... Things like ""I wish you would get out of my life and SHUT UP!"" and ""That's true, that's true."" and ""How much you want to bet I could throw a pigskin over them mountains?"" Everyone frustrating in your life is easily brushed off with a ""GOSH! What an IDIOT!"" No one knows what you're talking about, but you know that someday they'll all understand.The soundtrack is also amazing. Many songs I've known for years and loved on their own merit -- Most notably Jamiroquai's ""Canned Heat,"" have taken on new meaning.  Before, the song made me have to get up and dance whenever I heard it. It still does, but now it makes me laugh also. This movie is so amazing that I intend on purchasing a copy of the DVD -- or at least getting my parents to buy it for me for Christmas! While that may not seem like a big deal to many of you readers, let me tell you that for a college student, with limited funds but unlimited ability to get any form of media off the internet or college network, it is.There's really no way to describe the actual content of this movie. Suffice it to say that it's set in an ambiguous time period (Sometime between the 80s and the present) with characters of ambiguous ages (Napoleon could be in middle school, or he could be a high school senior. It's believable either way). Each and every character is absolutely priceless, including the periphery characters like the ubiquitous public school jock, the little boy on the bus who asks ""What are you going to do today, Napoleon?"" and good old Lyle. I've said enough. See it. Even if you don't find it funny, it's a world that you would be sad to miss out on."	5.0	Funniest thing I've seen in years	2004-12-10	2	1	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3TGHK20ZKZFRP	Kazuo	"I must say...what type of sad world do we live in where someone can simply post a 1-star review of Napoleon Dynamite, say nothing more than ""This is the worst movie ever! It wasn't funny at all!"", and get a ""4 out of 12 people found the following review helpful""? Has our intelligence and patience really sunk THIS low?! Come on! I know this movie isn't for everybody, and has a style of humor that 1/4th of the people who see it won't get, but seriously! People who post reviews like that are the main reason why this movie shouldn't have become popular. Back when this was still a semi-obscure indie movie, everyone who went out of their way to see it loved it, but now that it's popular, the average mainstream moviegoer/MTV whore is just going to think this movie is ""weird"" and ""pointless"" (If you need proof: Notice that 90% of the negative reviews were posted after the movie skyrocketed in popularity). If you've seen this movie multiple times, have tried to ""get it"", and failed, then that's okay. But if you're just a mindless basher who knows nothing about deadpan/oddball humor...then I'm sorry. I can't respect that at all.That being said, Napoleon Dynamite was one of the best movies of 2004, besides Collateral and Kill Bill: Vol. 2. At a time where Hollywood has sunk to an all-time low with their endless inferior remakes of classic films (Flight Of The Phoenix, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and nonstop streams of comic-book movies (The Punisher, The Hulk), this delightful indie movie was a gigantic breath of fresh air (and a gigantic slap in the face to Tinseltown's big budget sets and plastic actors). I remember seeing this movie in theatres in July 2004 (before it became really popular) with my equally geeky friends, and accidently spilling my coffee all over the floor from laughing so hard.Set in the semi-rural town of Preston, Idaho, Napoleon Dynamite is the story of a ranting, nerdy teenager who's simply trying to deal with his crazy life, both at school and at home. His 32-year old brother Kip is obsessed with chatrooms and his internet-girlfriend (as well as ""becoming a cage fighter""), his grandma loves riding dune buggies, everyone at school doesn't know what to make of his bizzare set of interests (martial arts, computer hacking, U.F.O.'s, ""Nessie""), and to top it all off, there's a new kid at school named Pedro who just moved there from Tijuana! Luckily, Pedro's friendship may be all Napoleon needs to help turn his life around.The end result is 89 minutes of quirky, off the wall humor that you could previously only find in Election or Rushmore. The film turns into a showcase for rookie talent, as Jon Heder & Aaron Ruell are great as the nerdy Dynamite brothers, and first time writer/director Jared Hess gives the movie a deliciously lo-fi feel.The dialogue alone is something to be marveled at. Like one of my friends said: The ""memorable quotes"" (...)to have the entire script of this movie. Much like in ""Office Space"", pretty much every line is up for grabs, from ""Go make yourself a dang quesadilla"" to ""You guys are retarted!"" to ""Your mom goes to college!"". If you're in high school, you've probably heard (or been bombarded with) these quotes for the last few months, so why not take the time to see the movie that spanwed them?The only real flaw I see with the movie is that even with the added epilogue, and the deleted scenes...it's just too friggin' short. But what counts is that it's a great ride while it lasts...and it feels far fresher than any other movie I saw last year.****/*****"	4.0	What a bunch of flippin' idiots.	2005-06-22	10	7	3
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3R633H9EJ6VVP	K. Bowers	Napoleon Dynamite is probably the worst movie ever made. But somehow, it is the best. It is one of the rare movies that you will find that is not afraid to be totally, and completely stupid and that has no point whatsoever. But hey, I love it.Napoleon Dynamite is not your typical highschool student. He is one of those freaks that you made fun of and thanked goodness that you weren't him. But the thing is, Napoleon is completely comfortable with himself and is confident enough to ask the most popular girl in school to play teather ball with him, even though she declined, of course.Napoleon's friends aren't too average either.Let's begin with Pedro (finally, the reason for the endless Vote for Pedro t-shirts). Pedro is the new kid. He's spanish and for some reason, he's kinda popular. He is ready to find a date to the dance and actually gets one. He also decides to run for Class President. And wins.Then there's Deb. The girl Napoleon meets when she shows up on his doorstep selling keychains and Glamour Shots. She's shy and really weird. And she drinks two percent (even when Napoleon says she could drink whole if she wanted). And guess what? Napoleon is in love with her.Next up is Uncle Rico. He has problems. And lots of them. He gets crazy business ideas and will do anything to get them to sell. Including dragging poor Napoleon along with him.And then there's Kip. Kip has been chatting online with babes ALL day. And he's found his soul mate, LaFonda (who happens to be a chubby black woman). But hey, we all have our types.This movie takes place back in the 80's (which I was not alive during so I have no clue what they're talking about). The humor is not presented in an intentional way, but it still gets laughs. This movie has no point or plot. It just kind of goes on and on and on. And the first time you watch it, you will HATE it. But the second time it's completely hilarious. Just don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it. The actors do a good job acting like mindless idiots and you'll love learning the one-liners that Napoleon is famous for. Just check it out. So what if it's a complete waste of your time? It's too stupid to miss out on.	4.0	So stupid, that it's Funny!	2005-10-30	6	2	4

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2D9IEFJGB483Q	Kendal B. Hunter	"There are two rival trends today in Mormon comedy. The first, and more unsuccessful, IMHO, embraces the ""Singles Ward"" family of films. There are a mixture of the solid Hale Family of thespians, with a mixture of the Brigham Young University's ""Divine Comedy"" and ""Garrens"" troupes.  They have the more slapstick, and even  Church Talent Night feel to them. In essence, they are the Jay Leno's of Mormondom.The other trend are the independent humorists, such as [...] and this film Napoleon Dynamite.  They are outside the normal institution and organs of Mormon humor, and therefore had to struggle to make their comedy work.  They are the David Lettermens of the Mormondom.  Which is why they are actually funnier.What can I say about this film?  When you present an anti-hero as hero, your competition is primarily the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" franchise.  To his credit, Hess is able to have the same vibe, transplant it to southern Idaho, and throw in some Theater of the Absurd to boot.That is what you are getting, and that is why the film works with so many people.  If, as Carl Matheson assets, ""The Simpsons"" humor is ""hyper-irony,"" then this film's humor is ""hyper-quirkiness.""  It melds Seinfeld ""A show about nothing,"" with Babbitt's mediocrity.  The dialogue is two steps above drivel, but that is the charm of the movie.  You get a series of ""A Slice Of Life"" themes that are like the prop GNDN tubes on Star Trek: ""Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing.""Sometimes I got he feeling that I was watching a so-called ""reality show,"" where a person makes no real intellectual or moral development in the process of the film.  Maybe ND is just a good natured Forrest Gump shipwrecked in Idaho.I think the key to the movie is ND's conceptual reference point. He reminds me of Calvin from the funnies-some panels Hobbes is a stuffed tiger, but in the more interesting panels Hobbs is as alive as Calvin's parents.  C. S. Lewis mentions that he had this same problem growing up: he had the external realm of studies and family, but he has the vibrant inner world of Wagner and Boxon, which at times, was more real than the so-called real world (Surprised By Joy, Chapter 8).ND has the same problem. He speaks of the liger, with it's magical properties, has the retro-80's ""Pegasus Crossing"" sign on his door, and the poster to the classic film ""Dragonslayer.""  He is obsessed with nun-chucks and judo skills, but doesn't quite understand why he should wear the kung-fu pants.  He buys the suit at the Deseret Industries thrift store, but doesn't see that it looks weird, even with his retro 70's looks in the retro 80's town.  For ND, his clothes have become so old, they are back in style again.So there you have him: the fluctuating reference point-he has not quite left the magical stage that most of us leave in out early teens (See ""The Road Less Traveled, p. 86-87).  This magical point of view is his charm is. He is a man-child like Brian Wilson or Wildman Fischer.  If Napoleon grows up, he will either be a total failure, or a monumental success.  With the white horse, things for Napoleon is looking up.NOTE:  for the love of mud, DO NOT DO A SEQUAL!  This film has to end as abruptly as it began.  ND has to stay a retro 70's teenager in a retro 80's town lost somewhere in the retro 00's.  Do anything-a documentary, a prequel, or even a Saturday cartoon series with a breakfast cereal tie-in, but no sequel!"	4.0	NDs' Conceptual reference	2005-01-15	4	1	3

This movie just fell flat in so many ways and was so slow paced, the character were unlikable, the humor was dry as the Mohave desert. Don't get me wrong I do like some dry humor like The Monty Python movies but Napoleon Dynamite was beyond dry. There were maybe 2 funny parts I can count in the whole movie. But don't take my word for it, give a chance and go ahead and rent it. You might like it but for me it was a waste of time and a rental fee.	1.0	Snore Fest  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz	2008-03-04	16	5	11

Apparently everyone that lives in his town is a loser too. This town of losers makes for an interesting story. The lives of Napoleon and his friends are quite strange, in a funny way. This movie has a very thin plot. Napoleon helps his friend win the student counsel election, gets a fairly cute girlfriend, and avoids getting wrapped up in his uncle's insane schemes. After that, he successfully goes to the prom and steals the show at the school talent show. This guy is a loser, but he can dance like a mofo. If you haven't seen Napoleon get beat up, have his tater tots smashed in his pants, and dance his heart out, you are missing out.	4.0	A movie like no other	2012-11-22	1	1	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1RJGDN1AD2PNO	Kevin Davis	"It's not that I don't ""get it"" because I understood the jokes, and I knew why they were supposed to be funny. They just weren't (for the most part). I consider myself to have impeccable taste in comedies: 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is, hands down, the funniest movie of all time. Close behind is 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Tommy Boy'. Other faves are 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy'. In other words, I know a funny movie when I see it. 'Airplane!', for example, has a lot of the dry ""stupid funny"" humour that 'Napoleon Dynamite' attempts but fails miserably. If you haven't seen the movies I mentioned (especially 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'), I highly recommend you see what you're missing. The only reason that this movie can do so well among young people (of which I am one -- 22 years old) is because they (we) have been deprived of quality comedies (1995's 'Tommy Boy' being the last great comedy).If you think trite jokes about a guy ""stuck in the 80's"" are funny, then, by all means, get 'Napoleon Dynamite'. If you think ""liger"" (Napoleon's favorite mythical creature -- a cross b/w a lion and tiger) is funny, then get 'Napoleon Dynamite'. If you share my tastes in comedies, then avoid. Don't waste two hours of your life and certainly don't waste your money. I doubt this will truly become a cult classic; it simply isn't funny."	1.0	simply not funny	2005-03-21	22	7	15
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1VC12X91HMOPN	Kevin Ivey	"The wonderful thing about ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the humanity of the characters.  Perhaps those who did not find this movie funny were either (a) like Summer Wheatley, so wrapped up in themselves that they never took any effort to really know the people around them, or (b)have yet to learn to laugh at themselves and their own shortcomings.  The characters are well-developed and deeper than they first appear, and the actors have perfected their characters' personas. The situations are what makes this film so funny, and when you stop to think about the things that you thought were so important to you in High School, it makes this film even funnier.This movie is bursting with heart, and carries two important messages that could be heard loud and clear above the laughter: (1) IT TAKES TREMENDOUS PERSONAL FORTITUDE TO RISK LOOKING LIKE A FOOL TO HELP A FRIEND, and (2) REGARDLESS OF HOW GEEKY, HAPLESS OR DIFFERENT YOU ARE, THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS WORLD WHO WILL LOVE YOU.  When it comes down to it, those are the core teachings of Christ: ""There is no greater love than to lay down your life for a friend"", and ""Love your neighbor as yourself"". For anyone who has ever suffered humiliation at the hands of those who did not have the courage to be themselves, or to take any stand whatsoever, this movie rings true.Moreover, like ""The Breakfast Club"" and other teen movies that came after, ""Napolean Dynamite"" gives us a glimpse of adolescence through the actions and reactions of characters who have no idea that they are living some of the best times of their lives.  As sad and frustrating as Napoleon's existence seems to be, there are two characters in the film who affirm that the future will be more and less than he imagines. Older brother Kip finds true love in his chat-room soulmate (""LaFawnduh is the best thing that ever happened to me... Napoleon, I'm sure you will find your soulmate one day"").  Uncle Rico so longs for his lost youth and a second chance that he resorts to a ""time machine"" that he buys on-line (""If coach had just put me in for the fourth quarter, we would have won state. I just know it!""). In each case, the elder characters' lives serve as confirmation and caution for the future.One last thumbs-up for this film:  It proves that a film can be entertaining, funny and meaningful without coarse language, gratuitous sex or violence, or a $20 million budget.Well done Mr. and Mrs. Hess!

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A31FS3JMUW4KRH	Kevin Mcclements	"There is no plot to this low budget movie. It is just the compialation of everyday life of Napoleon an ultra-nerd. This movie is devoid of sex,drugs,crime and profanity, sure I like that stuff in some movies but, not in every movie...This is a great change.Many negative reviewers say there aren't any redeeming qualities of the main character this, however, is definately not the case.  Napoleon does good deeds for his friends and takes a lot of punishment from others without lashing out at the world. Where most people would just fall into self pity, Napoleon keeps on trucking.If you have a decent sense of humor you might find yourself quoting this movie nonstop and watching it 9 times in a ""two day rental period""-Good thing Blockbuster got rid of late fees.People who hate this movie either A)Have no sense of humor or B) were very popular and can't relate at all to Napoleon.

I'm sure that the ""human condition"" story of Sad Sack Napoleon will be of interest to some, but not to many.  Certainly not to me.It's a lot like listening to someone else's therapy session about a particularly awkward adolescence.  2 stars because it's well done for what it is."	2.0	Tedious	2005-02-16	9	4	5
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"At some point in our lives, we've all been the geek.  Some of us(like myself), have been the geek one too many times.  This film lets us laugh at those who are geeks, those who beat up the geeks, and the snobby little popular girls who toy with the geeks.The film is basically about a few days in the life of a not-so-likeable dork named Napoleon, and his more likeable friend, Pedro, as well as his chatroom-happy brother, Kip, and his uncle, Rico.  They are all losers in one way or another.  Rico's trapped in the past, like so many former high school jocks.  Kip has fallen in love with his on-line friend he has never met.  Pedro is just kind of there, too shy to really stand out.  Then there's Napoleon.  He is in a class all to himself.  He draws fantasy creatures(I can relate), likes to save tater tots for later(in his pockets, unwrapped), and is pretty annoying all in all.Pedro is in love with the school's most popular girl(Hilary Duff's sister), but she doesn't even know he exists, until he decides to run against her for class president.  Even then, she blows him off as no threat.  Napoleon is sort of his campaign manager and his ""secret service captain.""  He also sort of pursues Deb, another geek played perfectly by Tina Majorino.  She's been in a ton of films, primarily playing a child.  The only one that comes to mind right now is ""Waterworld.""  Kip's internet love comes to visit and she turns out to be an amazonian black beauty who changes his life forever.  Rico still clings to what might have been.The humor of this film is scattered over brief moments in the lives of the aforementioned geeks.  They get beat up, picked on, etc., just like any normal kid who was the outcast in school.  Whether or not you feel guilty for laughing at them, you have to laugh because the best humor is found in the truth, and this film is loaded with that.Highly recommended to folks who are willing to watch this film more than once because you will definitely catch things that you missed before.  It is definitely worthy of multiple viewings.Also, stick around after the credits role to see one of the best moments of the film.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	The director Jared Hess brings the viewers a minimalistic comedy about a complete loser, Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), with no self-esteem, skills, or friends.  The film is on occasion offensively straightforward as it pokes directly on Napoleon through the way he dresses, behaves, and how people around him act toward him.  Several geek films has been made in the past such as Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Rushmore (1998), and American Pie (1999), but Napoleon Dynamite delivers a film unique in the sense that it is directly making fun of the nerd.  This is, on occasion, hilarious as the things that Napoleon does seem awkward and embarrassing, yet there is a finer touch of compassion for him as he struggles with his daily endeavors.  In a sense it becomes much like a clown show at a circus.  It is funny, but at the expense of the main character.The film displays a number of episodic events that comprise a cinematic montage of Napoleon's lifestyle.  Through the montage the audience learns that Napoleon lives with his grandmother and his older brother, that is a nerd much like himself.  The mise-en-scene and the script also lays out the groundwork for why Napoleon is a nerd, as nobody really offers him help with anything.  This tall gangly high school kid that constantly has his mouth open while he peaks through his glasses like a mole attempts to separate the shadows in order to distinguish what is in front of him.  It is impossible not to feel sorry for him while laughing at his idiosyncrasies.The audience is presented with how he becomes friends with Pedro (Efren Ramirez), a new student in his school, and with Deb (Tina Majorino).  Through their minute help Napoleon finds an insignificant amount of courage as it provides him with enough hope to begin regaining some of his lost self-esteem.  The quest for something better also has it's difficulties as Napoleon must deal with his scheming uncle Rico, who brings his older brother into his schemes, as they also offend him in public.  The struggle that Napoleon is fighting is for his own place in society as he wants something better, yet his awkwardness within society makes it difficult for him to adjust.  Besides Napoleon's struggle there are several amusing situations such as when he must feed his grandmother's lama and the drawing he sends to a girl he wants to ask out to an upcoming school dance.The opening credits seem to have been influenced by Dogma 95 as it uses food and pictures in order to introduce the cast and crew of the film.  Nonetheless, it is a fun and clever beginning that sets the tone for the rest of the film.  The camera work and story bear some similarities with Rushmore (1998) and Royal Tenenbaums (2001) by Wes Anderson, but it does not copy these films as it remains unique.  The story is fragmented in chronological order and Napoleon leaves a lasting imprint with the audience.  Yet, the story itself does not seem to leave much of anything for the audience to ponder, but maybe the film will give some extra laughs with friends thanks to Jon Heder's character in the film.	3.0	Insightful Nerd Comedy...	2004-12-30	5	1	4

The uncle in the movie has some occasionaly funny moments but the rest of it is bland and lifeless.Don't get me the wrong. The acting is excellent... but the Characters are so fatally annoying that watching the movie becomes a burden.Reading through the reviews it seems obvious that the majority of people who have given this movie 5 stars are geeks who can relate to the characters in the movie.If you are not a geek or not being bullied then the film is quite frankly urinatarily microscopic in its pisitional farcance of blimpish follery.	1.0	Doesn't live up to the hype	2005-03-03	19	3	16
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AGKJF15QQNVX6	"klownboy ""klownboy"""	"One of the earlier reviewers did an excellent job of critiquing the frequently clueless Roger Ebert for his complete misunderstanding of this character and this movie.  Napoleon is a rural supernerd who doesn't want or need the acceptance of those around him.  He doesn't long to be popular, he doesn't really care what people think of him, he just wants the space to be himself.What's great about the character is that Naploen doesn't really change at all through the course of the movie.  Sure, he helps a friend win a student election and manages to find a girl; but these are the result of Napoleon being who he is, not because he changed or grew into something else.  He starts the movie as an almost monotonal, oblivious, strangely dressed little boy - and that's exactly how he is at the end of the movie.  He doesn't even seem to realize it, but he's changed a lot of the people around him.  Pedro gets some self confidence, Deb finds a guy who accepts her, Kip is happy, and even uncle Rico manages to stumble into a good deal.Not that I care one way or the other, but the movie manages to be enormously entertaining without resorting to potty humor or wholesale swearing even once.  An impressive feat considering the status quo of ""comedies"" these days.My only gripe would be with the ""extra"" scene that was added in after the credits when the movie started earning some bucks.  It really just seems tacked on and kind of pointless.  I would have rather seen a few more minutes at the chicken farm, or some time spent showing how Rico met his girlfriend, or even some more of Napoleon as the biggest kid on the school bus. The tetherball game was the perfect ending for this movie, and nothing was gained by the addition of the new post-credits scene.If you want something to compare it to, it carries a lot of the same pleasantly deluded loser vibe that ""Bottle Rocket"" had, along with a similarly great soundtrack.  It's a great date movie, and a superior original low-budget comedy.Now if I can only get my hands on a D-Qwon's Dance-grooves VHS, I'll be OK."	5.0	Dude, you got like 2 feet of air.	2004-09-27	10	10	0

It has a real subtle style, some might even call it bland, it's not for everyone. Napoleon is the guy you either ignored or beat up in high school (or you were him) - he tells tall tales of his prowess with a bow staff! His pasty-skinned brother, an uncle stuck in his own past glory days and the shy girl with a crush are all perfectly crafted as well. My favorite scenes were when Napoleon drew the picture of the girl he wanted to take to the dance for her and his note was like 'there's plenty more where this came from' and the drawing is the most grotesque, childish likeness of the girl. Then when Pedro is running for class president, Napoleon gives a nerd getting bullied a boondoggle keychain and says 'Pedro offers you his protection', then when the school bully tries to take the kid's bike, Pedro's cousins in the low rider come by. There are lots of great little moments, mostly when Napoleon is in his own little, oblivious world of Ligers and whatnot.	4.0	Heck yeah it's funny....gosh!	2005-02-12	5	4	1

For the first hour I couldn't exactly pinpoint what year in the 80's this movie was reflecting. With trapper keepers and caboodles and wacky t-shirts and off color matching wardrobes, I was sure it was 85 or 86. Only to come and realize near the end that Napoleon Dynamite ( every high schools nerd ) and all his friends weren't actually living in the 80's but only in Idaho and anytown that hasn't exactly progressed with the rest of America. It is a hilarious and completely unique funny film with mostly unknown actors ( which just adds to it's believability )and there is no profanity, no nudity or sexual references, all the humor lies within an open mouthed, eyes wide shut when speaking teenager, a shy girl, Deb who promotes herself door to door and offers to take ""glamour like shots"" for a discount at up to 75% off. Pedro, a simple English speaking kid who dreams of asking out the popular girl Summer and becoming school president.It's fresh and honest and sometimes just real for we've all been to those dances and we all remember those kids.Napoleon Dynamite is a celebration to all nerds and idiots alike...everywhere and anywhere...who ultimatley succeed in this world."	5.0	No it's not the 80's!

I will make it my mission to watch it every Sunday, right after Revenge of the Nerds, and right before Trading Places, my other two favorite comedies. 1) Do I care about MTV's endorsement of it, financial support, or whatever? No, I don't care. 2) Do I like this movie because my friends do? No, the majority of them haven't even seen it. 3) Do I like this movie to fit in or because I'm in search of some sort of hipster points or art-movie cred'? No, I'm 27 years old, and I've known all my life that a ton of things that are funny to me aren't funny to others. Besides, I find EVERYTHING funny, including many commercials, so I'm easily pleased, I guess.  I think the idea of a lion and a tiger merging to become one animal called a Liger is damn funny. 4) Do I care about whether this movie is an honest depiction of growing up in Idaho? No, but I could totally relate to the stereotypes portrayed in it. IN CONCLUSION: A lot of the criticism levelled at this movie on this site assumes that people spend their time heralding weird films because it's cool and somehow gains you status points.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1B451QKRY2KRS	"Lee Charles Kelley ""dog trainer/mystery novelist"""	"This movie caught me by complete surprise.  I was expecting a typical dumb teen flick about a lovable nerd with unfortunate hair, slacker wardrobe, and a silly name reminiscent of Yahoo Serious!, but this film is totally its own animal.  Some reviewers have likened it to a male WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE (far from it) or to early Jim Jarmusch.  It's better, in its own way, than both.The Jarmusch comparison I get, though you could as easily, and as superficially, compare this film's director, Jared Hess, to fellow BYU-alum Neal LaBute.  Or maybe Hess was influenced by Renoir or Kurosawa or Pasolini, who knows?  (Though clearly not by Tarantino.)  And while it's true that when Jarmusch started his career he tended to do scenes in one long take, with fixed camera angles, mostly (or so he's said) to save money on film stock, and that Jared Hess may have had some of the same budgetary restrictions, I don't think that has anything to do with the way the film was shot.  And I'll tell you why: there is a knowing, almost insouciant intelligence behind the mise-en-scene of every camera angle, and of every action that takes place within each frame of this film.For example, late in the film there's a shot of a road in Idaho, seen from a distance.  The only action?  A yellow school bus enters frame on the left, leisurely travels through the middle of the shot, then exits.  That's it.  There's no real reason for that shot to be there.  It doesn't further the plot, it does nothing to develop the relationships between the characters, all of which means that technically it's a ""waste"" of film.So why is it there?  Because when you live in a small town in Idaho (as I have), sometimes watching the school bus go by might be the highlight of your morning.  Some Idahoans (and I expect some Iowans and even most small town Californians or New Yorkers) tend to notice these things.The shot also runs counter to the usual Hollywood storytelling style, which would go something like this:EXTERIOR: Road.  A yellow school bus enters then crosses the frame.CUT TO:INTERIOR - The Bus.  Napoleon and Deb are sitting on a bench, too shy to talk to one another.  In the b.g. Summer and her coterie are happily making fliers for the election....(etc.)By inserting just such an (apparently meaningless) shot into his film, and by playing against our expectations of what cinematic grammar dictates should follow (a scene inside the bus), Hess plays a game with the audience, drawing us in, making us into another character in the story, if you will, because in our forcibly detached observations of the action our minds need to fill in the blanks the way a small town observer with nothing else to do is forced to watch a local school bus until it moves out of sight.  With just one shot (though there are many others like it) Hess has turned us all into denizens of small town Idaho.What really got to me, though, even more than the throwaway shot of the school bus, or the amazing dance ""skit"" Napoleon performs at the election rally, is the game of tetherball he plays with Deb, the girl he likes, at the very end of the film.It starts off as a lame, incredibly awkward back-and-forth, as if the two actors had never played the game before.  Or perhaps as if the director could only afford to do this scene in one take and hadn't had time to let the actors rehearse beforehand.  But the way that little game of tetherball ends, and the way the camera slowly pulls back as it builds to that ending, you're reminded of the way N.D. threw Summer's campaign button down the school hall.  He did it awkwardly, yes (which is the way he does almost everything).  But he also did it with all his might.  He threw it as hard as he could.So as he starts to ""cream"" Deb at tetherball you grin and realize that this scene sums up what the entire movie (and what the character of Napoleon Dynamite) is all about.  He loves Deb, so he starts off playing as awkwardly as she does.  But in the end he can't help himself.  He has to hit that ball as hard as he can.  As he does, Deb ducks under it, a little nervously at first, then with a kind of proud wonder at how hard this boy she likes can hit the ball.  It ends up being an awkward teenage love song and more of a dance of joy than the solo he does at the election rally.  And you don't get that kind of result--that distillation of character and theme into one cinematic moment--by sheer accident or through a lack of money or rehearsal time.There's a reason this little film has attained cult status.  It's a fine first showing for a very talented director/storyteller."	4.0	Engaging First Film, Shows a Lot of Talent and Potential	2005-09-15	11	9	2

Bonus, this person lives with me, so I get to watch it also...

The weird thing is that nobody in the &#34;lesser&#34; status seems to care that they're there, it only matters to the higher-up students.  Does that mean they've gotten over this whole charade of &#34;power&#34; based on who you are, or that they've accepted their fate as losers?  And is either of those things something that the viewer should learn from as a good example?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1OKNLH9VVTYP1	"Lesley ""From Austen to zombies!"""	All the schools I attended had somebody like Napoleon: nerdy for certain, often weirdly hostile, but pretty nice if you managed to get to know them. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to be that guy (or girl), Napoleon Dynamite will show you. It will also make you wince, laugh, clap, and maybe even dance for happiness.Napoleon's home life is odd: he and his 32-year-old brother Kip live in the Middle of Nowhere, Idaho, with their grandmother and her llama, Tina. Kip stays home &#34;chatting online with babes all day&#34; while Napoleon starts another grueling school year, teased by jocks and bullies, and bossed around by Grandma. But this time he makes two new friends, glamor shot photographer Deb and Mexican transplant Pedro Sanchez. At last, his life starts to change for the better--even after Grandma gets in an accident and creepy Uncle Rico comes to stay while she recovers.Most people will either love or hate this movie. The dialogue is stilted (for effect, it seems), the humor is subtle, and Napoleon's actions are often puzzling. As with his real-life counterparts, he can be hard to figure out. Yet he's always true to himself, sometimes with bad results. But more often they're good, and by the end of the movie, you understand what he's all about.The best part of the storytelling, for me anyway, was how the events of the movie just unfold, without judgment or explanation. The director, in other words, doesn't try to tell us what to think--and that's what makes Napoleon Dynamite refreshingly, wonderfully different from pretty much any other teen movie you've ever seen. The neutral perspective may be what caused many critics, including the late Roger Ebert, to pan the film. I guess that's understandable for people who are more used to codified teen films like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where Ferris's perspective dominates so much that he even tells the audience when to go home.But if you have even a little weirdo in your personality--and unless you're Summer Wheatley, you do--you might like Napoleon. I sure did. Here's hoping that this style of storytelling will continue to grow in popularity and produce more classic movies.	5.0	What's it like to be That Guy?	2014-06-16	1	1	0

It was the most mind-numbing, sleep-inducing movie I have ever sat through.  The characters were annoying and bland to say the least.

After I saw it, I asked myself, ""What was this movie about?"" When you sit through an almost two hour movie and have no idea what it was about, then that might be your first clue that the movie sucks. I didn't laugh once during this movie. I don't think random jokes thrown into a movie are funny. Who cares about three losers in high school? Nothing happens to them! I don't understand the purpose of this movie, probably because it doesn't have one. If I haven't made myself clear yet, I'll summarize. This movie is stupid. Enough said."	1.0	Not a good movie	2005-01-18	21	2	19
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	"Have you seen shirts that read, ""Vote Pedro"" and wondered what they meant?  Have you ever walked by a Hot Topic in the last year and seen displays that show a weird looking man with frizzy hair and glasses, and walked away in puzzlement?  Then you are in the club of Napoleon uninitiated those whom have not bothered to look into this odd phenomenon known as ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  Well now is your chance to see what all the hoopla is about!I myself have a sister who works in a Hot Topic, so every time I went in there, I became bombarded by the mass of Napoleon merchandise.  Despite this, it never drove me to enough curiosity to rent it and watch it.  It looked stupid, it looked pointless, and way over publicized, indeed, it was all these things and much more!Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies that are so dumb and stupid, yet so good-natured and light-hearted, that you cannot deny it is at least mildly entertaining.  I am betting that your personal entertainment value in this movie, depends mostly on if you can enjoy nothing movies.  As this very well may be one of the biggest nothing movies made.  That is what makes it so entertaining, because it makes light of High School films in general and family life.  It makes all of us, in comparison, look like celebrities in our ""normality"".The character Napoleon Dynamite himself is such an oddball, so geeky, so weird, and gawky that anyone else around him looks cool.  The great thing about him is that he is so sure that he is cool and so sure that people must like him, just because of who he is.  Honestly I do, its hard not to like someone who is so silly, so positive that he is hot, and totally clueless, it is just sweet.There is not a whole lot of plot going on here, but it works, the whole flow of the movie is relaxed, but it works. The characters just sort of float in and out, they just sort of eek by an existence.  At the same time though, these characters are so absurd that you cannot help but wait until they come back on the screen. Characters like Uncle Rico and Kip are absurd, but at the same time, not very far-fetched.  Pedro is no doubt one of the favorites, as the clueless and geeky Mexican newcomer who runs for class president, and is Napoleon's only friend.The characters are delightfully nutty, and they make the meet of this film. Napoleon being the crux, with his sleepy-eyed expressions, open-mouth breathing, random saying such as: ""Fricking Idiots!"", ""Sweet"", and ""Get your own Tots."".  If smirk does not at least form on your lips, there may just be something wrong with you, like maybe you are dead?Hopefully, you're full alive, and you fully enjoy Napoleon Dynamite, or at least enjoy it just a little bit. If not, that's okay, maybe its just not your style, or maybe you need to lighten up. ;PGod Bless ~Amy"	4.0	A very unique sort of fim, highly worth the watch....	2005-12-14	4	2	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A37F8FVSTRJJ3S	Lisa Crow	This movie, albeit low budget, was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  I think what makes it so funny is that it's so real.  Just a couple of nerds going through life.  Actually the nerds come out on top at the end and that made me happy.  I can't explain the affection I have for this movie, but apparently the majority of people who see it feel the same way.  A guy named Napolean Dynamite??? now that in itself is funny.  I don't usually like comedies - I prefer drama or action, but I watched this one with my teenage daughter and like it so much I watched it 3 times!!  Unheard of for me.  It is well worth the money to buy it.  It will become a cult classic!  p.s.  The man who plays Napolean in the movie is actually cute in real life - how did they make him look so nerdy?	5.0	Funniest Movie of ALL Time	2005-05-05	3	2	1

The price was great and I even got a NP devotional to go along with it as it is part of a high school graduation gift for my son. It will be fun to own. We just watch it over an over. You'll either love this movie or hate it. If you hate it, it is because you don't &#34;get&#34; it. I have to laugh at the reviews that say &#34;the actors can't act.&#34; Really? This isn't a drama.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL	Little Miss Cutey	You have to have a weird sense of humour to enjoy this.  I do, and so I did.  It's a little strange and slow, but it's a black comedy and won't appeal to everyone.  Everyone is deadpan and secure in their nerdiness.  It's such a bizzare movie, I can totally understand why it has a cult following.  His friend Pedro stole each scene.  He was hillarious.  He wants to become class president and runs against Halie Duff's character, Summer.  Napolean saves the day when after giving your election speech, it needs to be followed by a skit of some kind, so Napolean dances to Canned Heat and is so funny.  Needless to say, he wins the crowd over and Pedro is now elected.I took off a star because there are definately parts where it is slow and stretched out to much, but overall, if you like obscure comedies, then check this out.  It took me a while to see this, but I'm glad now that I have.	4.0	Quite good :-)	2006-08-06	3	2	1

So finally I got a video of this movie, expecting a laugh riot.  Except that I didn't laugh or smile once.  The story was confusing, the acting was awful, the characters were all unlikable and unsympathetic, and there was neither tension or wit, or even any reason to stay interested.  I only waited through the end because I was wondering when I'd find the reason everyone thought it would be so good.  I never found it.Seeing all the positive reviews here, I could not help but being reminded of a ""Candid Camera"" episode where one person tells a joke that makes no sense, two actors laugh uproariously at it, and we wait to see what the reaction that the ""mark"" will have.  I can relate to ""the mark"".  Also, one man I talked to told me that he found this movie funny as a kid, but as an adult he couldn't figure out why he had thought that way.  I get the impression that people say this movie is supposed to be funny because they're supposed to, even if they don't.If you're looking for a ""dumb humor"" movie, I recommend ""Dumb And Dumber"" instead.

I won't go into plot detail - the amazon review of it describes it perfectly.  It's one of those movies you will either love and watch again and again, or detest. Suffice it to say, that only those with a capacity to appreciate subtle, abstract humor will appreciate it.  I am speculating that an artistic mind - writers, artists or the eccentric among us are going to appreciate this clever production.  Also noted are fun cinematography and hilarity from mundane experiences.  If you are simple, do not watch this flick - it'll bore you and prompt you to write a contradictory and ill-informed refiew.

I had heard some great things, so naturally I had to see it. What a disappointment. I found my self smiling twice, and laughing only once, and that was a completely banal scene where Napoleon's attempt at a bike jump results in the ramp crumbling uder him and him crashing. Point is, it had nothing to do with the story, and could have been in any film.The only saving grace, and in my opinion the only scene worth watching, was the climax, which sees Napoleon defying his nerdiness to put on a great dance routine.I didn't expect much going in; after all, it's an MTV movie. But I have to say: given the choice, I'd watch Beavis and Butthead 10 times out of 10 before Napoleon."	1.0	Terribly disappointing	2005-03-09	14	4	10
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A22RY8N8CNDF3A	"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist"""	"As an adult over 60 I was not sure if I wanted to see this or not, but it was highly recommended by younger friends, and caught my attention at the beginning. Not only was it ""retro"" but it had meaning of life throughout - everyone wants to be needed, respected, safe and loved. At first I was not sure what all the ""cheese"" and milk and cows had to do with the story, but it becomes clear later on the meaning. All the ""Steak Action"" is with Uncle Rico and always associated with unpleasantness. Cheese somehow signifies happiness in this film.The story is about the title character, Napoleon Dynamite, who lives in a small rural town with his grandmother and 32 year old shy bachelor brother. Napoleon is a high school student that most of his peers consider weird. His brother is in his 30's and lives in on-line chatrooms. The grandmother taking care of Napoleon and his brother is injured in a dune buggy accident and sends Uncle Rico to take care of Napoleon and his brother.Napoleon's Uncle Rico is another quirky character their caregiver and ""flim-flam"" man. Always with different schemes to make a buck. Napoleon finally starts to look at life a bit differently when he befriends a new student,Pedro. Pedro is satisfied with his life and comfortable in his own skin. He is not afraid to take chances, ask girls to dances, and run for class president.This is definitely a movie aimed at teenagers, but I got a lot of laughs and meaning out of it. The ending is very touching and sweet. This is the type of a movie you can watch several times and take away something new."	5.0	Funny	2007-09-23	4	4	0

Yes, I laughed a little bit, some scenes were very fun... but... the guy is so dumb that instead of laughing I was getting upset. I'm kind of dissapointed. Maybe I heard too many good comments about this film that I was expecting too much. My husband bought the DVD without watching it first based on the good reviews. We both watched it together and then we both regret the purchase, so if you are planing to buy this DVD without checking the movie first, I recommend you to rent it and then decide if you really want to buy it.

The film starts in a kind of surreal, hellish high school a la ""Heathers.""  The petty tyrants in the administration and cool caste maintain a rigid structure that allows no soul to breathe.  It's oppressive, and completely uncharasmatic kids like Napoleon and Pedro bear the brunt.  I don't want to ruin the end, but Napoleon unleashes his soul with the geek-funk without resorting to Columbine-style violence.

They're not flawless, but they have heart, and a genuine point of view.  They are the real deal.

Who can resist the promise of respite from the juggernaut of drek crushing the minds and souls of the multiplex patrons?What a complete disappointment. Other than the opening credits sequence, this movie has not a one redeeming quality. I hate to paint broad brushstrokes and subject people to simple labels, but I simply can't help myself here. This move is liked only by people who take delight in being different and counter-cultural JUST BECAUSE. The reason why I can say this is that I used to be like that.But then I grew up. Just because it's ""not Hollywood,"" does not make a movie de facto good. This movie is a textbook example of that principle. The diaglogue is inane, the characters are underdeveloped, and every joke--every joke--falls flatter than a Euclidean plane. When you have to try this hard to be clever, you aren't.The irony is that Napoleon and his buddies wear a constant expression of boredom and ennui. Ostensibly, this is a result of their environment.

For anybody who tried so hard to be cool (especially around your family) and look back now and cringe at the way you acted, you should get a kick out of this movie. Be advised, the humor is very dry...nothing like the comedy you find in Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller movies.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A7TLQEV65OZ2Z	"Maria A. Devries ""xotty"""	"This film has generated a notable divergence opinion: Sundance audiences laughed, but Ebert poo-pooed; my brother-in-law returned it 15 minutes in and rented something else, my sister and I laughed all the way through; some have longed for a time machine to get their 86 minutes back, others wanted one so they could go back and watch it for the first time again.  My theory is that the people who were popular in high school are the ones who hate it and those who weren't, love it.  It's often the popular kids' stories who get told, but this film is narrated from the perspective of Napoleon Dynamite, one of the truly original characters in the history of film.  The conventions of film narrative are secondary to characterization, but the film does not choose to portray the conflicted lives of the hotties, but the tortured lives of the high school B crowd: Napoleon and his friend, Pedro, and love interest, Deb, are all strangely peculiar but also representative of the communal ostracism suffered by the unpopular kids in almost any American High School.  The film starts with the hilarious image of the stoically individual Napoleon and just gets funnier and funnier as we get to see all the offbeat mannerisms that make him who he is: he curses the popular kids who taunt him with an exasperated, ""Geez!,"" he is blissfully unaware of the existence of fashion, he seems dimly aware that he is somehow the object of ridicule at the school, but does nothing to alter that perception.  As viewers, we are not laughing at his expense, but at his total lack of inhibition to express himself exactly as he is, not as who he thinks others would want to see.  This scares the popular kids and that's why some of them did not like this movie."	4.0	The movie popular kids hate	2005-05-09	5	4	1

I mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie. And this from a reviewer who called this movie racist--talk about hypocrite!Quite frankly, I thought this movie was hilarious. The acting is supposed to be life-less. The movie is supposed to be uneventful. But if you pay attention to the nuances, the slight glances, you might understand a bit more. For instance, when Napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in, he does so with the utmost care and then, he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed. For all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $1 an hour. Now who can't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario?I am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you don't, either you are a literal or figurative thinker, either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear. The point is you don't HAVE to like this movie. No one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee! You also don't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it. Liking this movie does not mean I don't like other more classic/mainstream comedies. Young Frankenstein, The Birdcage, The Producers, The Wedding Singer etc are all great movies and great comedies.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"This movie is like infinity times better than the last million movies I've seen.  You should definitely quit chatting with babes on the internet and check it out!What happens when you take a cast of unknowns (except for one actor who's biggest other parts were in ""The Country Bears"" and playing Jethro in the movie of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") and combine them with a script about high school geeks where the entire plot could be described in 3 sentences?Magic happens.Jared Hess and wife Jerusha co-wrote the script and John Heder brings to life  Napoleon Dynamite, an awkward Idaho high-schooler who is sooooo far from cool.  He is tall and gangly, all knees and elbows with an unruly mop of orange hair. Like all teenagers, he has dreams about being more than he is, but poor Napoleon is so far from the mainstream that he doesn't bother dreaming about things your average teenager fantasizes about.  When the other kids dream about going to the major leagues, becoming a movie star or getting into medical school.  Napoleon would be satisfied to have ""computer hacking skills"" or ""numchuck skills"".  Like a lot of high-school geeks, Napoleon spends a lot of time drawing fantasy pictures, and because he's Napoleon, they're not very good.  Unlike the geeks in, for example, the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" movies, Napoleon is so clueless he doesn't recognize how far out of the mainstream he is.  At one point he decides to impress a girl by drawing her portrait.  He gives her the pitiful drawing and tells her ""I spent like three hours doing shading the upper lip. It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.""In the universe of this movie, Napoleon almost fits right in, because his family is dysfunctional in the extreme.  (There's never even a mention of his parents.) Napoleon lives at home with his thrill-seeking grandmother and 30-something loser brother, Kip.  In many ways Kip is more pitiful than Napoleon because he's had an extra dozen years or so to develop into... a guy who spends all his time on the internet ""chatting with babes"". (One of the best sequences of the film comes later on when his online girlfriend, LaFawnduh, actually takes a bus out to the middle of nowhere to meet Kip.)The film is populated by other lovable losers like Pedro, a dull boy who imagines that he can get the most popular girl in school to like him if he bakes her a cake. Uncle Rico, another odd family member, comes to babysit Napoleon (and 30 year old Kip) after Grandma is injured in a scene that couldn't have been better if Larry, Curley and Moe had been in it.  Uncle Rico dwells on his high-school football glory, when his team WOULD have won the big game if the coach had only put him in at quarterback.The allure in the film comes from the characters, their situations and especially their language.  You just have to SEE it to get the magic in lines like ""Hey, Napoleon, what are you gonna do today?"" ""Whatever I feel like I wanna do. Gosh!""This movie is lightning in a bottle.

The slightly exaggerated characters bring to life a heart-warming tale of friendship, hope, acceptance and love. And they do it in a side-splitting fun way.Before I purchased the DVD to watch with my daughters, I heard so many people saying ""it has no point."" Yet, I found it to have not just one but several quite hard-hitting foundations. Rex Kwon Do, the quintessential martial arts sensei sums it up at the trial lesson...""at Rex Kwon Do, we use the BUDDY SYSTEM. No more flyin solo...you need somebody watchin your back AT ALL TIMES!"" Following that day, we see the ""buddy"" system come together as three loners start watching each other's backs.I knew Napoleon, Pedro and Deb in high school. It's all about the buddy system, someone getting your back, and you getting theirs.There are so many quotables it's hard to start. Every character comes to life and even Rex Kwon Do and the greasy Uncle Rico are able to work their way into your heart. We've watched it maybe ten times so far! The seventies retro stuff is absolutely a scream if you remember it.Jared Hess has created an interesting film with the very essence of the ""indy spirit"" yet with the unusual ability to go mainstream. Napoleon is a classic comedy with a heart that will  cross generations. And how refreshing-they pulled it off in 2005 without one curse or profane word, without sex, and no violence!Oh, and let those credits roll-don't turn it off.

While this comedy isn't for everyone, it was for me.Napoleon Dynamite lives in a cow town with his grandma and his thirty-something year old stay-at-home brother Kip.  Napoleon hasn't got much going for him besides his own imagined ""skills"" and a tremendous imagination.  When his grandma gets injured on a day trip, Creepy Uncle Rico comes to take care of Kip and Napoleon.  Add to that Napoleon's accidental friendship with the new kid, Pedro and you've got a recipe for a fine little tale that involves a rip-off time travel machine, disco dancing, true love (over the internet), suit shopping at a thrift store, and chicken farming.  The music collected for this film is eclectic and light.  The soundtrack - with sound bites taken from the movie between songs - is a precious addition to the film.Doesn't sound like much?  That's the magic.  The ""high point"" of the film is a risky run for class president.  But along the way, Napoleon gets to demonstrate his odd sort of faithfulness to his friends and a willingness to dare to dream.Oh, and listen to the commentary on the DVD.

Anyone who disagrees should just get out of my life and shut up!Anyone who loves off-the-wall comedy will enjoy this movie. I had never heard of this movie until a buzz emerged, that it was a movie you could quote all day. As a lover of comedy dialogue, from Caddyshack to There's Something About Mary, I could not pass up the opportunity to annoy my coworkers with some fresh one-liners.This movie is not Adam Sandler/Saturday Night Live funny, it's not Farrelly brothers 'gross-out' funny, and it's definitely not Woody Allen 'thoughtful' funny. It's Kids in the Hall 'weird' funny, but the humor is also very light, very innocent. There is not a single phrase of profanity spoken the entire film. Once you understand the movie's vibe - if you're not laughing after the first scene on the school bus, then forget it - you'll never want it to end. I had the movie for a week and probably watched it 10 times (and I work full time and go to school at night). Some, in fact most, of the lines are so dumb they're funny.Napoleon is the ultimate nerd. He's such a Poindexter, that even the 'cools' don't know what to do with him. And his gang are all characters who have been alienated, usually by choice, with the exception of Uncle Rico, who blames his failure on something his high school football coach did back in '82. If you were ever picked on in school, ever been ridiculed or teased for ANYTHING, had ever felt lonely or unpopular, then you will identify with Napoleon. If you were a bully and pushed people around, then you'll definitely remember Napoleon!Yes, this movie basically has no plot. There is no army to defeat, no bomb to diffuse, no girl to seduce. It's a slice-of-life movie where it doesn't matter what happens - we've only been given a window into this bizarre world. And a window is all we'll need.I was surprised when some of my ""hippest"" friends thought this movie was terrible. Shocked when one told me she turned it off halfway through, and saddened when others told me they just didn't get it. One the other hand, nothing makes me happier than hearing Napoleon being quoted at work, school or out in public. It's like you can exchange Napoleon lines with complete strangers and laugh with the knowledge that you're `in the know.'People don't like this movie, sure. But they seem to be the cynics who overanalyze, and expect every movie to change their life. Napoleon Dynamite isn't about sweeping the Academy Awards, or appearing in the Top 10 of all-time movies.

I can't understand why anyone could say this movie is trash, unless you have no sense of humor.  Just listening to anything Napoleon says is funny...his pickup line is ""Are you drinking 1% because you think you're fat, because you're not...you could be drinking whole milk if you wanted.  By the way, you should come get your stuff out of my locker, I can't fit my nunchucks in there anymore.""  That's not even the funniest scene.

During this same period, he meets a shy girl from school that he becomes close to and develops an interest in. His brother, Kip, meets a woman online that he believes is his soulmate.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A25ACLV5KPB4W	"Matt Hetling ""Matt"""	This isn't a movie to over-intellectualize or read into. This is a movie to enjoy.Napoleon Dynamite is about a high school student who is the geek of all geeks. Breaking with Hollywood tradition, this Napoleon isn't appealing because he's misunderstood, or because his heart of gold is continually tramped on by school bullies. The whole appeal of Napoleon is that he's completely and utterly pathetic.His interests range from nun-chucks to the Loch Ness Monster to drawing bad pictures. He is intimidated by the school bullies, but cruel to those who won't retaliate against him. He is completely self-centered, and his self-serving ulterior motives are completely transparent.Napoleon lives in his rural Idaho home with his dramatically older, and seemingly mentally handicapped, brother Kip, who spends all day chatting on the internet to women. Usually, they are cared for by their grandmother, but she has been called away unexpectedly, and so they are supervised by their uncle, who is constantly reliving his non-glory days on the high school football team and trying to sell tupperware or other things to the local housewives.There's not much of a plot to this movie; it's mostly just a string of intensely hilarious scenes which feature Napoleon or the quirky members of his growing world. Toward the end, a plot evolves out of a race for school president between Summer, the popular girl, and Napoleon's only friend (and seemingly the only Mexican student).The 11th hour vindication seems like a cheat, but at least Napoleon isn't carried away on the shoulders on a wave of newfound popularity. Instead, he finds someone to play tetherball with, and this quiet triumph is a good place to end it.This movie will stick in your mind, and Napoleon will stay with you in the same way that the Billy Bob Thornton character in Sling Blade does. He is so bizarre, and yet so like someone you went to high school with, that he is impossible to forget.Most of all, the inventive and hilarious character-driven jokes will crack you up. If you're going to rent one movie this year, make it this one.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AQ93SGEI1YDK4	Matt Montoya	"Napoleon Dynamite is a story about a stupid kid, his stereotypical mexican friend Pedro, and a slightly more smart girl. If your wandering what the movie is about, it's about nothing. No plot or anything. It's very stupid. I heard everyone saying it's the greatest movie on earth. I saw it and there were about 50 scenes that tried to make you laugh, and I only laughed at 3 (Napoleon get a steak thrown at his face; his uncle says ""Get some pampers for you and your brother"":the scene with Pedros cousins). Other than that, you might get a smirk at all the other scenes.If you truly love movies, don't watch this. If you truly like comedies, you might like this.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2KGCCG8QU6WC	maxbrod	Destined to be a minor classic in its genre, Napoleon Dynamite is a film that seems effortlessly made, yet in fact manages the difficult feat of endowing these characters with affection, making their ineptness and fallibility, and ultimately, vulnerability, a reflection of our own. They are, in the end, thoroughly human, and that's why this film succeeds beautifully in making us laugh, not with smugness, but with recognition and empathy.	5.0	Right on . . . right on.	2005-03-07	3	2	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2XCM3TUQ0FWXI	"Maxites ""Diocrides"""	"Once again I'm reviewing another movie that was completely overrated.  Completely overquoted.  Napoleon Dynamite is a movie about a nerd, his nerd brother, and his 2 nerd friends.  It's an original idea and has a different feel for it than most independent films and is, i grant you, better than quite a few indies, but overall it just WASN'T that good.  If you're one of those people sitting there saying, ""Hey it won MTV movie awards best movie of the year!"" ... give me a break.  This movie was MADE by MTV, of course they're going to give it a better rating than anyone ELSE in the WORLD.  Not to mention MTV is just a ridiculous channel anyway, MUSIC television anyone?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1S391PZP1HCAB	"Max Whipple ""guyinthetv"""	It makes me laugh to read reviews of movies peppered with poor spelling and the term 'worst movie I have ever seen.' These two things, to me, indicate two possibilities; a) They are either young and have no scope of cinematics to be making ANY judgement on ANY film. b) Just plain cannot relate to something due to (a).If you cannot relate to this movies' quirks, which have so many parallels to reality, then you just simply won't understand the humor. For the people who been immersed in the clique-laden world of high school elitism, this movie will draw laughs from familiar situations with stereotyped characters. The fact that every character fits so neatly into their preconceived societal niches' makes this film hilariously nearsighted. The shallowness and superficial world of a high schooler is captured perfectly through the eyes of Napolean. Overall, this movie accomplishes what it was meant to do; show you a familiar setting through unfamiliar eyes, giving Napoleans' self absorbed, and warped perception of it many comic translations.-GuyintheTV'All judgements are final'	5.0	Over your head?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A11NWCTRGXGC5G	"M. Bringhurst ""phunkman7"""	I must say, there is no special effects in this movie, no known actors, no real moral to the story or anything that would make you want to read a novel version of this plot.  That said, I must say this is my favorite movie of 2004, and quite possibly the best movie of 2004.  The beauty of this movie is the fact that it didn't have to rely on any special effects, turn in plots or points it was trying to make with the viewer.  This movie is pure genius.  My uncle hated this movie.  After many viewings and a lot of thought I can come to only one conclusion why.  He is shallow and close minded.  If you don't have a broud sense of humor, or appreciation for every little thing that make a movie great, then you better skip this one.  Jon Heder (the actor who played Napoleon) is not like this in real life, in fact he's married and quite down to earth.  In this movie you never once find him even close to out of character.  Yeah this isn't a drama, but the acting it incredible.  The whole cast is convincing to the point that you forget they are acting and in your mind you can't picture them any other way.  This is one of the most original films I have ever seen.  I love everything about it.  It's back to the basics film making with this movie, like when movies had to rely on acting and a great script, not like many of todays over priced CG reliant films that are so common these days.  Pick this dvd up, its full of great extras that fans of the movie will enjoy.  Bottom line, this movie will make you fit your nun chucks back in your locker.	5.0	if u didn't like it, then go eat a decroded piece of crap	2004-12-25	8	8	0

Trapp	"I was told by many people that you have to accept this movie on its own terms, that it doesn't have much of a plot, and that it is rather pointless. The prospect of this is did not excite me, as such a movie did not seem to lend itself to the kind of cultural analysis that I enjoy subjecting to everything I watch. It turns out this isn't entirely true. I guess you could see this film as a postmodern character study or a statement about the strange psychological development of an eccentric adolescent. But of course if I did that then it would betray the very thing that the movie is about, which is: not much. It's basically a movie about a goofy kid who comes from a goofy family who incessantly does and says goofy but hilarious things. I can see now how this movie has gained cult hit status in such a short time, with college students everywhere quoting their favorite lines. Mine is, ""Yeah hold on ...

Instead, from start to finish, it just makes you laugh with it's subtle, situational humor.In short, it's a story about life in ""cow town"", Idaho. Napoleon Dynamite is a geeky teenager who is on the outside of the social circle, and is perfectlt happy there. He and his new friend Pedro deal with the issues of their High School life including girls, acceptance, family, and everything in between. With Napoleon's Uncle Rico thrown in, as well as some of the other characters like Rex Kwon Do and Pedro's cousins with the ""sweet hookups"", this movie is a classic that makes you laugh all the way through. I was not only pleasantly supprised by this movie, I bought it as soon as it was available, and have seen it countless times since.I've heard a lot of people simply state that they think the movie is just ""wierd"" or ""boring"". The humor in this movie is abundant, but it might be a bit dry for some tastes. To me, there is nothing boring about this film. It's a classic that I will treasure forever. I hope that if you have not seen it already, you will watch it once to give it a chance.....it's more than worth it."	5.0	Best movie of 2004, very funny.	2005-05-11	7	3	4

Davies ""The Mattman"""	I finally took the time to watch Napoleon and I have to say that I enjoyed this movie more and more after the fact then when watching it.  My brother got it and I watched it one night while he was at work and sat there stratching my head the entire time.  When he came home we started talking about the film and he and I realized the same thing, more of this movie sticks with you then you think and then when you go back to watch it a second time you catch even more.  I say go rent or buy it and watch and see if you get the same reaction but after I watched the movie and started talking about I liked it more then when I watched it.Couple things about watching it, it is very monotone.  No characters in the movie seem to speak up or at a higher level then the next one.  I didn't really see this until my second time watching the film.  I am still unsure when this movie takes place.  Everything has a look and feel of being around the late 80's but there are more modern references and music so I have assumed that it is like that because they live in such a small town.  And the one thing that REALLY surprised me was that there was no curse words.  I have no problem with language but I actually found myself looking for one in this movie while watching a second time around because I was so surprised there were none.Great film will watch again and is now part of the library.	4.0	If At First You Don't Like Watch and Watch Again	2005-03-09	4	4	0

I sat watching it this morning, after getting up, and thought ""Why?"" But it's also one of those films that sucks you in, and then spits you back out at the end. I ended up half way through, not liking the film, but not wanting to switch it off either. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt, and ended up wasting my time.Why did I hate this film so much? Probably cos I recognised the lead character, and many other viewers will. There is a Napoleon Dynamite in every school. He's the guy who's not quite grown into his limbs yet, and can't quite work them. He doesn't really have a strong family background, and that reflects into his daily life. He has no friends, and no girls appear to fancy him. Mainly because he needs a serious makeover, contacts, a decent hairdresser, and braces. Poor Jon Heder must have been sick of that dazed look by the end of filming. And even the friend he makes, Pedro, he adopts the same look towards the end.Also, his 'uncle' Rico, was a complete & utter sleaze. Ladies, while watching this film, you will hate this man. Hate him with such a passion, you will want to make sure he never reproduces. Ugh. He does kinda get his comeuppance, but who's the chick on the bike?I actually thought Napoleon's brother was quite a sweetie, and although his attire looked really stupid towards the end, it was better than what he started out with!I'm really sorry to say that I didn't like this. It's one of those films, you've read so many good reviews about it, you WANT to like it.

I think this movie is a great example of how it does not take a big film budget to make a clever very funny movie. I won't wreck the movie for you, but I can't imagine anybody keeping a straight face during the class president skits near the end. Just the thought of that scene has been cracking me up for weeks.

Sherry ""Il Pazzo"""	"""I listen to hip-hop, dude."" - Jared HessJust the sort of transparent, sophomoric drivel you'd expect from the director of a film whose horse-power (or Pegasus-power, more likely) is a high-school weirdo that sketches mythic beasts and fancies himself a paragon of athletic prowess on the tether ball court.  What semblance of a point that exists revolves, presumably, around Napoleon's home-life - with 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) training to be a cage-fighter and human steak-vacuum Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) - and his social-life with Hispanic friend Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and shy glamour-shot photographer Deb (Tina Majorino).  On the domestic scene, Napoleon clashes bitterly and dorkishly with his Uncle Rico who is there to baby-sit him and Kip while Grandma is in the hospital.  The myriad of pseudo-plots include Kip's online love affair with LaFawnduh (""Well, things are getting pretty serious right now, I mean chat online for two hours every day""), Uncle Rico's torture over what could have been if Coach had only put him in for the Fourth Quarter back in '82 (""I'd have gone pro in a heartbeat, I'd be makin' millions of dollars and livin' in a big ol' mansion somewhere""), and the high-stakes, fast-money business of Tupperware (""Ya see, this ain't your run of the mill crapperware"").  Socially, Napoleon conspires to have Pedro Sanchez elected class president despite the efforts of the popular blonde Summer.Neither artistic nor anti-artistic, the film simply defies categorization.  Stupid, pointless, and totally lacking in anything resembling a redeeming quality, yet hilarious.  Yes, this is a funny movie after all.  Plot is hardly the point where Napoleon Dynamite is concerned, nor is creativity, unity, or anything else.  In fact, the absence of such things is the point itself.  Could anyone other than Heder have played the part so successfully?  My guess is no.  The actor appears to be exceptionally tuned into the awkward, shameless expressions, posturing, and utterances of the dorkiest of High School dorks.  The type of kid who couldn't say a cool word if Dean Martin himself rose from the grave and took a leisure stroll over to his house to give him a free lesson.Don't be surprised to see this one turn into a cult favorite, encouraging ""Happy-Hands Clubs"" the way Chuck Palahniuk's novel/movie inspired fight clubs and rivaling Caddyshack as a veritable reservoir of hilarious quotables.  Well, maybe not that big of a cult hit, but still.  The downfall being, of course, the obnoxious little dweebs that once championed the speech patterns of Beavis and Butthead and Ace Ventura who will now almost certainly deliver a Napoleonic corpse to an early grave because of their constant mimicry.

Tresca ""Talien"""	"I didn't really want to see Napoleon Dynamite, but had that sick curiosity reserved for rubbernecking on the freeway and reality television.  Then a friend let us borrow the DVD.Napoleon Dynamite is about, well, Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), a tall, frizzy-haired, spectacled geek of enormous proportions.  Napoleon is a new breed of nerd: The Angry Nerd.  Because he's not short, Napoleon is a little too powerful to routinely pick on.  Instead, he's randomly slammed into lockers or mocked in gym.  But Napoleon never curls up into a ball and weeps. He tells people ""SHUT UP! GOSH!"" or ""Freakin idiot!"" through half-closed lids. Everyone knows the Angry Nerd...he's voted Most Likely to Be a Serial Killer by his graduating class.To be fair, Napoleon never had a chance.  We're never told where his parents are, but he lives with his ATV-riding grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his painfully awkward older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip has a long distance relationship over the Internet with a woman known only as LaFawnduh (Shondrella Avery). Adding insult to injury, they own a pet llama named Tina and Napoleon has to take the bus to school with elementary kids.And oh yeah, his first name is Napoleon and his last name is Dynamite.Napoleon is also a gamer.  I submit the following evidence:Napoleon draws a manticore that he refers to as a liger. ""It's pretty much my favorite animal,"" says Napoleon. ""It's like a lion and a tiger mixed... bred for its skills in magic."" When faced with a job putting chickens in cages, he asks, ""Do the chickens have large talons?""Yep, that's a guy who plays Dungeons & Dragons all right.Or he would, if he had any friends.  Napoleon eventually makes one friend, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who is also ostracized at school because he's from Mexico.  The so-white-its-bright faculty and students constantly look down Pedro upon.  But Pedro is confident in his own subtle way.  He asks girls out by baking them cakes and most importantly, he plans to run for school president.Napoleon is not so lucky.  He openly admits he has no skills (if this were a more up-to-date movie, Napoleon would say he has no ""Mad Skillz""). Well, he has the ability to draw.  Unfortunately, he only THINKS he can draw.  His drawing sucks too.So Napoleon lies.  He lies about hunting wolverines, about his amazing martial arts prowess, about his non-existent girlfriend, about pretty much everything.  Since everything Napoleon says is utterly deadpan, there's no easy way to tell if he's lying.When Napoleon's grandmother has an ATV accident, his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with them.  There's a subtle irony here: Rico is a failed football star that is perpetually stuck in the 80s.  He is the ghost of the future, a vicious attack on all those high school jocks who would have gone pro if they hadn't messed up that knee.  Rico's entire life is driven by one goal: to travel backwards in time.  Once he discovers an expensive time travel kit on the Internet that will transport him backwards, he enlists Kip to join his get-rich-quick schemes.  First it's Tupperware, then it's...breast enhancement products.Yeah, Napoleon never had a chance.In the middle of this insanity, Napoleon bumps into Deb (Tina Majorino), dressed in full 80s attire and trying to sell her friendship bracelets so someone (her? Her mom?) can go to college.  It doesn't go well at first, but it's clear the two are destined for each other.Eventually, Kip meets LaFawnduh, a luscious African-American woman from Detroit.  Her arrival transforms Kip and the entire movie from then on, signaling a change from the 80s death by stagnation to an updated, hipper universe.  No literal time travel happens, but suddenly the movie shifts gears and its 2004 again.  And finally, all the characters begin some real emotional growth.Much of the movie's humor centers on the sympathy or disdain we have for characters like Napoleon.  A lot of the jokes are around mid-Western foils: the white town's reaction to an ethnic student, heavy usage of the word ""sweet,"" and farmers shooting cows (in front of a busload of schoolchildren no less). Not everyone will get the jokes.Perhaps more intriguing is the parallels between this film and Donnie Darko.  Both films have superhero-esque names, both take place in primarily white high schools, both feature racism against a different ethnicity, both have adults teaching kids confidence building skills, both have a serious 80s fetish, and finally both feature an obsession with time travel.  It's likely more people haven't made the connection between the two movies because few audiences have watched both.Unlike Donnie Darko, the broad parodies of white Midwesterners are smeared with racist undertones.  The two ethnic characters play to the most awful racial stereotypes: Pedro has a big family, scary relatives in pimped up cars, and is Catholic while LaFawnduh has long painted nails, lots of gold jewelry, and comes from Detroit.Throughout the film, the director (Jared Hess), makes liberal use of the buzzing sound of a fly.  It's a reminder that whenever we're laughing at Napoleon, we're the big jerks.  Which really argues the point that perhaps this movie isn't supposed to be a comedy after all.Ultimately, Napoleon Dynamite posits the question: what good ARE people like Napoleon?  He's angry, rude, insensitive, socially inept, and seems to be in a perpetual daze most of the time.  What ARE Napoleon's skills?We get the answer in a climactic frenzy of events that culminate in the class election. Pedro promises in his speech that he will make ""all your dreams come true,"" and in a sense, the film's conclusion is precisely that.Sweet!"	4.0	World Meets Angry Nerd (who plays Dungeons & Dragons)	2005-02-20	8	7	1

This movie is for those of us, like myself, who like to laugh at the geekiness and nerdiness of others.  Yeah, you may think that sounds kinda cruel,  but that's how life is.  As speaking as one geek in high school, I can honestly say that i even laughed at this movie.  I think everyone who thinks back to their days in high school, or currently attending school can relate to this, because we've all known a few ""Napoleon Dynamites"" in our day.This is the movie that throws the geek lifestyle out there for our amusement.  No, it doesn't go for the lowbrow jokes, dirty jokes, or outrageous setups for jokes.  It's the actions of the geek characters that provides the laughter.  So if you're one of those who can watch a comedy and laugh at the absurdity of it's characters for amusement, then get this.  If you need lowbrow jokes, setup jokes, lame jokes, dirty jokes, cheesy jokes, go rent revenge of the nerds.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2Y2XYDZGU9F95	Michael P.	"This movie has been compared to office space and rushmore.  The difference is that those movies are actually funny, while this movie is just stupid.  I have read a lot of these reviews, people saying that you need to ""understand a certain type of humor"" in order to ""get"" this movie.  What these people don't ""get"" is that this movie is actually a joke being played on them.  I am a big fan of subtle, sarcastic humor, and this movie contains none of that.  This was the most boring, worthless movie i have ever seen in my life.  Do not listen to the other reviews as they were probably written by a bunch of 13 year old idiots.  I saw a review where someone actually compared this movie to Seinfeld, because its ""about nothing.""  The difference is that while Seinfeld was in fact about nothing, there still were things going on, and there were plenty of jokes.  In this movie, there is absolutely nothing happening, and none of the dialogue is even remotely funny.  At times I felt like I was having a staring contest with people in the movie, because they weren't even moving or talking.  Just sitting there.  If that's your idea of ""subtle,"" then what you need to understand is that when something is subtle, there is an underlying idea or joke.  Things aren't just automatically funny because nothing is happening.  I also enjoy how this movie is already being called a ""cult classic"" even though it just came out a few months ago.  Maybe its because anyone that likes this movie only likes it so they can say tell all their friends that they are very cultured, have great taste in movies, and are in love with a subtle, dry ""cult classic"" because thats what MTV told them this movie was.  If you want dry humor rent wet hot american summer.  do not waste your time with this trash."	1.0	Terrible.	2005-01-05	24	10	14

There has been about 2 small chuckles from me, if you where sitting here youd think I forgot to open my mouth when I burped.Napolean is a boy living in a dull town, has a dull family, dull friends and for some reason it's tryin gto make a kid with a charisma bypass funny.I get it, ok, I do understand what it's supposed to be doing, but a whole movie dedicated to the same crap over and over is just a snore fest. Either I turned the thing off now or I would have gone to sleep and missed the paint drying session tonight.ND is the kind of charactor that should be a sub charactor in a movie. He should be a charactor thats in a movie, not the star of a movie. At least that way it might be funny to see unexpected things thrown in in-between scenes, that might be ok, but giving this moron a whole movie dedicated to a dork and his lifeless surroundings has made a movie that you'd have to be high off your rocker to think was entertainment.	1.0	ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz	2005-05-19	22	9	13

Once you're in this mood, watching Napoleon can be fun enjoyable, and full of laughs. From the start this movie exudes the kind of quirky and off-beat humor that makes you despise and fall in love with the characters at the same time. Their simple misadventures, in a way, make you appreciate your own life. When I first saw this movie on DVD, I turned it off after 45 minutes because it just seemed so stupid and lame. Then I realized though what this movie had to offer and I was able to find the humor in some of the parts of the movie and then I turned it back on and continued watching. This movie has a lot of ""1-liners"", which you will find yourself and others who have seen this movie repeating for weeks. I recommend this movie because it makes you laugh in a different kind of way. This plot-less comedy, while boring at first, will entertain you more than a lion and a tiger put together."	4.0	Stupid movies with no plot can still be entertaining	2005-01-12	3	2	1

I am not much of the going-outter since I have a strict mom, but nevertheless after months of seeing Vote for Pedro tshirts and endless quoting from my peers, I bought the movie on DVD and it surprised me. This movie is really a breather from the endless list of teenage high school movies about boy/girl lusting after girl/boy and what they would do to get there. Not to mention all the drug/alcohol/etc references made in between. This is not a love story, though there are romantic tie-ins, but simply, the dork of the school having to deal with a unusual family, mean bullies, and helping Pedro win the school election against popular Summer Wheatly. He is truly the kind of character that is unforgettable. Some people might not like it as much as others. Depends on your sense of humor.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3NCIN6TNL0MGA	"M. JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge"""	"I'm typically not fond of self-conscious low-budget ""independent"" films and was not expecting to like this film, so I was surprised at how much I loved it and at how funny the film is. Clearly, Napoleon Dynamite has escaped a lot of the independent film traps that make them so slow and amateurish. The question then is what makes this such a great film? First, there is the main character Napoleon Dynamite, a perfectly cast nerd who possesses a steely integrity and loyalty to his friends, which makes him sympathetic. This quality is necessary for the film's climax which you'll have to see for yourself. Secondly, the film does an excellent job of capturing innnocence. There is a purity to Napoleon's character that is infectious and endearing. This quality defies those critics who accuse the film of having no heart. The next great thing about the film is the hilarious anecdotage. The writer/director draws from his life in Idaho to create one comic scene after another without trying to be funny. Napoleon's droll, intense expression as he tries to navigate through girls, his competitive brother and his charlatan uncle is classic.One of the wonderful things about this DVD is the director commentary where scene by scene he shares his life experiences and explains how they informed his film.Napoleon Dynamite belongs to the Hall of Fame list of films about misfits: The King of Comedy (starring Robert DeNiro), The Good Girl, Adaptation, You Can Count On Me, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and Ghost World."	5.0	Nerd Chic Never Looked So Good	2005-05-27	8	5	3

Hey folks, it's just a movie and a funny one at that.  A lot of the humor can be subtle and sophisticated (which takes the movie beyond most of the under-13 crowd), but it is a well made film and pushes a lot of buttons as far as high school memories (especially if you were a nerd).One aspect of the movie largely unmentioned is the excellent soundtrack, particularly the ""Music for a Found Harmonium"" by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra which is heard after Napoleon's dance sequence.  I think the choice of this piece of music is inspired brilliance and is one of the best musical ""fits"" in movie history.  However, for some reason, this track is not included on the movie's soundtrack CD."	4.0	Hey, It's Just a Movie! (and a funny one at that)	2005-07-31	4	2	2

Again, because they have no politics, their films lack a point of view. Overall, it is so much stylistic and intellectual ma*******tion...They do all of this to perceive themselves as 'kewl'. They've taken us to the nadir of cultural and artistic expression, and have no clue they've done so.The GenX audience is quick to murmur or talk or in some way indicate - so others notice - that they 'get it.' Often comedy films are not funny, but GenX wants to indicate that they get where the joke was planted so they nervously laugh - as soon as possible after the punchline delivery, when what was said was simply not funny. And the characterizations in often self-absorbed and pretentious GenX films are less than a sketch most of the time. We are given a stereotype, or an outline of a character, and GenX as an audience accepts the draft as the final form. Again they indicate that they get it and can't be bothered with character development...GenX wants cartoon characters on-screen because they don't want to have an actual emotional reaction to fully developed characters...""Maybe I'm getting old.Maybe I don't understand the ""humor"" of Gen X, Y or Z.But funny?

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	"Life is normal for Napoleon Dynamite (played by John Heder.) Sure it is filled with downs, and very few ups, but he gets by.  Sure, he is the biggest dweeb this side of the Mississippi (for Easterners that's the other side.) Now, his brother nearly matches him pencil case for pencil case, but overall life is simple, and just a bit annoying for Napoleon.This film is filled with at least a few of the traditional high school stereotypes, and overall it is just the same ""average Joe"" story. Yet, this film focuses for once more on the nerd, yet without banding them together like in ""Revenge of the Nerds."" Instead, this small band of diversity even incriminates within, for a brief moment.I thought this film was ok, but the voice of the main character got on my nerves after the first ten minutes.  Plus, there's nothing really to the characters till the end, and by then it's all a simple wrap-up of the story. I would say the ending was too predictable, if it was not for the fact that there was no ""story"" of conflict until the end; everything else in Idaho up to that point was just average.I am too a fan of independent style films, but like some reviewers have said it is hard to actually care for the characters.  If you feel like it then buy the film; however, I would just view it once and see if it touches your retro-twanged emotions."	2.0	To Do: get beat up, lose lunch money, still be a nerd	2005-01-30	6	1	5

What several negative reviewers fail to realize is that not everyone is a beautiful pagent winner or jock with rippling muscles - perfect beings like most characters in contemporary movies and nighttime sitcoms are so BORING and overused.  At last, here is a movie about the weird, strange, deranged, and utterly REAL world that is as full of surprises as life itself!  Most movies today leave the viewer sitting behind a pane of glass, watching through the camera's eye and experiencing very synthesized, artificial worlds.  This one puts you there in Idaho, right into the twisted world of Napoleon Dynamite.  Those choosing to live in a fantasy perfect-world can avoid this movie.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A21G4TR1PBPS7H	Movie_Fan	I came out of this movie feeling extremely confused.All of my friends had seen it and almost all of them LOVED it, said it was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen.  Granted, this was before Wedding Crashers came out, but still.I didn't like it, but that's my personal opinion.I understand why so many liked it, I think it's a sort of catharsis, which is why people responded to it, even I responded to the character of Napoleon Dynamite.I admit, I found two scenes hilarious : when he tries to make a jump with the bike, and when he feeds Tina the Llama, which in my opinion is THE BEST character in the movie.Otherwise, I found it a tad dry, and actually a little offensive.Watching this movie is like watching a couple of weeks in the life of a high schooler on acid who feeds his llama tuna casserole, which while I agree that some of the humor is subtle, I didn't find it very funny.Or another view of the movie is that it's poking fun at mentally retarded kids with low IQ's, which is what Napoleon Dynamite pretty much embodies, which I find somewhat offensive, although i'm probably going a little to the extreme here.Personally, it's not a movie I enjoyed or would recommend, but it is light and if you have nothing else to do, why not?	1.0	ok, I'll give it 1 star...because i'm nice and feel bad for Napoleon.	2006-04-11	28	12	16

But within minutes of starting the movie even my 8 year old son said 'this movie is so dumb'.  Being the adult I can further understand more of the nuances of the movie...but I still had to agree with my son!  It was way overdone and if the boring antics had been toned down there would have been much more humor in them.  But this was a monotonous and extremely boring movie that we only watched till the end because we couldn't believe that people we knew had actually liked it, and hoped that at some breaking moment it would dramatically change and actually BE funny.

However, Napoleon and his bunch were much too flat.  If it was only Napoleon that was deadpan, then the quirkiness of the others may have worked. The uncle was the only interesting character.  About the only nice thing I can say is that Napoleon put forth a fairly accurate portrayal of a student with Asperger syndrome that also has some serious emotional issues.  He should have been picked on more at school for the film to be accurate.  I may use a scene from this movie when presenting on Autistic Spectrum Disorder because Rain Man was so overrated.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1SSNM2K7OOVCI	mrskippy	"""Napolean Dynamite"" is one of those films you need to watch a few times to truly appreciate. A single viewing isn't enough to enjoy this film. You need to see it through once, than watch again. After that, you'll likely enjoy this film forever.Perhaps what is so refreshing about this film is that it is a teen movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. The story is fresh and real. One can easily relate to Napolean Dynamite, the lovable loner who is the title character and focal point of the film. You can just as easily relate to Pedro, the new kid in school who Napolean quickly befriends and who becomes an integral part of the plot. All of the characters, with their various personalities and behaviors add to the film.In the end, you find yourself cheering for Napolean, Pedro, Deb, and the unpopular kids who are often ignored in the day-to-day life of teens. You can easily watch this film and look at the high school you attend or attended, finding each of these characters on campus. You can look around your neighborhood and find an Uncle Rico or a Kip.The film is a true delight and one that shouldn't just be rented, but purchased.

This movie is proof that Hollywood has run out of ideas and why the ticket sales at theaters is declining at a record pace.

Well if this is the stuff these brain-less, idiotic, can't read and write or count to eleven kids these days find entertaining, say goodbye to the country you love and your fore-fathers gave thier lives to protect because we are in serious trouble...to think these are the kids who will be running this country someday, or should I say, the kids who are going to RUIN this country someday. And we wonder why this generation has no drive, no will, no pride and no responsibility when we give them garbage like this movie to be ""entertained"" by. I just do not understand the obsession with this movie, it is awful. Maybe I'm just getting too old, and I'm only 32. Just think what the next generation is going to find ""entertaining"". Parents, it's about time you take some responsibility for you kids, don't let them see crap like this movie. The next time they talk back to you or don't give you the respect you think you deserve, do drugs, drink alcohol, have unprotected ""relations"", show that they have no manners whatsoever, only know who George Washington is because he is on the one dollar bill or flunk out of school, thank movies and T.V. shows like this one.

It is part Raising Arizona, part high school nerd story like sixteen candles.  The main character will leave you wondering...""what does that actor really act like in real life?""  Jon Heder plays the dislocated Napolean to such an uncomfortable nerdy T that you are hard pressed to imagine the guy acting like anything else.It will be hard not to laugh at a good bit of the dialogue in the movie especially when Rex's Kwon Do, says, ""Do you think anyone would want a roundhouse kick to the head when I'm wearing pants like these?"" in his MC Hammer baggy US flag pants.  The whole of the movie is so understated and quirky.  High School angst has an innocent face and you find yourself caring for the outcomes of Pedro, Napolean, and Deb's lives while laughing and laughing.Napolean's 32 year old live at home brother finds love on-line and Tawonda shows up via Greyhound and brings a whole new life to a once social recluse.  It is that innocence that nobody, regardless of their geekiness, is beyond the human connection and potential for happiness in the presence of others that utimately make ""Napolean Dynamite,"" such an enjoyable watch.You will be watching this one, listening for the lines, memorizing them, to repeat your favorite Dynamite lines back in the company of friends.

This film relies on sheer wit in creating its humour, which it certainly does not lack.  Napoleon Dynamite is funny in its own way.  It's the little things like the characters mannerisms and reactions that make this movie a sure cult classic.Napoleon Dynamite is a teen movie that throws all of the formulaic teen movie elements out the window giving this genre a fresh breath of life.  Ultimately it is the superb performances from the actors/actresses that make Napoleon Dynamite as great as it is.The premise of the movie is small town life shown through the eyes of anti-heroes.  And that is what makes Napoleon Dynamite different from other movies.

You've got people praising the movie with the highest rating, and at the other extreme, people calling the movie the worst movie ever made.  I happen to belong to the latter category.  I only watched the first 15 minutes of the movie, and then gave up waiting for something to happen.  The ""movie"" was plot-less, the characters flat and dimension-less.  It was like sitting in front of a wall and watching fresh paint dry.  Scenes ended with nothing happening, dialog rolling from the most boring of characters.I usually look for an Amazon review average of 4 or greater, reasoning that a movie that gets a low vote of 2 and a vote of 5 averages 3.5, which just glancing at the summary vote looks like a pretty good movie, but might be a real dog.Napoleon Dynamite at an average rating of 4.5 stars with 300 submittals is a mystery to me."	1.0	Puzzled	2005-01-03	18	7	11

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3NK0MVDYPGKXA	Nancy Kircher	"Do you ever feel like our world needs a well-written comedy that isn't driven by mindless sex or profanity? Well if you are, you've found the perfect movie! Here we have an independent comedy written/directed by rookie director Jared Hess who captures the true reality of a nerd who's life can't get any worse at this point in time.The movie starts with a cheesy (even though I'm OK with it being cheesy), opening credits sequence where there is a different background every 5-10 seconds, and you either see a plate of food with names written out of condiments, or names on pencils or sticks of Chapstick. After this you see Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), an afro-nerd who groans while waiting for the bus in Preston, Idaho. At school he draws medieval warriors/beasts, eats lunch with his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez), and is pushed around by the school bully. He then returns home to his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) who loves to chat online, and his grandma. Napoleon also feeds the family llama, Tina. So, that's his regular life, and the movie does a good job at establishing that in a comedic way in less than 10 minutes.The movie then starts to introduce more characters, like the stuck-up Summer Wheatley (Haylie Duff), the jock Don, Napoleon's uncle named ""Uncle"" Rico (Jon Gries), the nerdy Deb (Tina Majorino), and later Kip's soul mate Lawfanduh. Even though this movie has no central plot, it has some main events such as Napoleon's odd job on a chicken farm, Uncle Rico and Kip's salesmanship trek, the Preston High School dance, and the student council elections near the end. Throughout the film there are scenes of extremely random, yet hilarious humor that will live on in people's minds forever. One of my favorites in the movie is when Napoleon is pissed at Uncle Rico, so he throws a grapefruit at Uncle Rico's windshield, and is wrestled down by Uncle Rico afterward.The movie is basically a random joke comedy with no central plot, but in a sense it works for the film because it doesn't need one in this case. It sort of survives on its own, which most comedies usually don't. Cinematography is kind of boring because most shots are still and don't have much flair, but sometimes the camera shots move around a little in more active scenes. Besides that point, this is a great film for anyone because of the lack of inappropriate content, and the genius humor.The only true reason why this movie got a 4-star rating is because of the Blu-ray edition (the movie is 5-stars standing alone). The imagery doesn't exactly look HD because of the movie's very low-budget filming. Also, the special features are packed with content but every bit and piece of it is registered in standard-definition and in 4:3 full frame, not 1080p HD and 16:9 wide-screen like most other Blu-ray discs have. The 5.1 DTS-HD audio is incredible though...Still the same, if you haven't watched this movie, buy it from the website you're currently on!"	4.0	You're a flipping idiot if you haven't seen this!	2009-05-23	4	4	0

It has no plot and no characters who serve as anything but jokes.So it comes down entirely to whether you like the type of humor in it. My advice: watch the first 15 minutes, and if you haven't laughed really hard a couple of times by then, then don't bother, because you'll hate it. If this is your kind of humor though, you will love this movie. Like I did.	4.0	Hardly perfect, but original and well worth seeing for many	2005-02-27	2	1	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3EO01MD60DOMO	"Nathaniel C. Moffat ""Nat"""	Hollywood nerd movies tend toward a formula: High-IQ nerds suffer humiliation, approach despair, then organize to exact revenge on their jock-prep-cheerleader tormentors. If it worked for Revenge of the Nerds, why mess with success?Napoleon Dynamite offers an intriguing diversion from that formula. By abandoning convention (and plot), the filmmakers take you on an ultimately richer excursion into the world of ordinary nerds, a place where people dress just as badly, but prefer tetherball to programming. The filmmakers ratchet up the tragicomic tension, unfolding scene after scene of deadpan absurdity. It delivers the goods for your underdog-cheering habit, but gets there in quirky and unpredictable ways.Napoleon, Pedro, Kip, and the other characters aren't self-aware MENSA nerds from central casting. Rather, they are sad and sometimes abidingly strange, interacting awkwardly with one another while enduring headlocks, devastating put-downs, and sundry indignities.Through their humiliations, they exude the unsettlingly calm certainty that this is the Way of Things and always will be. You can see it best in their thousand-yard stares. Any actors could play this strictly for laughs, but here they almost suggest a state of -- go figure -- enlightenment through cluelessness.This is one of those rare movies that is enjoyable on a second or third viewing because you keep finding new details and angles. Recommended very highly.	5.0	Unsettlingly Hilarious	2005-01-12	12	10	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	From the start of the film, it is obvious that Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy that is not for all tastes.  Those who enjoy the predictable, low brow, gross out comedies like Old School or recent hits like Dodgeball will most likely get little enjoyment out of the film, but fans of films of Wes Anderson may find something to admire here.  Taking place in Preston, Idaho, high school student Napoleon (Jon Heder) spends his days either being ignored or ridiculed by his fellow classmates.  His family life isn't much better, with his free loading uncle in the mix and his older brother finding his soul mate via the internet.  Napoleon experiences other adventures, such as an ill-fated trip to the school dance, and helping his friend Pedro run for school president.  Oh yeah, Napoleon dances too.  The comedy is subtle to say the least, so don't go in expecting any laugh out loud scenarios.  Napoleon Dynamite isn't a bad film at all, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy, and some will even be annoyed at some of the film's pacing and style, but that aside it's still worth watching.	3.0	Not for everyone	2005-01-03	7	5	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ	Nicholas Carroll	"I'm surprised by the cult status and financial success of this film.  So many who claim to love this film, if they were honest with themselves would admit that they love laughing at the misfortune of others and looking down on people in order to feel superior, because let's face it...there are loners in high school who don't have any friends, so the people who love this movie so much...just how many loner/nerdy friends do you hang out with?  Just as I thought...none.I believe Roger Ebert is correct in his review of this film...it was made to make people feel superior as they laugh at some of the most pathetic characters to ever grace the silver screen.  The only likeable character in the whole bunch is Deb, though she could use some pointers on which direction her pony tail should go (towards the back, not the side).  This film is all over the map...as the clothing styles of the main characters are holdovers from the polyester and butterfly collar 70s; the interior of the house with wood panel walls and top loading VCRs also put this family in league with the Brady Bunch; the school dance plays classic 80s songs; yet we know its in the 1990s because of Kip Dynamite's surfing the Internet for babes.Napoleon Dynamite is an unlikeable nerd who doesn't have any friends, except for the new Mexican kid, who speaks with all the stereotypical accent of Slow Poke Rodriguez of the Warner Brothers cartoons (cousin of Speedy Gonzalez).  Watching this film, as painful as it is, it shouldn't surprise anyone why Napoleon is always picked on at school and has no friends and can't get a date.  His brother Kip is no better, hanging out at home with no job and getting involved in some salesman schemes when their used-car salesman looking uncle shows up one day with dreams of faded high school glory (""my life would be better if only the coach put me in the game the last quarter of the final game of my senior year!"").  Napoleon and Kip live with their grandmother, who disappears from the movie really quick, as even she can't stand to be around those losers and leaves them to fend for themselves in the cold, brutal, superficial world.Does this movie have a point?  Not really.  It succeeds only if you consider the idea that the director's whole point of this film is to indite us as having superiority complexes for judging and laughing at the patheticness of these characters.  A lot of the scenes have humor in them, and I can easily imagine it going over really well in the Mormon culture of Idaho and Utah, where this film takes place (Preston, Idaho).  That the director is a graduate of BYU, which censored Hollywood films when I attended there, doesn't surprise me, as this film was made to Mormon specifications of ""morality"" (no profanity).  Unfortunately, they don't have a prohibition on bad taste, otherwise this film would've never seen the light of day.Having said all that...its not the worst film I ever saw (that would be ""Barton Fink""...the only film I ever walked out of the theater in the middle of).  I loved the opening credit sequence, which I thought was the most creative I've ever seen.  I also thought the ending was so manipulative in that the choice of song was lyrically brilliant and I couldn't help but smile when the film came to an end.  That was aggravating to me...a film I consider in poor taste that ends on such a brilliant note that I can't call it a complete waste of my time.  There were two other points where the director used two of my all time favorite 1980s songs (""Forever Young"" by Alphaville and ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper), so I must add one star for the music selection of this film.  I also liked the Llama and wished to have seen more of that.  For me, the funniest moments of the film are with LaFawnduh and with Rex and his bodybuilding wife.  So, those characters saved this film from being a complete wash out with me...thus three stars instead of the automatic one that amazon.com gives all reviews."	3.0	A discomforting look at the lives of several losers	2005-03-08	8	3	5
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1LJFKIZ15WP32	Nicholas Doles	I like this movie mainly because I recognized way too many of the characters. A Napolean Dynamite went to every one of our schools. The nerdy guy who unlike the rest of the nerds wasn't smart. The poor kid who over compensated by glorifying the truly horrid.You know his brother. The hundred pound weakling who constantly claims to be working out and takes martial arts classes yet still gets beat down every day.And you know the uncle. The ex-highschool jock who wasn't all that great to start with but still finds his high school athletic days to be the high point of his wretched existence.There are definitely many movies I have laughed harder through, but the parts I found funny I found funny on an unusuall level.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1HGQBE8ZSI58	Nick Mackler	After watching this several weeks before this review, I finally brought myself to review this item. I have to admit, when I first watched it, I wasn't laughing. I knew it was funny, but for some reason it wasn't making me laugh. However, I looked back on the moments in the film, most of which I remember, and thought very fondly of them all. While most people will be praising the comedic side of this film, I was most impressed with the storyline and characters. This movie does have an obscure, rather odd plot. To quickly describe it, it's basically just a deep insight into the life of a nerd, that being the main character Napoleon Dynamite. Of course, from this unveils numerous side plots, the largest being Napoleon's friend running for Class President.I found the humour to be not filled wih hilarity, but quite suttle and witty. There are certain moments in the film that are especially funny, but no one stands out. The acting is strong, especially the lead role, and we get a great new style of comedy that few of us have ever seen before.Overall, this is a strong comedy, which is loved by most who see it. I recommend that any movie lover see it, and hopefull you'll appreciate it as much as I do. Definitely worth seeing.	5.0	Clever, Appreciative Humour (4.5)	2005-03-07	5	4	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A5FFAA5A3C398	Nixie Pie	"I decided to have a watch of Napoleon Dynamite after being told by many how ""great"", ""fantastic"" and ""wonderful"" it was.In great anticipation, I inserted the DVD into my drive and watched with my equally excited friend. We watched Napoleon's antics. Some were mildly amusing, but never ""ha ha"" funny. We watched his boring friend Pedro run for class president. We watched his weird brother become a homie. We watched the nerdy lady friend become happy. We watched a lot of stereotypes. None of which were humorous at all. We were both very dissatisfied with the film. I like lame humour, but this type was just pathetic. It's a ridiculously monotonous film with an uninteresting plot.Unfortunately, for Christmas my uncle decided to buy me something that all the girls at his work were talking about. He bought me Napoleon Dynamite on DVD. ""Thanks, I really love this movie,"" I lied.Me and my friend decided we'd give it another chance. Sometimes I like movies better a second time. Not Napoleon Dynamite. The only thing we giggled at was when Napoleon sulks, ""Idiot!"".This movie is lame and hardly a masterpiece. It is full of boring characters and pathetic stereotypes. In a way, it is just another teen movie. Needless to say, I sold my DVD a few days later. Very disappointing for such a hyped up film. Maybe I just don't get it.

Insanely stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. A lot of the humor of this movie is stupidly rediculous, but effective... and stupid. On the other hand, it's smart. The movie does a hard thing: character humor. Besides, if a movie about a HUGE nerd isn't stupid, it wasn't done right. I hope you watch this and laugh hysterically, like others have. If nothing else, you won't ever forget this movie. It's original smart AND stupid, all at the same time.

There were a few funny bits, but for the most part I didn't laugh at the places apparently I was supposed to.The odd thing is that . . . neither were they!  I've seen ""Holy Grail"" (for example) about a thousand times, and I still bust a gut.  Don't you laugh when Marty Feldman sticks his head out the door in ""Young Frankenstein"" and says . . . ""Blucher!"".  Yet, this Pedro crowd couldn't even muster a titter at the tater tots scene, or much else for that matter.

How terrible the movie really is.The film is 85 minutes of sophomoric humour without any real plot or empathy, but, it feels like hours of it. In terms of sheer quality, the film is worth passing up.2. The ideological harm inflicted by the film.After this film was released, its effect was that a lot of people started latching on to the idea of being an outsider. The only trouble was that most of those were the people who made most of the outsiders outsiders to begin with.If you want a vision of what that life was really like for the rest of us, check out Todd Solondz's brilliant and unflinching Welcome to the Dollhouse.	5.0	Terrible and Harmful	2006-10-01	9	0	9

I watched the first half hour or so, waiting for the funny, a plot, anything to sustain me through the movie.  Nothing.  It's just the beginning, I thought.  It'll be great by the end, just like everyone else said.So I waited. And waited. And waited. I waited until, finally, it was the end of the movie.I sat in amazement, wondering how anyone could like this movie.  The 'laugh lines' that everyone raved about weren't funny.  NO plot was ever really developed, and the movie never really finished.All in all, I would definitely say that this is the WORST movie I have ever seen, and that includes Glitter and the Spice Girls movie.

It also hurts a bit how true it is.  You can't just sit and laugh through this movie.  You can laugh but you have to feel for Napoleon; sympathize with him, be proud when he succeeds.

The elevator music inspired soundtrack goes hand in hand with the idiosyncratic outlook of the film much in the same way that Napolean's oddball look and language coupled with the film's drowsy ambiance reflect the main character's weirdo dorkiness.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ANP4A72YDTZJA	"OneManBand ""Bruce"""	"Napoleon Dynamite is definitely a different film than most of what is playing in theaters these days.  There is no superstar magnet personality to anchor the film.  Special visual effects are nonexistent.  At first glance, a strong narrative is lacking.  So, why would anyone want to sit through this movie?The characters in this film appear to be two dimensional, but there is more going on here than your typical high school movie.  The characters, setting and plot are trapped on a banal merry-go-round.  Scenes often include boring neighborhoods, thrift stores, mundane high schools, and uninviting tracks of land.  There is nothing in the scenery that is really appealing.  The protagonist initially appears to a high functioning autistic, lacking in all but the most basic conversational skills.  He is surrounded by other family members who are lost on the trailing edge of internet chat room and various get rich quick pyramid schemes.  So what makes Napoleon Dynamite appealing?  Napoleon's adventure is just to make it through the next day - his world consists of the geek high school companions, thrift stores and family members who are poster children for dysfunction.  Watching him navigate his culturally meaningless world was fun.  This movie reminded me of ""About Schmidt"", another movie filmed against a backdrop of large and empty spaces with characters all too much like what many of us live with on a day to day basis"	4.0	A Minimalistic Tour De Force!	2004-12-23	4	3	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2LTLXDXCTXE1T	Orlando Cruz	"Fantastic movie. Although made on a low budget, it combine fantastically unrealistic characters and makes the film into a lovable sequence of hilarious events. Highlights include: the Uncle Rico sequences; when he first meets Deb selling beadwork so she can go to college (your mom goes to college!); and very best the ending dance sequence. It has also sparked many catchphrases repeately heard around the high school, including ""Whatever I want, gosh!"" and ""Tina, you fat tub of lard, get some food!"".Along these lines, I also think that this film provides an intersting look on society in general. After I saw this movie, I went to school one day and saw the star football player and the blond cheerleader going down the hall saying ""Frickin Idiot"" and other miscallaneous ND sayings, and I just thought ""This is the most ironic thing that I've ever seen. These popular kids are quoting quotes from a movie all about nerds getting beaten up and made fun of every day, and they think it's cool. meanwhile, in the same school, I can name 2 or 3 kids that are being bullied and harrassed right now."" I think that this shows how some people can think that they believe in a subject or idea, but it turns out that they are just pretending. These homecoming king and queen don't care about the nerds at my school-they just like watching people like them in movies. Also, some of these reviews say things like ""After I saw the movie the 4th time, it started to get old"" Well duh. Then they would give the movie a 2 and write it off as another stupid comedy, when it is actually a fantastic work of art."	5.0	Practicing my dance moves	2005-04-14	6	3	3

However, the more time goes by, the funnier and better it gets! The deadpan, no-emotion delivery makes it a bit strange at first, but that is what makes some of the lines SO FRICKEN FUNNY! About the only folks who would find this movie un-funny would be the Summer-and-her-friends people of the world.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A30U40FUY9FI6W	Pachanga Jackson	In most American geek movies, the characters and we the audience are expected to accept that the characters are geeks and/or social rejects. In this movie that is not true. The characters do not believe there is anything wrong with them, and there really isn't anything wrong with them. The reason they are not suffering about their lot in life or their social position is because they don't think there is anything wrong with themselves, and thats true for Napoleon and the rest of the group in this picture. The beauty of this movie is that you watch it initially from the usual premise, but as it wears on you start to realize that the characters truth that they are fine as who they are is just as real as assuming otherwise.	5.0	How to get this movie	2006-02-27	6	5	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ABCQUA65LGRKK	Papa Ski	"I'll be honest.  I watched this movie a couple weeks back and still can't decide what to make of it.  It is such a different type of movie that you can't really place it in a certain category of movies.  It's almost like watch a funny documentary about an event which you know nothing about.  Being a college student I had been subjected to hearing a lot of quotes from this movie.  I had to watch it out of survival.  Now people are telling me that you really don't get it until you watch it a second time.  I'm not sure if I'm ready for that step yet.  Actually I'm not really sure that there is really anything to get.  I will probably try and find out.  I wouldn't advise buying this movie.  Most people have seen it and I don't think it is one you will want to watch all that frequently.  My advice is to rent or buy it used after all the movie stores get rid of their hundreds of ""guaranteed in stock"" copies."	3.0	Interesting	2005-07-10	2	1	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A24WSYSTSFWK03	Parker Ruiz	"I was surprised. From the tiny bits and scraps that I had seen of the movie, I was expecting another tired, flat, unimaginative film that took predictable swipes at the socially inept during their high school years. Instead, I found this film almost hypnotic when I wasn't laughing my head off.Napoleon Dynamite manages to poke fun at ""nerds"" while celebrating their uniqueness.Sure, the characters seem more like stagnant caricatures than real people. And though they remain so throughout the film (I dont remember ever seeing the Napoleon character ever crack a smile), their journey through the travails of high school somehow paints a human side that lured me into liking them. I discovered myself pulling for Napoleon and his pals while still finding it hard to resist laughing at them.The film feels fresh as it sidesteps the slick over-polished Hollywood look. The audience isn't bullied into predictable twists and turns by special effects or a foreboding soundtrack. Instead, Napoleon Dynamite's simple music and serene scenery nestles comfortably around the plot.If you're interested in seeing a film that depends on smart writing and clever (if not a bit off the wall)ideas, I recommend Napoleon Dynamite. The Hollywood whistles and bells are missing from this film. The good news is you won't even miss them."	5.0	feature length load of refreshing and funny	2005-03-01	3	2	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2MMWMUYWXGLMO	Patrick Allen	Save yourself some time and money, and never watch this movie. I love movies, watch them all the time, and am open to any type. I especially like comedies, and have a great sense of humor. I was told be numerous people that this movie was great, so decided to watch it one night. That was one of the longest nights of my life. The movie has absolutely no plot, and although some would argue the one-liners make up for it, in no way did they manage to even keep me awake for more than a few minutes during the movie. The jokes sound funny taken individually, but when combined with the lack of plot completely devoid of humor, anyone laughing would have to be trying to blend in with a crowd. If you absolutely must watch this movie, it's best watched with a group who can make fun of Napolean with you and possibly keep you awake for most of the time. To sum it all up, the only reason I gave this movie even one star is because it was the minimum choice.	1.0	Warning- Do Not Operate Machinery While Watching This Movie.	2005-02-16	15	5	10

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1ZOYQ41EGZJ7D	"Paul ""Pauli"""	"This movie reminded me of a 5-star movie, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", because of the colorful characters, strange family situation, western location (ND takes place in Idaho) and even goofy name. It didn't have quite the acting caliber (although Jon Gries turns in a great performance as Napoleon's shady Uncle Rico), but a lot of creativity went into this story about those awkward teen years in a typical American High School.The first part of the movie introduces the characters and their ideosyncracies and is a bit slow-moving. I found it to be very funny and careful not to be too over-the-top, e.g., the antagonists (mainly Uncle Rico and the popular gang at school) aren't portrayed as being the personification of evil, just annoying to Napoleon and his friends who are potrayed as average, nerdy high school kids trying to survive. They've all developed worlds of their own in which terms they frequently express their thoughts, e.g., Napoleon talks about needing ""great skills"" to get dates with chicks and how his favorite animal is a ""liger"" which is one he himself invented.The second part of the movie is the making of the class Presidential candidate, Napoleon's friend Pedro, who is the most unlikely of candidates. Newly-arrived in town, about all Pedro has going for him is that he's the only guy with a mustache in school. He's up against Summer, the most popular girl in school played by Halley Duff, who seems to hold all the cards. While I refuse to give the outcome away, I will remark that Napoleon plays the biggest part in the wacky outcome of the election.I was a little bit confused as to when this was taking place. My wife, who watched it with me and also enjoyed the film, kept pointing out the 1980's styles and music which seemed to make sense, but Kip has a serious online, chat-room relationship with his girlfriend which is definitely post-1995. This doesn't detract from the film much - they played ""Time After Time"" at the dance, one of my favorite '80s duets.It's refreshing to see a movie which involves kids without a lot of extreme grossness or with the kids being engaged in any type of vice other than some bullying and insults. There are some extremely funny scenes involving feeding the pet llama, jumping bikes and drawing less than flattering pictures of the girl you want to date. All the characters in the sub-plots enjoy happy endings, including the notorious Uncle Rico - there's no nasty revenge which sets this film apart from a lot of goofy high school flicks."	4.0	"Great ""west of the Mississippi"" movie"	2005-07-05	2	1	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AVPUU6DM5VLIA	PeterK	"On the surface it is a comedy of the ""pick on the nerd"" variety. But really it is an emotional showcase of why kids that are typically defined as losers are that way. I cried because the way that kid grew up is terrible. His parents are either dead or deadbeat(it is never fully explained), he lives with his grandma and his 32 year old brother, and he is constantly ridiculed. It is not his fault that he acts how he does, it is a result of an upbringing where no one ever told him ""I love you"". He does dumb things that people make fun of him for, but those actions are the product of a terrible childhood. Walking out of the movie theater, I wanted to verbally harass all those people that were making fun of his actions and words. Was it a funny movie? Yes, but it made me sick to laugh at such a poor human being. The movie was definately in the vein of Wes Anderson films. I would have thought it was a Wes Anderson film if it were more somber and less ridiculous in some parts. It was very reminiscent of Bottle Rocket and I wish it was more somber so people would not take it at face value and mock the poor kid. This movie should have been about feeling bad for Napoleon but instead it was laughing at Napoleon. There did not seem to be much emotional growth at all for any of the characters in the movie and that left me disappointed. If the director really cared about the characters he would have edited everything into more somber, less over the top scenes. Also, the bonus extended ending, while funny, was also too over the top.

I have become increasingly sensitive to that in my old age.I just see a lot of kids like Napoleon, I think most of us have been Napoleon, and it is sad. Maybe that's the point?

Sure, I got a couple chuckles here and there for the overall pathetic-ness of some of the characters, and the dance scene with Napoleon at the end of the movie is worth seeing, but I cannot pinpoint a single joke in the entire movie. The characters aren't loveable, and they're pathetic and exaggerated in their lack of energy, but there's also very little personality, and there's just no comedy in this film at all.Perhaps people who find this film funny relate to this Napoleon character and his small town... I feel bad for you!Keep in mind that some people who enjoy this film so much thought Anchorman with Will Ferrel was ""stupid"". I sincerely hope that people who share this opinion develop a real taste for comedy some day.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Napoleon Dynamite is one weird film.  You will find yourself laughing hysterically at times and completely bored at others.  There is no real plot to the film other than Napoleon's (Jon Heder) efforts to get his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) elected class president.  Napoleon lives with grandmother and his effeminate brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  After grandma is hurt riding in the dunes, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to watch after the boys even though Kip is 32.  While Napoleon is an outcast with no friends, Uncle Rico is the saddest character in the film.  He is desperately trying to recapture his glory days and even goes so far to buy a time machine that will take him back to 1982.  What saves this film from being a total bore is the immensely likable cast.  Mr. Heder is great in the title and everyone else makes their characters quirky but fun.	3.0	Sweet Movie	2006-06-06	6	1	5

The humor was also more memorable humor, and not the laugh-out-loud kind.  I actually find myself enjoying repeating Napoleon's lines more than watching the movie.  But the movie was unique, and there were a lot of characters involved, so things were at least decently interesting.  Overall, I recommend this to people who are looking for a different kind of humor than what is in the usual comedy movies.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2VN986E5KR1NV	ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen)	"This winning little low key comedy knocked me out with its subtle brilliance.  Director Jared Hess and lead actor Jon Heder have wrought a minor miracle with this low budget, big box office film, which is so deadpan that some folks perhaps completely missed the point.Like the delightful Christopher Guest projects A MIGHTY WIND or WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, this film definitely spoofs and caracatures its main characters; yet, it maintains a lot of affection for them as well.  The mood and atmospherics of the small Idaho town are spot-on perfect...it could be Anytown USA or any school.  Heder's Napoleon is a nerd for the ages. but he's also a tough survivor who's integrity and uniqueness gives him a thick skinned determination that makes you cheer when he succeeds.Napoleon's one liners and dialog are the stuff of legends.  I love his explanation of the ""Liger,"" and his unmerited pride in his art skills.Jon Gries as Uncle Rico is the perfect blend of oily sleaze, rockheaded idiocy, and pointless arrogance...and off-kilter menace.  His routine of filming himself passing a football is so idiosyncratic and pitiful that it had me rolling on the floor. Aaron Ruell as Kip Dynamite seems to be based on John Waters, except more hip and less gross.  Ruell is hilariously brilliant in a supporting role; he seems almost hateful and cold (and even nerdier than Napoleon), until he meets the hot mama LaFawnduh Lucas, played with a lot of spice by Shondrella Avery.  By the end of the movie, Kip is actually almost lovable.Then, of course, there is Pedro, who is actually a very cool cat.  He is portrayed by Efran Ramirez with a winning, shy-but-confident demeanor; his deadpan delivery also provokes a lot of mirth.  The movie wouldn't be complete without the lovely Tina Majorino, who plays Deb, a friend to Pedro and love interest for Napoleon (once he finally sees the *babe* Summer Wheatley for what she really is...a selfish trollop).Napoleon's dance at the end of the film has to be seen to be believed--it's pure magic.  You will, like his high school classmates, want to stand and cheer.This DVD has some really cool extras, including commentary and a short film.  The music in the movie is totally cool and enjoyable.  I believe NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a work of genius...a bit raw and unfocused at points, but a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging visionary work.  The acting and directing are inspired.One other note: this is a very clean movie and acceptable for family viewing.  It's proof that creativity wins out over gratuitous nudity and profanity and violence any day."	5.0	Vote for Pedro	2005-09-15	27	24	3

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A20U13MWC4WI0K	Pru	"""Napoleon Dynamite"" seems to be a movie that you either love, or love to hate. I'll admit, the first time I saw this movie, I didn't get it. Then I realized that there really wasn't much to get, which is what makes the movie so great. There's really isn't much of a plotline, but the hilarity of the characters makes up for it. From the set and costume design to the characters themselves, the movie is just plain funny. Another thing that makes this movie worthwhile is that it's capable of holding different meanings for different people. Some see it as purely comedic fun, others see it as a sort of coming of age story, and some people just don't see anything in it at all. However you feel about this film, you have to admit it's definitely one of a kind."	4.0	Napoleon	2005-10-05	0	0	0

"I'm glad that I haven't purchased that movied but rentedto see whether it is really good as some folks gave great reviews for that.I'll tell you honestly it was a waste of money!This movie is the most stupid movie I have ever seen considering that it is a new release and that some idiots gave a good review for that. No offense but only idiots can rate it as a funny movie.I was waiting for something funny during the whole movie but unfortunately that ""something"" never happened. There is one idiot guy named ""Napoleon"" who pretends to be a cool or funny guy. In fact he is not! He doesn't even deserve to be called an ""idiot"".If you don't believe me please rent this movie and decide for yourself! I can tell you, I watched this movie with three other people in the room but none of us was excited about it. I said ""what the heck is it"", where are those jokes mentioned by good reviews? And all 3 of us have good sense of humor, we are not idiots. But when you watch this movie you think that movie director treated you like you're an idiot.It doesn't deserve even 1 star.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A292YWWNFVSIWY	Publius	Napoleon Dynamite is one of the more interesting movies to be made in the last decade.  It is also a good representation of the newly fashinoned post modern hero.  Napoleon floats through life without any motivation whatsoever.  He takes pleasure in the small things in life like `chapstick' and drawing fantasy cartoon characters.  The screenwriter could have organized the plot around a long protracted battle between the nerds and the cool people.  Instead, nobody in this movie seems to care about who wins or loses this battle.  Except for the `Vote for Pedro' campaign, we are left with the notion that the `nerds' and the `dorks' are happy with their lot in high school life.  In fact, we are left to believe that Napoleon's involvement in Pedro's campaign is only to serve as Pedro's bodyguard.  So although Napoleon is focused, his focus is detached.  Uncle Rico, on the other hand, has an undetached focus in his life.  Unfortunately, his focus is on the year 1982 when his football team played in the State championship.  While Uncle Rico concentrates on the past, and Napoleon arguably concentrates on nothing, Kip is the only one that focuses on the future with his relationship and eventual marriage to LaFawnduh.  It seems Kip is the only one to break out of the family's monotonous existence.  The movie is also very family friendly.  There is no violence, no gratuitous sexual innuendos and no drugs.  Hardly the usual fare of the 18-25 year old cohort which has taken to this movie.  (An age group that may be responsible for the ubiquity of the Vote for Pedro T-Shirts)  With the momentum that this movie has gained, it may be considered the first cult classic of the 00's, even though the community in the film seems to be trapped in the 1980's.	4.0	Post Modern Hero	2005-11-02	8	3	5

Everybody has Napoleon's trademark ""God! Flippin' idiot"" on iPods and such. It was funny the first time. Now everyone's going around wearing shirts that say ""OMFG TATER TOTS"" and it's really starting to piss me off. I don't see people wearing shirts related to more independent, even cult, movies nearly as much.Also, it wasn't as funny watching this the 2nd time. In fact, it was really boring. Because ""Flippin' idiot"" isn't funny the 19th time around. Most scenes dragged out and the good scenes weren't as often as the annoying quotes.If you are a half-minded idiot who likes movies with half a plot (well, I will admit that's kind of like me) you will love this movie.

One has to actually think, ""Aha, so that happened because this happened,"" and not worry so much as to why the scenes seem unrelated.Another reason this flick gets thumbs down. It's too close to something that could actually be real, that would actually happen. Napoleon and his family, although disfunctional, are really quite normal. Only some of their odd traits are exaggerated for humor, making them seem unreal at the same time.If you don't think your way through a movie, you'll never be able to understand it and appreciate it to its fullest capacity."	5.0	Why People Don't Like Napoleon Dynamite	2005-04-25	8	4	4

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2HJB9J5O5CLPB	R. A Rubin	This one started with a semi-retarded teen and I groaned because there has been a spate of retarded comedy characters of late.  I'm thinking of What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Punch Drunk Love.  In the last twenty years, you can throw in fifty or sixty teen outcast comedies with interchangeable casts. The pariah could be an ugly duckling teen girl as in She's All That or a whole cast of teen misfits of both sex's as in Things I like About You.  Napoleon Dynamite takes these concepts to their logical conclusion thereby closing out any possibility that future teen saga's could be original.Are there mentally challenged adolescents in modern civilization like Napoleon or his dim internet-dating brother?  I always asked that question about the Three Stooges.  I need to get over my desire for sophisticated, reality based comedy, and I must accept the quirky world of Indie farce.  Once over this hurdle, I settle down into the underdog theatre of teen losers and enjoy their ultimate triumph. I recommend Napoleon Dynamite and give it four stars.	4.0	Ultimate Triumph of Retarded Teens	2005-01-31	3	3	0

It is a teen film that manages to be utterly hilarious without all of the clich&eacute;s of teen movies nowadays, and this is wonderfully refreshing to see in cinema.  The jokes aren't stale and the dialogue is witty, and it's a good-natured film at heart.  The viewer feels for too cool Napoleon while at the same time laughing at his hilarious antics.  The supporting cast of the film is amazing, too.  It's PG.  It's witty.  It's refreshing.

Predictable cliches, like Napoleon's brother being astounded that his grandma gets annoyed at paying for his hours of internet chat time. Napoleon's constant rudeness was really annoying and off-putting, and I didn't see what was funny about him saying ""sweet"" or ""gosh"" or ""idiots!"" all the time.The only two funny parts for me were: when the farmer shoots the cow in front of the kid-filled school bus, and Uncle Rico's reaction when Napoleon pelts his van with a grapefruit.I'm 36 so I think maybe I'm just too old to get this.

Since then, I have watched it a few more times on cable, and I have found it has more than grown on me.  Now it is one of those pictures that I have to sit and watch anytime I flipped by and see it on tv.  A loveably goofy cast of misfits highlight this film about the biggest misfit of them all.  Layered with silly subplots, the main story involves Napoleon trying to get his friend Pedro(the only kid in high school with a mustache) elected class president.  This film is certainly worth a watch.  Give it a chance, otherwise you might miss something special.	4.0	More than once	2006-03-24	3	3	0

It's got an off-beat sense of humour, while still capturing the essence of high school life's difficulties for the outsider geeks attending the school ND, the character, is just such a geek, and he lives in his small-town home, in a non-traditional family. During the course of the movie, he develops new friendships and a possible romantic interest, and grows enough to put himself out there, literally, for the sake of his new friend, when his friend is on the rocks. It's hard to beat loyalty like that. The off-beat humour comes from both ND's own personality quirks and sayings, and the events of the developing story.

It's definelty a bit of a cult film; only certain people love it. Some rules to enjoying this film are: You have to know that there are only two main stories in this film, but not many others. This movie is about jokes, the people, and the fact that there's a bit of Napolean in all of this, and that this is reality spat in our faces. We only care about what we look like, but that fact is, you can only be who you really are. Great film.	5.0	You either hate it or love it...	2005-07-30	1	0	1

If only he had a script and a director to work with he could have been funny for the remaining time of the movie. The first half is cute because of all the quirky supporting characters (brother Kip, Uncle Rico...)but the second half is stupid because there's hardly any plot developement and literally no ending! It's just people moving around, doing dumb things, and Napoleon saying, ""Freakin' Idiot!"" for the last 30 minutes."	2.0	Cute but  goes nowhere!	2005-06-18	5	2	3
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1AIJEO0G1SWKB	Ricky Lee	"I had been putting off seeing NAPOLEON DYNAMITE until very recently, having heard negative reviews such as Roger Ebert's about this movie.  However, I saw the cover of the DVD and thought that it might be one of those ""quirky"" movies that sometimes surprise you.  I was right--but NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is that and so much more.Some reviewers have suggested that the viewer's enjoyment of the movie is derived from looking down on the protaganist and his relatives and friends.  Yes, Napoleon is something of an oddball, gawky and socially awkward.  However, HE doesn't see anything wrong with himself--in some ways, he's actually quite self-assured, as when, early in the movie, he proclaims that he can ""do whatever (he) wants to do--GOSH!""  And while the eccentricities of Napoleon and his circle may be exaggerated, the film, I think, does make the awkwardness of adolescence that is exacerbated by the social mores of high school in a small town beliveable and relatable--I mean, most of us in high school weren't the ""cool"" kids--maybe not ""geeks"", either, just the vast majority in between.  Napoleon's strength is that he has accepted himself for who he is, although he is sometimes self-deluded (who amongst us wasn't, during high school?).  Thus, I enjoyed the movie because I DIDN'T have to look down on Napoleon and his family and friends--they were just different characters, different kinds of people.Some reviewers also have suggested that there is no plot to the movie.  I disagree, and suggest that there are several plots running through various parts of the the movie:  (1) How will Napoleon and Pedro find dates for the big dance?  (2) Will Napoleon's brother Kip find his ""soul mate"" on the internet?  (3) Will Uncle Rico get his comeuppance?  (4) Can Pedro really win the election for class president?  (5) Will Napoleon and Deb express their feelings to each other?  And the big plot:  Will everybody find a Happy Ending?In response to those who feel that the movie is meaningless, I believe that Napoleon sums up the movie's message in one line:  ""Just listen to your heart. . .that's what I do.""  And he does--he lives his life his own way, and he follows his feelings to help his friend Pedro when he really needs support.  He even listens to his heart to catch ""a delicious bass"" for Deb, to express his feelings (in a weird way, I'll admit, but a way that's true to himself) to her.  The thing is, Napoleon may be awkward, socially inept, and sometimes clueless, but he isn't a phony.  Sure, his thoughts are filled with fantasy, but he doesn't betray his true character to ""fit in"" with everybody else.Speaking of true character, take for instance the big school dance.  Napoleon had the courage to ask the ""cool"" girl, Brittany, to the dance, even giving her a portrait that he drew for her.  When it looked like he might miss the dance, he began running the who knows how many miles to her house to meet her.  Yet, she ditches him as soon as she can.  Sure, she didn't want to be there with him, but he sure made the effort to be there with her.  And while the movie didn't make the common mistake of making the ""cool kids"" irredeemable jerks like in other ""coming of age"" movies, the remark by Summer during her campaign speech against the Hispanic Pedro about not wanting to have  ""chimichangas in the cafeteria"" leaves no doubt as to who the good guys are in this movie.  Also, to conjecture on why the reticent Pedro would suddenly decide to run for class president, I imagine that he may have been a big shot at his previous school in Mexico, but now he's in an alien environment, speaking his second language, just trying to fit in, when he sees the opportunity to reclaim his self-esteem.  The movie doesn't elaborate this point, so I'm just guessing.Geez, I didn't mean to get too deep with this movie, which is really a very funny comedy.  While most of the humor comes from the ""ah-hah, I can relate to that"" mode, I found the bicycle jump, the chicken farm, and the time machine sequences to be side-splittingly funny.  A lot of the humor is also generated by the eccentricities of the characters themselves.  Kip is obsessed with internet dating.  Uncle Rico is trapped in the year 1982 by his supposed glories on the gridiron.  Pedro cuts off all of his hair.  And Napoleon is Napoleon.  But the filmakers don't go for the easy, obvious laughs.  For example, my wife and I were sure that Kip's ""soul mate"", Lafawnduh, HAD to be a transvestite--we were conditioned by Hollywood movies to expect this ""surprise"".  Yet, the surprise turns out that this little independent movie has the balls not to follow convention and take the easy way out to cheap laughter.  There is no profanity, no sex, no graphic violence--Gosh, not even any flatulence jokes!!!--the humor in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is truly well-earned and natural, and much the better for it.Sorry to have gone on so long about this movie, but I really enjoyed it immensely and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.  It's not quite in the class of such classic comedies as THE PRODUCERS, DR. STRANGELOVE, or SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, so I'll strictly grade it at four stars (I would actually give it four-and-a-half stars, if I could).  But to find such pleasure in a film that was shot for $20,000, produced for an additional $20,000, then wowed the audience at Sundance, grossed over $40 million at the box office, and is doing gangbusters on its video release, makes NAPOLEON DYNAMITE a treasure by any measure."	4.0	NAPOLEON DYNAMITE--Heartwarming Humor and Humanity	2005-04-19	6	4	2

Just stupid stuff. Stupid humor usually keeps me quite entertained, as in Dude Where's My Car? and the Scary Movie series. There was funny in that stupid.

It's quirky, choppy, and it almost seems ""homemade"", but it's a wonderful movie and I would say almost ANY age could watch this movie safely.

Yes, Napoleon is a goofy kid who gets picked on alot...are we supposed to like him and identify with him because of that?? Or are we just supposed to laugh at him for being so nerdy? This movie never develops the main characters, we never see them happy! How can we root for a character if we have no idea what they want, where they're going, or what makes them happy???The jokes in this movie might work in a short film or a 3 minute comedy sketch, but drawn out over 90 minutes they just fail to work.Rather than laugh AT the characters in this film, we should feel like we're rooting for them. Take a television series like ""Freaks & Geeks"" - it took geeky looking kids, revealed their hopes and dreams, and you end up identifying with them.In the end, this basically serves as a comedic film for meatheads to laugh at people different from them...and its ok, because the geeks in this film have no emotion and they're not like us!

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"Here's a review from a 41 year old man.  I've read lots of reviews of this movie that absolutely trash it. And obviously, it's become quite a ""cult"" hit amongst a younger crowd.  In fact, it was my 17 year old son who insisted my wife and I see it.  And we immediately loved it, from the delightful opening credits to Napolean's first line ""Whatever I want to!  Gosh!!""The critics who have trashed it frequently say that it makes fun of its characters...that it condescends to them. I'm surprised at that attitude.  In so many movies, oh, let's cite ""Revenge of the Nerds"" as an architypical example, the ""nerds"" are losers who aren't really.  They're just different from the jocks or the ""beautiful people,"" but by the end, they've changed, become winners and made fools of the bad guys. Everyone learns a lesson.The fact is, these movies are untruthful, however ""uplifting"" they may be.  We all know that in life, there ARE ""losers.""  People with not a whole lot to offer the world in general.  Napolean and his family and friends ARE losers. And Napolean KNOWS it. He doesn't seem to dream of being accepted. His ambitions (to draw, to be a martial artist / bow staff wielder, etc.) are things he is deluded about, but he seems to know it.The movie isn't about how Napolean rises from the lower depths to become some sort of hero. Essentially, we see him pull himself up by his own moonboot-straps, primarily to take a few steps into to a world where he connects with people.  He's not about taking on society or arguing that he's ""different but just as worthy"", as the NERDS movies would.When his brother Kip takes him to a Tae Kwon Do class, Napolean is inspired by the ridiculous owner's words, ""Everyone needs a buddy, no more flying solo.""  He goes out and makes friends with the friendless Pedro, and says to him, ""We're pretty much buddies now, right?  So you've got my back and stuff, right?""  Napolean just wants someone to have his back and vice-versa.Later in the movie, Napolean shows his character when he gets Pedro's back by providing entertainment during the school elections.  I won't say more, except to say that Napolean's bravery and reluctance are palpable in the hilarious and touching scene.And what about his ""enemies?""  There is one jock who beats up on Napolean for no good reason, and this guy never really gets a comeuppance.  This guy doesn't get any support from others at school,either, and we certainly know that this ""jock"" is a loser too.Part of this comes from the fact that the movie is set in a small town in an ""obscure"" state (Idaho), that appears to offer few prospects to anyone.  No one dreams of going to Hollywood or becoming a star or a computer whiz, doctor, etc. etc.  There aren't any dreams. (Although, to Napolean and Pedro's credit, they seem to have quite a knack at agriculture...which may be what lays in their future; Deb is a natural entrepreneur.)Napolean, basically, is a loser comfortable in his own skin, and beneath his sullenness, is...a sullen teenager.  He's a pain in the neck sometimes, but through his modest strength of character, he makes a close friend, and takes tentative (and VERY sweetly convincing) steps towards a first romance.  But only tentative...the final shot of him playing tether ball with his female friend tells us all we need to know about how ready he may or may not be for love.Also, this is a rare movie that shows people who don't have a lot of money.  The lack of money is dealt with constantly (they can't afford martial arts lessons, an extra car, a new suit, etc.) This is very refreshing, because in most movies dealing with teens, most of the kids (winners and losers alike) aren't exactly hurting for money.The movie is packed with indelible characters (each more self-deluded than the next) and gentle affirmations of how there is someone for everyone...even Napolean's more hapless brother Kip. It's also very funny (Napolean teaching himself to dance, the farmer shooting his cow, the llama, Uncle Rico's almost pathological desire to travel back in time, etc.)I don't know why this movie connects to today's teens. I'm not a teen, afterall.  But I sure see teens I know in Napolean.  His bursts of ""Idiot!"" ring quite true.  But I appreciate the quiet, unexpected heart of the movie, and I believe the filmmakers aren't poking fun at these characters...they are just staying true to who they are.  I also appreciate that the film is PG rated and doesn't need to show teens all obsessed with sex, drugs, inappropriate music, etc.  They probably are, but the filmmakers aren't interested in examining the usual...they're shedding a little light in humerous corners we don't usually look.This is a funny and touching film. Should appeal to any teen or parent of a teen anywhere."	5.0	AN UNEXPECTED DELIGHT!!	2004-12-31	16	13	3

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"This is a movie I can say is certainly among,if not THE,most quirkiest movie I have ever seen/reviewed.Released in January/04,it stars Jon Heder as the nerd supreme.His world is populated by stereotypical characters of the extreme;the downtrodden and we-don't-fit-in types to the ""popular"" people and bullies.The plot,which if turned sideways would disappear,is as quirky as the characters that populate it.The story takes place in rural Preston,Idaho in the early 90s,but the Dynamite family,house and decor suggest a definite 70s kiche.Napolean and brother Kip(Aaron Ruell)live with their grandmother(Sandy Martin),ho is most definitely butch in nature.One day their granny tells the boys she is going out on a date but ends up in the hospital for a spell after injuring herself while riding an ATV over a particularly large desert dune.Coming to the baby sitting rescue is their uncle Rico(John Gries)who has the old should've,could've-longing from his high school days.As Napoleon plods along at school Kip,who sits in front of a computer screen all day,is persuaded to forgo his internet chatting/surfing long enough to help his uncle make a little bread.Meanwhile at school Napolean has befriended a Mexican student by the name of Pedro(Efren Ramirez).The first big challenge to them comes picking and getting someone to take to the prom.The next one is Pedro`s desire to become student president.Pedro ends up taking a girl that Napolean kind of had his eye on to the dance and in the end Pedro actually wins the presidency.As the movie comes to a close Grandma has returned,Kip has met someone from his chat room who is his ``soul mate`` and that girl Napolean likes,Deb(Tina Majorino),meets up with Nappy to play tether ball.In a post credit sequence Kip and his ``soul mate`` Lafawnduh(Shondrella Avery)get married and a lateto the wedding Napolean rides up on a ``just tamed`` wild horse,which he presents to the bride and groom who ride off as Napolean is heard to utter,``lucky``.As I said there is just enough of a ``plot`` to give the characters here impetus to go from one situation to another and that is it.But since everyone is soooo quirky you pay not so much attention to where it is going as to enjoying the ride itself.Napolean is the star character and he seems to be an 11 year old wrapped up in a teenager`s body.His eyes rarely make contact with anyone,he says ``flippin` `` alot and when frustrated he makes a deep guttural sigh.His run is like the loping gait of the creatures from the original``Invaders from Mars``,just hilarious;another quirky character trait among many,that endears this character(and movie)to the viewer.This movie made for a paltry $400,000 made over $46,000,000!! Astounding.This film is presented in BOTH widescreen(1:85:1) and fullscreen versions,which means they have put it on a dreaded two sided disc.There are special features like a making of featurette,an extended video of the wedding,a short film ``Pelica``,deleted scenes,commentary and stills gallery.The transfer is well done and is clear and crisp.All in all a winner of a film.A more weird and quirky film you will be hard pressed to find but it works wonderfully on many levels.Don`t anaylze it too much,just hang on and enjoy the flippin`ride.Recommended."	4.0	Wierd or what?...but it works!	2011-06-19	0	0	0

Murena Jr. ""tedmurena"""	"Possibly the best High-School Loser movie ever made, Napoleon Dynamite is a film that you will either love or hate but if you are willing to see through some of the silliness of the plot you will see that this is a movie about connecting with your reality whatever that may be. All of the main characters of this film are highly out of touch with mainstream society and even out of touch with themselves.  In a word they are all loners.  As a wise person once told me ""friends keep you sane"" and these people, without friends, are insane.  Living in the past, online, in another culture or just in some other dimension, they all are living lives that aren't checked by the world that goes on around them. This makes conversation, even between each other, disjointed.  Lost, somehow they come together and eventually Napoleon gets a few friends and begins to connect to some sense of reality. Napoleon's moment of revelation comes when he says ""I dont have any skills. Girls only want to go out with guys who have skills... Ninja Skills, Numchuck skills"" ... etc. Here his friend Pedro finally connects with him saying he has drawing skills (which he barely has) and Napoleon begins to have some sense of direction. The setting of the movie is somewhat absurd.  It is set in rural/suburban Idaho with all of its dreary depressingly out of date architecture, which lends itself well to the out of touch feeling the film seeks to develop.Is the movie believable? No.  Is the Movie thoroughly enjoyable? Yes.So why is this possibly the best high-school movie?  The answer is simple:  everyone feels out of touch to a certain degree in high school.  This movie portrays that vividly and humorously.  It isn't the run-of-the-mill cool people - vs. loser film but a film about individuals against the world.  Seeing the film as something other than a lame joke is key to its enjoyment but is certainly a good film for mixed audiences and anyone who has ever felt out of place... maybe even you.Ted Murena"	4.0	A Movie for Anyone who's ever Felt out of Place.

It is very funny but it an understated way with lots of visual humor.  His obnoxious cousin who wishes it was 1982 is so real..it's almost sad.  I can see where this film has a cult following.  It's the underdog against the preppie queen.  It's the underachiever coming out on top.  It's a good little story told in a new creative and imaginative way.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.	5.0	A new form of comedy.  Understated yet cool.	2005-02-09	8	5	3

For me it became an instant comedy classic along with Tommy Boy and Dumb & Dumber.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A422TIGQH6GJ5	Rob	Napoleon Dynamite is both hilarious and awkward, as too often through the film I found myself identifying the the protagonist, who painfully reminds me a little bit too much of me during my teen years, a geeky outsider in school, doing his own thing, associating with characters just as wacky as himself.  It's a very funny film with a number of touching scenes nestled in, filmed as if in some sort of strange 80's vortex.  There are a couple scenes that might be a little inappropriate for young kids, but otherwise this is a great window into the life of a bizarre yet hilarious character.	4.0	Very goofy, very quotable film	2014-02-09	0	0	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A21TJRG577NI21	Robin Cole-Jett	"I don't understand why other reviewers give this film few stars. Does a movie have to be spelled out for everyone? Does the plot have to hit people on the head like a 'delicious bass' before they can understand the story?This is a layered, nonjudgmental and sweet story that isn't suitable for those who don't understand the nuances of life. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is an aknowledgement of friendship and the sacrifices one makes for it, of acceptance, as well as a statement that appearances aren't everything.In the DVD features, the director/ writer explains and shows his senior film project, which was a shorter version of this movie. He says in the voice-over that Napoleon is supposed to embody true friendship (in the film-school film, Napoleon gives up buying a fanny pack, which he really wants, to buy a wig for a Pedro-like character).I've noticed from my own acquaintances that the people who don't like this movie tend to like movies that are more transparent.

Jon Heder is wonderful as Napoleon, a Preston, Idaho, high schooler coping with the mundane day to day problems of family, friends, and school.  But mostly it's the terminal boredom and growing anger of Napoleon's woefully unfulfilling circumstances that drive the quirky and weirdly charming story.  Listening to the straightforward commentary by Heder and screenwriter-director Jared Hess, it becomes clear that there's apparently little intended irony in the fact based events that make up this slightly twisted tale of not coming of age.  I hope there's a sequel. Maybe ""Napoleon Goes To College""?"	5.0	QUIRKY GOOFBALL FILM WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH	2004-12-20	2	1	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2DGIMEDQCMA2H	"RockChic4Life ""BubbleGumGurl"""	Everybody at my school was absolutely in love with Napoleon Dynamite so I figured I'd watch it, first I watched it with my friend who loved the movie and I simply stared at it but laughed along with my friend (total act but she's my bff so I told her I liked it...then I was honest about it and told her I hated it and she said that she hated it to and only watched it because I said that I liked it) but fell asleep (wonder why?) so I didn't get to see it all, then I watched it with my friend who had never seen the movie before and I saw the whole thing and I must say that it is one of the most boring and plotless/pointless movies I have ever seen. I really don't understand how everybody finds it so funny and enjoyable. I liked a few parts/lines but that's about it. I think parts suck and I think some parts...were okay (just barely) but over all it was definitely a so so movie. But the guy who plays Napoleon (Jon Heder) is very cute without all his Napoleon gear on which is a plus but overall, if you want to see this movie, I say rent--actually no, don't even waste the three bucks rental fee...just wait til it comes out on TV...but don't say I didn't warn you...ND sucks...I'm still shocked at how it won Best Movie of the Year, Best Dance Number, and Breakout Male Performance...shocking really.	2.0	GOSH!

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"Napoleon Dynamite is a king among nerds, a slack-jawed, mouth-breathing high school student who suffers the slings and arrows of perpetual ridicule, yet who gives as good as he gets when the treatment gets too rough.  Luckily, Napoleon is far from alone in his nerddom. He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms.  Napoleon's Uncle Rick is what might be called a ""muscular nerd,"" a used-up, middle aged football player who dreams of his glory days in 1982 when he was just one play away from a career in the NFL and a life of fame and fortune, and who now spends his time hawking Tupperware products, selling miracle breast enhancement devices, and investing in time travel machines he finds in catalogues.  Napoleon also befriends the school's newest nerd, a transfer student named Pedro, and tries to start up a romance with the shy and awkward Deb, who sheepishly goes door to door drumming up business for her studio that specializes in ""glamour"" photo shots for a decidedly unglamorous clientele.Set in a small town in rural Idaho, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a quirky regional comedy that achieved phenomenal mainstream success at the American box office.  Its appeal is in its low-keyed, understated look at a group of people that more of us probably identify with than we would like to acknowledge.  This is a movie for anyone who has ever felt unattractive or unpopular, who just never quite ""fit in"" with the people who really counted, especially in those dark ages known as the ""teen years.""  One can't help liking and rooting for these bizarre and eccentric individuals who are really just looking for the same love and acceptance that we all are.Director Jared Hess, along with co-writer Jerusha Hess, never feels the need to exaggerate or overstate the comedy.  It would have been easy for them to have turned this into another ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations.  Instead, they let the story develop subtly and gradually, making the film feel more attuned to real life in the process.  It may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the writers achieve their humor through a kind of understated hyperbole that allows us to laugh with the characters rather than at them.  These nerds may be nerds to the core, but they reflect the longings and doubts common to all of us at one time or another.  As a result, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is warm and humanistic where it could easily have been cruel and condescending.The filmmakers are helped immeasurably by a wonderfully talented cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly.  Joe Heder as Napoleon, Aaron Ruell as his brother, Kip, Efren Ramirez as Pedro, and Tina Majorino as Deb all deliver their lines in a flat, emotionless, singsong monotone that perfectly captures the defense mechanism each of them has set up as a shield against a brutal, uncomprehending world.  Yet, Napoleon and his fellow nerds never settle for victim status, as each finds a way to assert his individuality and carve out a little piece of happiness for himself.  As an actor, only Jon Gries as Napoleon's Uncle Rico gets to break through the somnambulist haze and go for the fences in his delivery.""Napoleon Dynamite"" is clearly not the kind of movie that every audience will appreciate, but those movie watchers with a taste for the offbeat and quirky will have a fun time with it."	4.0	"The real ""Revenge of the Nerds"""	2005-12-31	11	8	3

However, all my friends think it is the one of the best comedies ever made. This is much like Easy Rider. I think it is one of the most pointless movies ever made, but I also did not live through the 60's so the whole point of the movie was lost on me. For those of us who grew up in the 80's/90's, this movie makes more sense. Yes, the humor is VERY dry and it is a slow movie (which I think makes it better).

After ten minutes, she said, ""What is it that you find remotely funny about this?""  Reading the reviews here, I'm equally puzzled why some people hate what I consider to be a masterpiece.A movie gets to create its own universe.  That universe must be internally consistent, and follow its own rules.  Napoleon dynamite does this well, creating an entirely unique universe with no Hollywood cliches, no tear-jerking stereotypical themes.  For some people, that could mean that it lacks the signposts with which they are familiar, the action or the jokes or the themes that make something entertainment.By refusing to adopt those stereotypes, the movie hits the viewer as a refreshing dose of reality.  Movie reality is usually a carefully woven script of lines that fit nicely together.  Napolean Dynamite is not.  It reminded me of all those times I felt out of place or alienated in high school, unable to say anything intelligent.People who like the movie, I believe, have a taste for the unique and for the artistic, as opposed to the merely entertaining.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AGSWTH7SP2256	R. W. Rasband	"For the past few years there has been a movement in American film you could call ""The New Mormon Cinema.""  Young Latter-day Saint filmmakers (definitely inspired by the Sundance Film Festival which is held right in their own backyard) have been making inexpensive independent films that are targeted at the Mormon population that stretches in the west from Alberta in Canada down past the Mexican border (the so-called ""Mormon Corridor."")  Most of these movies have been really bad, cheaply done sit-com influenced ""comedies"" that have had absolutely no influence on non-Mormon audiences.  (With the honorable exeception of Richard Dutcher, the director of good movies like the missionary drama ""God's Army"" and the thriller ""Brigham City."")  Things began to change this year with widespread recognition going to the tough-minded World War II drama ""Saints and Soldiers"" and this twisted little comic  masterpiece, ""Napoleon Dynamite.""Jared and Jerusha Hess are products of Brigham Young University's film school and they made ND with a bunch of their friends.  The unspoken assumption of this film is that most of the kids are Mormons.  Some critics who misunderstood the movie as ""condescending"" have no experience with real people like these.  I live in rural Utah and I can testify that Hess is only mildly exaggerating.  The critics somehow miss the love with which the characters are drawn, just as some Minnesotans weren't too thrilled with the Coen brothers' ""Fargo.""  Napoleon's pathetic older brother Kip has been singled out as particularly unbelievable.  But believe me, Kips are a dime a dozen in Idaho (and Utah, too.)Napoleon himself is not so much acted as incarnated by Jon Heder, who would win some sort of Oscar if people could only see he was playing a role, not living it.  Napoleon is the real nerd deal, not some idealized John-Hughes-style Hollywood version.  You really feel the anguish of his life, even as it provokes guilty belly laughs.  The genius of the movie is how the Hesses take the angst of Todd Solondz (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Happiness"") and put their triumphantly uniquely Mormon spin on it.Hess is the second Mormon director, after Neil LaBute in ""The Shape of Things"", to make reference to singer Elvis Costello (""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of Costello's aliases.)  The movie Napoleon is as physically unprepossessing as Costello is, until he starts to sing.  You see, Mormons are always worrying about what other people think of them, because of their long-time outsider status in American society.  This overwhelming self-consciousness can make them feel as awkward and crushed by the culture as Napoleon is.  But inside they just know they are as dynamic as the very name ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  The opportunity awaits for them to strut their true stuff.  An individual like Napoleon can't be destroyed if he doesn't want to be.  There's something eternal in him that will win out.  The importance of this thought is why the Hesses avoid the very appearance of sentimentality in their presentation of Napoleon.  You have to learn to love him in spite of his monstrous imperfections, because he is human.  And you rejoice in Napoleon's final dance, which is five or six of the most joyous minutes in a movie this year.It's also important that Kip and Napoleon redeem themselves by reaching out to others not like them.  Kip hilariously to La Fawnduh, and Napoleon to Pedro and Deb.  The Hesses are brave enough to make sympathetic jokes about multiculturalism here.  Certainly, Preston Idaho, won't save them; but maybe Detroit and Mexico will.  I left ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with genuinely earned good feelings about humanity in general and the future of Mormon movies in particular."	5.0	The New Mormon Cinema Finds Its Poster Boy	2004-12-07	77	66	11
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	In an era of film making where the studio's main concern is the opening weekend box office report, Napoleon Dynamite kicks that mentality in the family jewels with some sweet kung fu moves.By showing quality movies can come cheap and make a profit hopefully a new trend of big studio gambles on little movies made with more heart than moolah will emerge.  Napoleon Dynamite was made for under a million bucks and grossed over forty million in theaters.  Not to mention its phenomenal success on DVD.Jon Heder plays Napoleon(in the best performance by a new actor in 2004), a delusional geek who's claim to fame are imaginary numchuck skills and drawing mythical monsters.  He's awesome at tetherball(singles) and a whiz at political campaign strategy.  He's fond of tater tots and his lips are chapped.I can't remember the last time a movie had me laughing to the point of tears.  Boy was I cryin', I can admit it.An instant cult classic and 2004's funniest movie, Napoleon Dynamite is a treat for anyone who attended high school or is amused by life's little absurdities.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A31ZVXSLVHLLCN	"S. A. Johnson ""misterscooter"""	"4.0 to 4.5 stars.I have a hard time giving out 5 stars to a movie because that means the movie pretty much achieved perfection, whether to me personally or in the grand scheme of moviedom.  However, I do think that the makers of Napoleon Dynamite had goals in mind with this movie and I think they achieved those goals in making a very entertaining movie.  For a lot of people, acheiving your set goals can mean perfection.  For reaching those goals, I think it means they put out a darn good movie.This is definitely a character driven, as opposed to a plot driven, movie.  The characters and the actors that play them stand out and make the scenes memorable.  None of the characters seem to be like anyone I know, yet I can see a lot myself and others throughout bits and pieces of everyone.  Maybe that makes it hard to specifically identify with them but I did like that even the ""mean kids"" weren't as mean as Hollywood likes to make the bully.  And the ""good kids"" weren't as pure and infallible on the other end.  And because the extremes aren't so far apart, it doesn't put characters far out of reach for us, in spite of their quirkiness.The script is simple but well written and although there really aren't any punchlines, the ""jokes"" are buried in layers and require multiple viewings to catch them all, whether they are spoken or visual.  And the movie provides plenty of lines that are quotable in everyday life without being filled with innuendo or questionable language.Finally, I have a theory about this movie.  Most of the characters are in High School, but are really stuck at the stage of life they were in during 5th grade.  Whether it is what they eat at lunch (tater tots), the things they are into (bikes, not cars), the drawings, the ninja stars, etc., I see myself at age 11.

To me it was just a sweet, funny movie about a nerd who really didn't care that he was nerd. After all, he had skills! I think many people will be able to relate to the nerds vs. the popular kids theme (I mean, didn't your school have a Summer Wheatley?) and Napoleon's sense of not really caring made this a real 'feel-good' movie. So many scenes reminded me of my school years--tetherball on the playground, slow dancing in the gym, tator tots in the cafeteria. Great lines too! I find myself saying ""Yessssss"" far too often now, but what a fun movie find! Make sure you listen to the commentary on the special features. Oh yeah, I let my eight year old son watch this and he loved it too. Definitely a safe movie for families to watch together...if you like that kind of humor!"	4.0	Sweet!	2005-01-03	0	0	0

WOW. wicked cool. Funny, interesting, insightful.My son, the Marine, over in Iraq, he loves this movie, and I must agree. This is something! Don't you just get tired of the run of the mill, cranked out Hollywood spatter, that we are suppose to rave over, even if we know in our hearts that it's not that great?Well, then, this is a breath of fresh air!The kid, Napoleon, played by Jon Heder, is about as ugly a kid as you'll ever meet. Not terribley bright either. But, there is something loveable about him. Maybe it's the ""Me"" in him. He is me, he is you, he represents all of our insecurities, faults, dreams that go unfulfilled. We all blunder, we all blow it, we all have dreams that get poo pooed by a family member or friend. We pretend that it doesn't bother us. but, I think it does.Napoleon embodies all our fears and hopes. that is what makes him so special. His idiot-ness is out, in plane sight,  for all to see. we laugh, but we FEEL him, and FEEL his pain. His family, brother, and uncle, are an extension of his painful dumb-assedness. they are a hoot! but, in a way that is embarrassing. like an uncle that is so absurd, you hope your friends don't come over when he's there, because you will be embarrassed by him.Life isn't all pretty, and we don't all look like Paris or Brittany or Tom or Leonardo.. life is cruel. life is hard. And most all of us can relate to Napoleon. Great acting, great humor. Great humor with a straight face. And great dancing at the end. Which reminds me, I enjoyed his friend, the Mexican kid, can't remember his name. Good on him too!My dear man, Norman, laughed his bum off (can i say ass?) He liked it too.It's a slice of real life, that's what makes it great.thank you, son, be safe."	5.0	My son's FAV, next to Donnie Darko - a HOOT	2005-12-30	5	4	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A37S3ACL57LN62	"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra"""	"Napoleon Dynamite has been recently released on DVD. The small, independent film has become one with a lot of fans. Buttons declaring, ""I love tater tots"" and ""Vote for Pedro"" are sold in popular stores. T-shirts identical to those worn by cast members are sold at many online websites.Why has the nation fallen in love with Napoleon Dynamite? For one thing, the characters are incredibly memorable. Napoleon is a classic outcast who walks around with his eyes half closed and his mouth half open saying random things like, ""I caught you a delicious bass"" and playing tether ball by himself. His brother Kip, a thirty two year old man with braces, chats online all day with ""babes"" and meets the love of his life, a black woman named Lafawnduh who teaches him how men behave in Detroit where she lives. The Dynamite brothers are forced to be babysat by their uncle Rico when their grandmother is injured in a dirt bike accident. Rico wishes he lived in the 1980s although much of the movie seems to be set then anyway. Napoleon's friend Pedro, a new kid at school, decides to run for class president. Deb, a shy girl, takes glamour shots and sells boondoggle key chains to raise money for college. Each of the outcast characters has their own unique personality traits that make the movie funny and interesting.The pacing of the film is slow at times and after viewing it the first time, you might be thinking, ""What just happened?"" Think about the jokes, think about the characters, and you'll be laughing for sure.Many of the scenes in the film are random. When the film starts, viewers see Napoleon embarking on a children's school bus and tossing an action figure attached to a string out the window. The scene ends and is never made reference to again.That last scene at the end of the credits is a welcome addition to the film.The deleted scenes are pretty good too. The best one is where they kids are playing kickball in gym class.Much of the movie seems to take place in the 1980s although it is not. Deb wears her hair in a side ponytail in several scenes. The school dance features Cindi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and puffy sleeved dresses. However, more modern things tell that the town is only partially in a timewarp. The Backstreet Boys' ""Larger Than Life"" is played at the end of the film. The confusion over the time period adds to the subtle humor of the film.Most of the humor is found in Napoleon's own mind. He believes that girls only like guys with skills so he wants to learn how to use nun chucks and hack into computers. He also tells stories about ""ligers,"" his favorite animals which are bred from a lion and a tiger for their magical powers. One of his most common utterances when asked what he is going to do is, ""Whatever I feel like I want to do, gosh!""Some of the film seems clich&eacute; like the popular girls that are mean to Napoleon and Pedro and some of the jokes but these things are downplayed and take a backseat to the scenes between the outcast characters.The full effect of the film can only be experienced when one sees the way the actors deliver their lines and maintain their characters. Overall, it is an excellent comedy and a nice change of pace from the standard formula we are used to."	5.0	Napoleon Dynamite is Sweet!	2005-03-01	12	12	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2RYXI80UAB5OF	Samhain333	"THIS motion picture has a very blatant anti-white / pro-whigga message peddled to teens!A Mexican kid asks a WHITE stuck-up girl to a dance and she snottily declines. A geeky white kid ( who happens to be the title character, if that's of any importance ) asks another girl, also a WHITE girl who likewise turns out to be a stuck-up snotty biatch. She agrees to accompany him to the event but ditches him upon arriving there because she was appalled by his crude drawing of her likeness ( which he erroneously used to woo her ). The two white stuck-up girls, as it turns out, happen to be running together in the high school election as president and mate ( respectively ). The previously spurned Mexican and white nerd decide to team together and run against them. Then at some point later in the proceedings, a certain negress arrives upon the scenario, blowing into town on a transit bus. This newly arrived negress, it turns out, is the lover of the white geeky boy title characters whigga brother. He carries on lewdly and ostentatiously with his negress girlfriend and tells the white geeky boy ""THIS is my soul mate! Yours is out there too somewhere. You just have to wait for her "" , .. . Hmmmmmmmm, . . I wonder WHAT THAT might possibly be a not-so subtle endorsement of , especially taking the two White snotty stuck-up girls, from earlier in the film, into account? The negress gives geeky white boy an audio casset of some hip hop disco funk'abooty type ""music"" and he then practices ""dancing"" to it. Finally, at the high school election ceremony, white nerd Wows the audience and wins majority vote by playing the disco hip hop funk'abooty ""music"" that the negress had imparted to him and doing a ridiculous ""dance"" to it which apparently and inexplicably impresses them greatly ( exclaiming ""YAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" and obnoxiously chanting loudly, repeatedly and in collective unison ""GO WHITE BOY!!!!!! GO WHITE BOY!!!!!!!!!! GO WHITE BOY!!!!!!!! ... .. ."" ), .. . and thus, in the process, CREAMING the duo of stuck up snotty WHITE bitchez who'd scorned them earlier in the film!!Surely one of the most blatant and flagrant examples of white-self hatred and whiggaism promoted in popular teen-oriented media ""culture"" by contemporary Joolywood that I have yet beheld!!!!!!!"	1.0	A Flagrant Endorsment of Whiggaism!!!!!	2013-05-07	15	1	14

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB	"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First"""	"Last summer's runaway indie comedy smash ($400,000 budget, $40 million gross to date), Napoleon Dynamite, won't make everyone laugh. OK, maybe most people won't laugh, but this is a film with a fiercely loyal cult following (count how many Vote For Pedro shirts you see on your campus) that will appeal to former teen outcasts, nerds and Aspies (OK, so maybe the Aspie bit is redundant). Napoleon is a geeky high schooler/prodigal Aspie who wears snow boots in summer, draws Pegasus and unicorns in his Trapper Keeper, and lives with his very butch grandmother, a finicky llama named Tina, and Kip, his nerdy older brother who ""chats online with babes all day"" and is training to be a cage fighter (yeah, right).Napoleon's school life consists of getting beat up by the resident jocks, and his home life isn't much better. (""How was school?"" his grandmother asks Napoleon. ""The worst day of my life, what do you think?"").  He soon meets Deb, a geeky, painfully shy neighbor who is earning money for college by producing glamour shots in her basement and selling those funky boondoggle keychains (I am SO a child of the `80s!), and Pedro, a Mexican fresh across the border, who answers everything in a syllable or less, wears holy medals, and has santo candles ringing his bathtub.The movie is filled with out-there moments: after Napoleon's grandma breaks her tailbone on the sand dunes (don't even ask!), his obnoxious Uncle Rico (which means ""rich"" in Spanish, appropriate because Rico is full of failed get-rich-quick schemes) comes to stay. Rico and Napoleon engage in heated battle, including flinging steaks and grapefruit at each other from moving vehicles, testing a time machine they bought online (which produces groinal electrocution), and Kip finally meets his Internet chat room honey LaFawnduh in the ample flesh (I thought, after a prolonged setup, that....well, never mind, put the pieces together for yourself. Hint: it involves Kip's comment about never seeing a full bodyshot of LaFawnduh before they meet).Napoleon now has a gang of loyal geek outcasts, and the trio try to make their way through another horrible school year, including the prom and class elections. This leads to the film's funniest scene involving Napoleon, an awesome Jamiroquai song (Canned Heat), and D-Kwon's Dance Grooves. Actually, I found this film to be hysterical, being a) a child of the `80s and b) an incorrigible social outcast in high school. Warning: if you are one of the people who enjoys this kind of humor, be careful not to inhale your popcorn and choke during the many funny scenes that creep up unawares."	4.0	Geez, what a FLIPPIN' IDIOT!

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3H94KWKY4C0NS	Sarah	When it first came out in the theaters, I saw a few commercials, but honestly, I thought it was just a joke movie. I was skeptical about the whole plot and humor it was talking about. The first time I watched it, I only saw about one half of it, the second time I only saw about one half of it again, but the third time I watched it all the way through. The part where he dances in front of the whole auditorium is priceless. My friends and I laugh hysterically everytime. Everyday, we recite lines from it on a regular basis. I even suggested the theme of our winter semi-formal to be Napoleon Dynamite, but nobody took me seriously, so now we're having one of our spirit days be ND and 80's Day. Anyways, the movie had a lot of funny parts in it and NOT just the part where they're riding on a bike and when the kid slams him into a locker. If you watch the deleted scenes, the kickball scene is the BEST. It's so hilarious, you won't be able to NOT laugh. It has a plot, even if it is very faint, and the music is funny in its own way. Next time I'm at the store, there's no doubt that I'm going to be buying Napoleon Dynamite.

The next weekend I watched the movie with a friend we both sat quietly watching the plotless film. It looked as if it had potential in the beginning, so we waited and waited for the plot to develop, only to discover there wasn't one. There is a reason the character Napoleon Dynamite doesn't get recognized in every day life because they are compulsive liars to make their boring lives seem worthwhile.

Even though I have long since been excommunicated, that is what made the movie make perfect sence to me. Remember the, singing sign language scene? If you were raised Mormon you too know one song in sign language, we all learned it, performed it.....come on sing along .....as I have loved you....loved one .......but I digress.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	"If you are looking for overt, laugh aloud humor, then you will be disappointed in Napoleon Dynamite.  Any real verbal or visual humor is very deadpan and subtle, and hard to miss if you are seeking out a belly laugh.The funniest part of the entire movie is the characters themselves, who go beyond nerd into the land of dweebs so inept that they are the ones that pass beyond the notice of society.  They are not handsome or beautiful, they are not smart, they have no talents, they are not social, and they are not even gifted with humor or likeable personalities.  They quite literally have absolutely nothing going for them except an exchange of oxygen and an ability to ambulate.There is Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) who is a skinny, slack open-mouth-breather with frizzy orange hair and pants worn so high they look like they are eating him.  He is sullen and caustic, making up ridiculous stories that make him seem more important.  He lives with his fast-living Grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his 32-year-old unemployed brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip is skinny, poorly dressed, distinctly stupid, and spends his entire day in chat rooms on his PC.Grandma gets injured while jumping her Quad over a sand dune, and sends Uncle Rico to watch the ""boys"".  Uncle Rico (played by Jon Gries) is an even older loser who lives in a hideous orange van, and constantly wishes he could time travel back to 1982 to change the outcome of a football game that he believes would have made him famous.  He makes his living doing door-to-door sales of everything from Tupperware to bust-enhancers.Don't forget to watch this movie all the way to the end of the credits.  After the final credits, there is another entire scene to watch that you won't want to miss.Napoleon Dynamite is well acted and well filmed, but is more a study in human ineptness rather than an outright comedy.  I would have liked to have seen more of Grandma in the movie, I believe she could have brought a little action and a few more laughs to the film.  Over all, not bad, but not good either.  My preference would have been to give it only 3.5 stars, but gave `Napoleon' the benefit of the doubt.  Recommendation: rent, don't buy."	4.0	Dry humor and well done, but not great	2004-12-28	3	0	3

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"There's something about high school that provides endless fodder for great movies.  ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Sixteen Candles,"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" captured the '80s angst of my high school years.  ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" may be about the generation after mine, but both movies had so much truth and wisdom that they spoke to a geezer like me as well as their target audience.  I know I'll watch all of these movies in 20 years and they will still ring true to me then.""Napoleon Dynamite"" tries to be in the same mold as these essential films.  It tries to skewer the dark underbelly of high school, with its baseless favoritism, its soulless disregard for the unpopular, and its mind-numbing tedium.  To a certain extent, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" succeeds - there are a few laugh-out-loud moments about the truth of high school life.But ""Napoleon Dynamite"" falls a bit through its titular hero.  Napoleon may be the biggest geek ever to have his own film.  To a certain extent, Napoleon is universal.  Like every high school student, his inner talents are bound by insecurity and immaturity.  So Napoleon responds with lies (the fictitious girlfriend from Oklahoma, the mastery of martial arts) and insults to protect himself.  Who didn't do something like that when they were 15?And while Napoleon has an undeniable sweetness to him, the movie keeps the audience at arm's length.  This is a movie populated by morons, dweebs, and dorks.  They speak in sudden bursts of banality.  While the cast generally has the pent-up insecurity down, the movie screams for someone like Max Fischer from ""Rushmore"" to speak with poetry and spirit about who he is and where he wants to go.Instead, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" offers no hope for its characters (some of whom it seems to love).  The high school students are varying degrees of cloistered non-entities, and the adults generally seem to be the same.  When Napoleon's older brother gets married to a towering African American, LaFonda, she is played strictly for laughs and he remains the same befuddled twit, only now in gangsta garb.  Sure, it's funny, and LaFonda's devotion to him is as sweet as it is inexplicable.  But it doesn't seem to go anywhere other than to the surreal.  No character offers Napoleon any hope that his future in the wilds of Idaho offers anything other than endless years of frustration and yearning -- playing tetherball, even with your soulmate, gets old after a while.Indeed, when the DJ plays Alphaville's cheesy ""classic"" ""Forever Young"" at a dance, the lyric ""I want to be forever young"" doesn't seem like an anthem to these kids.  It feels more like a prison sentence.Yet I'm glad that I've seen ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  Not only did I get some genuine laughs out of the movie, I now understand the point of all those retro ""Vote for Pedro"" T-shirts I've been seeing.A funny movie that's worth a rental, but not a slot in the video library."	3.0	"Cult smash not up to standards of ""Election"" or ""Rushmore"""	2005-10-10	6	3	3

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3ACRPV8IRCW3	Secretariatgal	This movie is probably the worst piece of trash the media could have come out with! Sorry, that's not good enough, I need to rant some more...I think people actually lose brain cells from watching this dumber than dumb movie. Then everyone around my school had to keep quoting it, probably because this movie comes from the kind of inferior minds that speak their language. I am a big goer for a plot. I like thick, hard to detect plots, for it symbolizes greatness in the work. May I dare say this movie failed to have a plot at all!!! This just followed a nerdy teen and his friend through days of school. I did not seem to find any of the dumb humor funny, and it only kept interest to finish the film only to see if the characters find out their life is worthless. Instead, the movie comes to an abrupt end, with absolutely no intelligent dialect at all and no story throughout. This is just a badly-put together fictional documentary of a nerd, if you take a step back to look at it. I could not believe that people in the movie business would go so low as to forget to put a plot in this story!I'm leaving it at this:There is simply no excuse for this trash. This movie all but sucked to high heaven.	1.0	No Plot!	2005-10-06	26	9	17

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV	S.E. Poza	"My husband, who grew up in an affluent subarb in California, and I, who grew up in a tiny little coal town in Pennsylvania, viewed this movie very differently. For me, there was a great deal of resonance to the sort of kids I grew up with (and perhaps to some extent the certain type of kid I was) in high school in the 70s. To him, the characters seemed too dumb and unlikeable.I could only guess that those who grow up in urban or suburban settings see less of the sort of inarticulate, unsophisticated kid that Napoleon is and find the character lacking credibility and cannot empathize with him to any extent. Of course, this is a character in a movie that can be categorized as a ""quirky comedy"" so he's about 30% more dorky and inarticulate than the worst of what I grew up with but he's close enough to the real thing not to be a parody or caricature.The movie doesn't really have much of a plot but seems more to track a segment of Napoleon's life. Napoleon is awkward, unattractive, and expresses himself in socially inapproriate ways. He's like a 10 year-old stuck in a 16-year old's body. He copes with his lack of ability to relate to others by attempting to form friendships based on very little communication and by drawing fantasy characters of his own invention. The viewer gets the feeling Napoleon isn't quite self-aware enough to be too bothered by anything but is old enough to have certain impulses (like the desire for a girlfriend) that he acts on.The interesting thing about this movie is that, despite his awkwardness, you don't feel sorry for Napoleon because he doesn't feel sorry for himself. He also doesn't seem to get very angry at the injustice of being placed low in the social pecking order or being randomly hit and harrassed by his schoolmates. For the most part, he simply does his thing. It's not that he's oblivious to what is happening, he's just coping in the only way he can and most of those efforts are what are funny about the movie.This isn't a movie with obvious or broad humor. It's the antithesis of humor based on wit or clever dialog while not being stupid humor. It's humor much in the same way that ""Lost in Translation"" was a romance. It defies categorization and may or may not be everyone's cup of tea."	4.0	Perhaps more resonant for rural dwellers	2005-06-21	7	6	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1FCWRSICTO2AH	S. Harris	"I started out disliking this movie.  I just wasn't laughing much. Napoleon (Jon Heder) is so awkward that it's difficult for his character to gain traction at first.  He's just not very likable - not even in a sad sack sort of way. OK. But it just isn't Napoleon.  His family is an assorted bunch of nuts you've come to expect now in Indie films, and that means there's plenty of dead air and blank stares.  So much so that you're remembering the same ""realistic"" devices used in Indie films like ""Ghost World,"" ""The Station Agent,"" or ""Welcome to the Doll House.""  Don't' get me wrong, I love all those films - but with ""Napoleon"" there is a studied sameness that lacks the freshness of those movies.  Whatever.  So why did I like this?  Well, the movie's kind of sneaky in how it accomplishes this.  Basically, Napoleon starts to come out of his shell due to friendships he begins to forge (despite himself) - with kids that are almost as awkward as himself - in particular, Pedro, his best friend, and Deb, his budding love interest  (played effectively by Efren Ramirez and Tina Majorino).  And one virtue Napoleon has is loyalty to his friends. Further, most high schools are overwhelmingly populated by Napoleons, Pedros, and Debs, and not by the beautiful few, who always seem to run the yearbooks and win the class elections.  The end of the movie sealed things for me.  Napoleon, in an act of friendship, shows he has the stuff, and all is right with the world.  This is probably a three star movie, but there is a genuine sweetness that bumps it up one for me.  On top of that, my kids loved it (Napoleon is hugely popular with young teens - and it's not hard to see why)."	4.0	Sweet	2005-02-18	0	0	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	What a colorful and cockeyed title character this film weaves in Napolean Dynamite, with his overbite large glasses, frizzy red hair, tiffs with practically everyone in his school who bugs him, and a daily dose of temper tantrums.It's a Wes Andersen type character study with very little really of a story until about the halfway mark. Instead, we get slice-of-life moments as we watch Napoleon deal with new friendship, girls (especially shy but provocative Deb (Tina Majorino) who has eyes for our hero), bullies, martial arts and dance. Tossed in for good measure are other hilarious characters of his family.Eventually our lovable geek develops into his own and shines on his own terms with a brilliant climatic show stopper. Highly recommended, especially if you've liked films like Rushmore or Tennenbaums.	4.0	ODDBALL BUT JOVIAL AFTER-SCHOOL SPECIAL	2004-10-09	39	30	9
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A5GCQB7S3XGUI	"Shaun Haines ""No political agenda"""	"Napoleon Dynamite, I think, is one of those movies you either get, or you don't.  Getting or not getting it has more to do, I think, with where you come from and your own life experiences than any measurement on the ""hipness scale.""Some people will laugh because they think the characters are pathetic and stupid and, well...it's fun to laugh at people so we can feel better about ourselves, isn't it?  For people like that, it is probably important to pay attention to Don, the ""cool"" guy at Preston High who laughs increduously at Napoleon and his friends...but who is also unaware that he's the most pathetic character in the film.Anyway, I think the genius of this movie is partly in its deadly accurate portrayal of small-town American life for teenagers.  I grew up in rural Maine (another potato farming state) and I identified very strongly with many of the seemingly absurd situations in the movie...the wacky characters are not so wacky, really.  The way some shots are set up say so much about what a struggle it can be to fit in in a place where the both minds and cliques are pretty closed.Most of the movie's charm is in its examination of the power of true friendship.  Anyone who doesn't think there is a deeper meaning to this somewhat pointless, plotless, random collection of bizarre situations doesn't understand what it means to be willing to do anything for people you care about.In the end, this is a highly original movie(with a very good soundtrack)that will be enjoyed by the Dons of the world who like to laugh at the geeks (unfortunately) and enjoyed more by those who can see pieces of their own humanity in Napoleon and his family and friends."	5.0	Painfully Spot-On Look at Rural High-School Existence	2006-02-26	7	6	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1MHXA59Q9O0GV	"Shazzy ""Shazzy"""	"Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the typical sad-sack, luckless loser that has permeated high schools for seemingly centuries. He has no friends, he's picked on by bullies, he has a somewhat-odd home life ... but through it all, he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.Napoleon and his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) live with their grandmother, but at the beginning of the film she tells them she needs to take off for a couple days. Enter their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), a self-starter who's living in 1982 (when the coach of his high school football team declined to put him in as quarterback, thus altering Rico's life forever). Some of the funniest scenes in the film involve Napoleon's often-combative relationship with Uncle Rico; Rico is also bound and determined to return to those halcyon days of his youth via a time machine he's seen advertised on the Internet, and he enlists Kip to help him raise the funds.Napoleon befriends the new kid in school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who has a sweet bike, can talk to girls, and has an actual mustache. But like Napoleon, Pedro is a misfit. Both sometimes hang out with yet another taciturn student, Deb (Tina Majorino, all grown up from Waterworld), who secretly (it seems) likes Napoleon. But there isn't a lot of focus on their relationship, because Napoleon himself is fairly oblivious to how people perceive him. This isn't a story about young love or lust, it's a story about a misfit refusing to fit - while fitting in with others like him.Jon Heder is perfectly cast as the gawky, dorky Napoleon; he resembles Butt-Head in countenance, although certainly not in temperament or intelligence. Mouth agape and with an awkward gait, Napoleon is about as odd a duck as you'd find in high school, and yet he still manages to survive with his dignity intact. He's a good egg, although he seems to overreact at times: ""What are you gonna do today, Napoleon? Napoleon: Whatever I feel like I wanna do.....GOSH!"" Still, his delivery is perfect. You can readily picture a Napoleon in any high school.I think where the film ultimately succeeds, aside from the casting of Heder, is that it doesn't fall into the traps of predictability and stereotyping. Sure, it's a high school movie, and there are snobby pretty girls and arrogant jocks, but not much time is devoted to them. Sure, there's a big dance, but it doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd expect it to. What you're left with, then, isn't a typical coming-of-age story, but rather a unique take on a rather mundane - albeit life-altering - time in a boy's life."	5.0	Funny and unique!	2006-01-06	7	7	0

But ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has no value whatsoever except to trick some confused people into thinking that it has some value.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AJ9W09EUQPAKE	Sirin	Napoleon Dynamite does nothing new when it comes to plot - nerdy outcasts suffer through locker slammings, unpopularity, loneliness in the face of pretty, popular things only to find that - just you wait! There is a twist. This is probably one of the top five cliched plots in filmwriting school. However, it is worth seeing because of the original characters. Napoleon is the nerds nerd. He dozes through life not so much angst ridden as suffused with ennui. He accepts his lowly status - his lack of 'skills', the regular locker slammings, his rediculous family (such as his older, charisma free brother Chip who chats up 'babes' on the internet) and his lack of friends. His relations with girls are comically stilted 'I like your sleeves'. 'Thanks, I made them myself'. Eventually he finds salvation through his only two friends - monosyllabic Mexican Pedro, who is up against popular and pretty Summer for class president, and the erstwhile Debs, who is the classic beautiful ugly girl, if you catch my drift. The setting is also superbly quirky - dry, stifling rural Idaho complete with red barns and hick farmers who pay a dollar an hour for chicken relocation and reward their workers with raw egg shakes.The ending is predictable, in the 'School of Rock' mode, though do stay on after the credits for the 'real', hidden ending - I won't reveal, but it's the best scene of the movie!	3.0	New wine in old wineskins	2007-04-05	2	1	1

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A19MHOF8RVQOWN	"S. Johnson ""heartsurgery"""	I really like Napoleon Dynamite. I'd have given it 5 stars, but it took me several viewings to understand the movie. On the surface, its just a bonehead comedy about dorks and nerds, and I didn't like it. But there's some real subtle acting that I didn't notice at first because its such a weird movie with quirky characters which are funny, but distract one initially from the theme. Its almost a perfect movie, which will be appreaciated as the years pass by. Some of the scenes which are really subtle are when Napoleon's date leaves him at the dance, and he looks at himself in the mirror.The movie is about high school outcasts, dreamers and wannabees. It brings you into their world without patronizing them. A world of drawing and dreaming about unicorns and babes and wanting to be accepted and liked. Its about how we judge people, or rather misjudging people'a worth, and the meaning of friendship and loyalty. It's about how everyone has personal worth.  Its about wanting to say the right thing, when you don't have the skills to, and having friends accept one for who they are. In the end, I'm always charmed by Napoleon's courage to be happy with who he is, and Deb's acceptance of him as he is. It's such a charming movie. It's ok to be happy with yourself, no matter how strange your interests, and finding out that you like people for who they are inside.

That's the impression you get of Napoleon (Jon Heder) in Napoleon Dynamite...that he's high all the time.Basically the movie follows this kid (Napoleon) through a monotony of high school and family situations. Napoleon responds to these situations as if in a drug induced stupor. In this film his loser character/attitude prevails when faced with conflict; hence, his state of stupor is glorified to heroism which is probably why a few teens and young adults think that it's cool to mimic Napoleon's character.There are some amusing scenes.

After turning it off the first time because it was unwatchable, i came back a few days later to try watching it again. But this movie is just a failure. It tries to be quirky and witty, but it fails miserably.  The acting is not really acting, its just monotone reading of lines. That would be fine with me - and even acceptable as an eccentricity - but there are just no redeeming qualities to make you accept its shortcomings. It offers no insights into how that geeky crowd lives, nor does it resonate if you were that geek.  It is an MTV picture, and it really shows - this movie tries too hard and comes up short.

It's worth checking out anyway.  One of the funniest things about this movie is one of the supporting charactors.  There is a girl that Pedro takes to the dance, and later Napoleon starts to date...its one of the daughters from that icky Meg Ryan movie where Meg plays a drunk and her husband is a pilot and he is trying to hold the family together, etc.  Forgot the name of it.  Oh yeah, its called ""When a man loves a women.""  Anyway, one of the little girls in that movie, one that Meg kicks around when she is drunk, is in this movie, and of coarse has grown up a bit since then.  See if you can recognize her.If you liked something like ""Welcome to the dollhouse"" then you might like this one.  There is just a lot of really random crazy stuff happening in it.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AN9TQHIF7W4O0	Spyder	At first I wondered where this flick was going. But if you sit through this and focus, there is a point. The main character, Napoleon does seem like a totally socially inept nerd. But somewhere deep inside this kid has a SOUL He longs to connect. He's not a bad person. He's trying to rise above the swamp that his life is, and to some small extent, succeeds. His romantic interest, Deb, seems a little inept herself, but she has a degree of quiet charm about her, and she is trying to make a life for herself. All the main characters are struggling for a little bit of happiness, and to some extent succeed, even Grandma who has a boyfriend and rides ATV's.The ending is a vaguely happy one, and if these losers can grab a little joy in life, well hell, so can the rest of us.And don't forget to keep watching after the final credits, as there is about 5 more minutes of movie left.	4.0	More Than Meets the Eye	2006-08-27	4	2	2

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3EFZZY5DUHLVS	"S. Rudge ""Always Even Steven"""	"Roger Ebert must have been having a bad day when he reviewed this film, because he completely whiffed this one.There is a great deal more to Napoleon Dynamite than may appear with one viewing.Every once in awhile, a movie comes along that demonstrates an understanding of humanity that is profound.  I believe this is one of those movies.On the surface it is a funny movie about nerdy kids and their daily lives.  The movie is not laugh out loud funny, nor is it a ""nerd kids strike back at the system"" formula movie.  There are no Hollywood stars or Hollywood pretentiousness.  The story is small, local, evenly paced and engaging.Beneath the surface there is an important message about the inherent nobility and value possible in every human being, no matter what their surface appearance.Napolean is pushed around and mocked by classmates, but he seems to accept it as part of his existence.  He seems perfectly content with who he is and seems to, accurately, believe the problems are with who everyone else thinks he is.  When he has the opportunity to ""pay back"" those humiliating him, he does it in an entirely creative and satisfying way.  There is no violence and no humiliation in his response to his peers.  He wins because he demonstrates nobility, talent and loyalty to his friends that raises him above those who demean him.  He uses his inate humanity to shine a bright light on the shallowness of those that would place themselves above him.His friends and relatives, each on the surface a ""loser,"" get the opportunity to individually rise above the audiences automatic expectations of their ""loser-ness"" and become fully important and credible people.I would highly recommend this film as an excellent family film, especially for families with kids in middle school and high school. The film asks you to examine your perceptions of others around you.  Are you one of the people who mock those who you perceive as nerds, or are you more like Napolean?  Perhaps a little of each?  Either way, the movie is a refreshing affirmation of the best aspects of humanity and hopefully you can watch it and apply its lessons to your own life."	5.0	This is an important movie!	2005-02-12	14	13	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3DY46ZABF4CMQ	"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer"""	"Napolean Dynamite is the sleeper hit of the year.A tale of an absurdly unpopular kid named Napolean Dynamite who lives around losers; his brother who spends his entire time on the internet chatting with his ""girlfriend"" who he has never met in person, his uncle who hasn't got over the loss of a football career 20 years past and shoots himself on camera throwing some lousy passes, his grandmother who goes on motorcycle ventures, a girl interest who has a pony tail on one side of her head, and a friend named Pedro who does not speak good english and goes out 'building' cakes for girls he wants to ask out to the dance and later runs for class president against the most popular blonde in the school. Pretty much, all the characters in Napolean are wierdos! But that's what makes them likable, and that's what makes the viewer not take the movie seriously and just laugh it away.However, the movie does end with a nice resolution for all the characters' deficiencies. The movie wraps with the class presidential campaign where Napolean gives his remarkable dance and blows everybody away!All the actors in the movie are unknown or just not famous. This movie will change that for most of them including John Heder, who plays Napolean.You know what, just watch this movie already, Gosh!!!B+"	4.0	This movie is good. Gosh!

I hated Napoleon Dynamite, but that's not saying you will, it's just my two cents.  It's one of those films where you have to like the main character or else you're screwed, coz you have to spend the duration of the film with him.  Some people feel this way about Woody Allen, some Jerry Lewis, to me it's Napoleon Dynamite.  Now I'm all in favor of films that show the underdog/outcast getting his/her shot at glory, and I also like to think I have a pretty broad sense of humor.  This movie only seems to have one joke that they stretch out for 84 minutes-Look at the dorky guy looking dorky, saying and doing dorky things.  Dorky can be funny, but Napoleon is downright unpleasant, unlikable and unfunny.  Plus he has a dorky brother, dorky uncle and dorky semi-girlfriend, so we get to push the whole dorky joke even further.  There are alot of hypocrites who really like the Napoleon character and think he's cool, yet if this same guy went to your high school as opposed to being a movie character, you'd hate him.  Napoleon's friend, Pedro is from the Cheech and Chong school of funny.  If you like Mexican characters that speak as though they're stoned, drunk or just dumb, you'll find Pedro funny.  I just think he's a stereotype myself.  He's a live action version of Speedy Gonzales' drunk cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez.  I barely smiled at this film, let alone laughed.  Considering MTV productions had a hand in this ""independant"" feature, you can kinda guess what kind of humor we're talking about.  And seeing the MTV name attached to this film makes me worry about the future of independant films.  It has one or two chuckles(not surprisingly the laughs came from every character but Napoleon), and Napoleon's dance at the end was pretty well done, but it just didn't do it for me.  Already I've noticed the extremely annoying epidemic of people freely quoting from this film.  There's nothing worse than people quoting unfunny lines from an unfunny movie, then cracking up at their own joke.  You'll notice this happens with people who quote Monty Python and The Holy Grail(complete with rotten English accent), only difference being that Monty Python manage to be funny.  More than likely I'll be brushed off as one who ""just didn't get it"", but that's cool coz I'm sure I can think of many films you won't ""get"" either.

If you get a kick about mocking other people you classify as ""losers"" then you will like this movie.  Again and again reviewers have said that Napoleon getting hit in the head with a piece of steak (thrown by his uncle) while riding his bike which knocks his glasses off is the ""funniest"" part of the movie. The emotion it brings up in me is to tell the uncle to stick it and f___ off. So it was not funny for me to see someone get hit in the head. It was not funny to see the bullies abusing people in school, like when Napoleon is knocked against a locker (by a school thug, ironically called a ""cool kid"" by another reviewer) or another student is grabbed by the neck and has his head driven towards the floor like 7 or 8 times.  In my life, I had the school thug/bully grab me by the neck and tell me not to speak to him ever again or he would kill me (and I said nothing to him.)

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1LTJCQGRPTOTD	STEPHEN T. McCARTHY	"I was invited to my Sister's house yesterday to watch NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, a movie that I had heard many good things about.  The movie reviewer for our local paper, 'The Arizona Republic' (more appropriately called, 'The Daily Disappointment' by the former mayor of Prescott, Sam Steiger) proclaimed it the sleeper of 2004.  And that's a label that might apply to many of its potential viewers.  As the DVD was inserted into the player, and I settled onto the sofa, my 16-year-old Niece, Shannon, who had seen the movie previously, said, ""It's a pointless movie; it has no storyline.""  Oh, the wisdom that sometimes emanates from the mouths of babes!I contemplated some of the clever and funny ways I might review NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, but decided to tackle it from an angle I seldom employ : straightforward.  I suppose it's understandable why some kids (8 to 12 perhaps) might find this movie entertaining, but this review is a public service announcement for everybody else tempted to buy or rent this ""sleeper.""  QUESTION : Is it fair to harshly criticize a simple little comedy?  (A poor word to describe this movie, but one must categorize.)  ANSWER : Yes, because it asks for $20. of your money and / or 86 minutes of your valuable time!NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a movie without any ""skills"", but plenty of problems.  This is dynamite that only blows up in the viewer's face.PROBLEM #1 : I understand that the movie was originally a concept for a student film.  Well, the writer / director is STILL a student because he evidently doesn't understand the most rudimentary principles of filmmaking.  A movie needs a central conflict that propels the viewer from scene to scene.  This is something that most foreign filmmakers have also failed to grasp.  They're still trying to put books on film, and they usually bore because novels and movies are two different mediums with unique necessities.  It is possible for an episodic film to succeed, but this is exceedingly rare and requires that every scene be poignant and expand the viewer's understanding of the characters.  NAPOLEON DYNAMITE simply moves from one supposedly amusing skit to another.  The scenes lack dynamism and do not illustrate previously unexplored facets of the characters.  And that brings up another problem...THE CHARACTERS : The principal character, Napoleon Dynamite, could best be described as a two-toned dog : 'Goofy' with the hairstyle of a poodle!  It's fine to have an odd character or two, but you cannot entirely people your story with oddballs.  You must have one or two ""ordinary"" characters to balance the relationships.  Here, the only characters who are not overtly strange are simply one-dimensional bullies and snobbish school queens who appear only occasionally to act as a foil for the misfits.  Consider that great sit-com, 'THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW' : In the early days, Griffith played Andy Taylor as ""a heavy-handed rural clown,"" and it didn't really work; there were too many of that sort in the cast.  One day, Griffith said, ""I just realized that I'm the straight man.  I'm playing straight to all these kooks around me.""  The next season he downplayed his character, becoming the true heart and soul of the show.  NAPOLEON DYNAMITE has no heart and soul; it is just a bunch of kooks in search of a story.  And unbelievable kooks at that.  (The scenes between LaFawnduh and Kip were preposterous in the extreme.  And Kip - what a cool name for such a doofus.  The Kip I know is intelligent, witty, wise, and...oh, yeah...humble!)Sure, there were a few nice moments that elicited a smile or a snicker or two from me.  They did manage to convey that sense of insecurity and social ineptitude of young people (especially through the monosyllabic dialogue).  Seeing Napoleon step out of his cocoon and daringly help his friend Pedro at the school assembly was the one moment in which we see some sort of genuine growth in a character.  The shot of Napoleon practicing his dance moves through his partially closed bedroom door was the one artistic flair that got my attention.  Nicely done.  And I did appreciate the fact that here was a movie without the customary nudity, and over-the-top profanity and violence.  But it takes more than that to justify spending an hour and a half of my time in front of the ""Lobotomizer.""It's clear to me that Hollyweird is now officially out of ideas.  The Hollyweirdos have been reduced to making movies based on comic books (Superman; Batman; Spiderman, et. al.), TV shows (The Brady Bunch; The Honeymooners; Bewitched), remaking movies that don't need any remaking (Born Yesterday; The Longest Yard; The Bad News Bears), and trying to pass off student movies as genuine films (Napoleon Dynamite).  Don't be fooled : NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is nothing more than a low-budget student movie that pretends to make some sort of statement, and imagines itself to be a ""film""; it's an invisibly small-scale story that desires to be thought of as something bigger and more important.  Kind of like that other Napoleon."	2.0	"""A MOVIE WITHOUT ANY SKILLS"""	2005-08-01	8	4	4

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of those movies which should only be seen once. The main character, Napoleon Dynamite, becomes annoying 2/3's of the way into the film. Basing the movie around him becomes the film's major problem. John Heder does what he can with the character, but doesn't succeed much.However, the film does feature fascinating supporting characters. The best character is Pedro, who is one of the best low-key comedic characters I've ever seen. The actor does a commendable job. The rest of the cast is also fascinating, and makes the film bearable.The DVD also features extras that, like the film itself, only require one viewing. If you're interested in low-key comedies, then this film is for you.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AWQ094FM9FVYT	"Stutz ""Culture Consumer"""	"A large number of people apparently hate this movie.  How can you hate something completely original?  If you're going to hate something, at least hate ""From Justin to Kelly"" or ""Spy Kids 3D"" or ""Monster-In-Law"".  I understand not liking it.  I didn't like the original ""Matrix"" when it came out, but I gave it originality points at least, and I understood why people might like it.  ND is assuredly NOT the worst movie ever.  I happened to like it very much.  It's surely quirky, and it's pretty deadpan.  I've read two reviews already that disagree and that name ""Airplane"" as real deadpan.  Well, you can define it how you want, but I'd call ""Airplane"" and ""Holy Grail"" (both great movies) more absurdist and silly than deadpan.  The ability of the characters to keep a straight face and of the film to feign seriousness is not necessarily deadpan in my book, but ND, on the other hand, takes itself absolutely seriously.  There is no implied wink-wink at the audience.  Others who've defended the film, and some who don't, are right to say that there is nothing to ""get""; it just is.  ND exists in an absolutely serious world not very much unlike our own.  That world, inasmuch as it's a mirror of our own  and expertly highlights certain quirky, hilarious aspects of it, makes for an engrossing little film that simply cracks me up.  I suppose that if you can't find anything recognizable to relate to in ND, then maybe you won't ""get it"".  Or maybe you're just being stubborn.  The reaction to ND reminds me of ""Titanic""--most everybody liked it until it became a cultural phenomenon, and then there was a big backlash, especially from those who saw it after everybody else, in the post-phenomenon stage (usually on the recommendation of people who saw it pre-phenomenon).  I'm not ashamed to say I liked ""Titanic"" a lot when I saw it (opening day), and I loved ND just the same."	5.0	You've forced me to post...	2005-07-01	7	5	2

Jon Feder in this movie reminds me a lot of one of my ex-colleagues (in a good way), which makes watching this quite strange. Napoleon's eccentricities are all so amazingly weird that by the time we get to the end we're really truly relived to see his transformation - and my jaw nearly dropped when I saw it achieved. Skits tied together don't always turn out well, but this little film sort of has what it takes to stretch out to full length. My own high school experience was more like Napoleon Dynamite than other films like American Pie (good grief). The internet romance between Kip and Lafawnduh is a bit unlikely, as is the weirdness of ""Uncle Rico"" being Napoleon's guardian (Jon Heder was 27 when Napoleon Dynamite was filmed) is a stretch, but it's all in good fun.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A22RGEI19Z9AEV	Susan Byers	"I am amazed at how many reviewers complain about this movie being boring, or accuse it of being pointless and plotless with ""nothing happening.""  True, there isn't a hugely climactic arc to the film (the somewhat listless ending could be one of its main , small, flaws), but it isn't a static movie by any stretch of the imagination. It has the rhythm of ordinary life, rather than the high-octane career of a car chase. I challenge anyone to isolate a few months' period out of their lives, and try to find the ""point"" in it.  There may not be one obvious, but we can agree that plenty happened.As other reivewers have mentioned, the movie is really one long chuckle, full of both subtle jokes and broad slapstick. I think it appeals to some people the way abstract art, jazz, free verse, and gamelan appeal to some and drive others to distraction. I've heard viewers from semi-high brow types to typical 10th graders rave about the film, suggesting it doesn't hit too many false notes if you aren't expecting it to be a heart-pounder.Some reviewers claimed that there was no character development, and rather than just a matter of taste, I believe that is simply not an accurate assessment. From Napoleon to Pedro (that smile was like the sun rising) to Deb to Kip to Uncle Rico, all the main characters evolved and changed. There was far more emotional movement in this film than in my current least-favorite film, Mystic River, unless you consider being killed or killing an old friend character development.I would rate this film between 4 and 4-1/2 stars. I think the directors could use a little more experience, but this is a fantastically entertaining debut, and has a genuine sweetness to it."	4.0	Settle down, relax and enjoy the ride	2005-01-29	4	4	0

When a movie sets out to show realism in it's truest form, no movie does it quite like Napoleon Dynamite. This movie, though it has little rising action, was captivating through it's unorthodox approach to story format. The comedic sense of the writers for this movie is very avant-garde.

""napoleon d."" does get a little heavy handed with 80s retro, which, while never cloying, makes me slightly leery of MTV's (the producers of this movie)smarmy calculation with the 80s retread phase going about these days(the movie even contains a time machine set for 1982).  but i'm happy to say that even though this is an ""MTV Film"", it's not a turd, but pretty great.there is a very flat feeling to the whole movie, but not in a bad way. it reminded me of herzog's ""heart of glass"", where the cast was hypnotized before shooting the rushes.  while not aspiring to ponder profound things like herzog, ""nap. d."" does dish out a lot of atmosphere.  just putting you into a time and place for a few hours.this is a good movie for people who are chill and don't have a chip on their shoulder and take themselves so seriously that that they run to their computer after they see a movie and flame everyone else for having an opinion contrary to theirs.i like black licorice movies because they inspire thought.  this could have been a typical movie, but i must admit, the teen misfit movie was given a new dimension here and i just recommend that people check it out.incidentally, i went to a rural high school, and i found a lot of the movie to be spot on.  people get pretty quirky when there's nothing to do but drive around back roads and hang out with one's pals etc, not to mention when decent jobs of any kind are far and few between!  the ""locals"" are not abused here, but dealt with tenderly.  don't be so sanctimonious....like you've never laughed at trashy white people culture!!"	4.0	polarizers are usually interesting for relaxed film freqs	2004-12-30	6	5	1

A few of the cuts might have been helpful, but time is always an issue.The film from a technical standpoint has some very memorable scenes, well executed in many ways.  The acting isnt flat, but the characters are very socially awkward (extremely so) and I believe that, mixed with the setting of the Main Character's home and ""style"" makes this movie difficult for some.  I know some of my students couldnt figure out a time frame, thinking it was in the early 80's, but its a matter of missing the setting and character traits.  Pay attention.Plot:  Teen movie of loner who doesnt fit in, finds a friend, finds romance, wins the day.  The interesting dynamic is that he stills stays within himself, transforming himself within the confines.  Instead of stepping into new territories and new identity, he retains who he is and gains ""skills.""  Its the misconception of the acquiring of skills that's funny.  Look at the culture and the role models.Laugh out loud moments you've seen, but there are better ones in it not seen.  Some lines are obviously going to be picked up by HS crowd and repeated and repeated, and frankly, that's sad because it turns people away.Would I recommend it: YES  Should you Buy it: that's a tough one.

When my friend made me see this movie, I had never heard of it, but once i'd scene it, I loved it. It was funny, strange, and has a large number of people who either love it, or hate it. I suppose it all depends on your sense of humor.In a way, it's hard for me to understand why some people seem to dislike the characters so much. It kind of seems like your not even supposed to like them, and to me, that makes them loveable in their own weird way. Napoleon seems to have this idea that the popular kids are the ones who are losers, which in this case, they are. Sure he's kind of a jerk sometimes, but how do you expect someone to be that has never really had someone be nice to him.Another thing that I've heard people say about this film, is that Napoleon is an unbelievable character. Sadly, I have to disagree. I have know someone almost exactly like Napoleon, weird afro, and all. He was also a jerk and thought everyone else was kind of a loser. He was treated just like  Napoleon by his peers. To me, this movie was very truthful about people and even though it's presented in a strange, yet delightful way, it is a movie worth watching.	5.0	Strange...	2005-01-01	2	2	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1IHD5OPYNWHGR	thealater	"I really like this movie and the charachters in it.  I even bought the dvd, and I don't own many.  Especially ""comedies"".When I first watched Napoleon, the blandness and the rudeness took me by surprise at the beginning.  And the immaturity.  I didn't see the appeal of the film at all.  Then, Napoleon danced.  To help his friend, Pedro.  You sense he didn't want to do it and wasn't sure about what to do, but he did it anyway and didn't hang around afterwards to soak in any glory or appreciation for himself. And the film let Pedro have his moment of disbelief and astonished joy. He comes alive.  Then, I liked Napoleon much better.  Whenever I have a bad day, I watch the dance and Pedro's reaction afterwards.  Everything else up that occurs up to that point becomes almost forgivable, because under all the pettiness there is a heart to this movie.  Which almost got lost. If it wasn't for Pedro and Nap's friendship, the movie would have been a zero.What would have made it better?  I think more depth with why Napoleon was so frustrated with life and relationships in his family.  He's still half asleep even at the film's conclusion.  I'm not asking for him to be drastically changed, but for at least for the poor fellow to gain some self awareness or lesson learned from his ordeal with life.I did like LaFawnduh.  I keep reading how there is no sex in this movie.  The relationship she had with Kip was full of chemistry, which saved it from teetering between ""yew"" and too cutesy.  The fact that he took off with her was centered completely on sex.  Although Kip finally developed in that aspect of his life, it didn't mean that he grew up. It remains to be seen if LaFawnduh becomes another substitute for Grandma, or if Kip steps up to the plate and delivers on his potential under LaFawnduh's positive influence.Deb was perfect.  I liked the fact that film gave her a chance to tell Napoleon off, even though she was mislead by Uncle Ric. It's good to know she was learning to speak her mind instead of running off. And that Nap was willing to take responsibility and make amends with her with a ""freshly caught bass"" even though Uncle Ric was ruining his life.  I was hoping that Deb's poise and maturity was softening Napoleon's rough edges.So, I enjoyed it, but it could have been a better movie."	3.0	Good, but could have been better	2005-11-25	1	0	1

Not exactly guerrilla filmaking.The MTV/Rolling Stone syndicate, as I like to call them, have decided that we're all ga-ga over this ""80's retro revial"" trend they created, and Napoleon Dynamite is tailor made to cash in on the craze. So, since they decide what's cool, I guess this movie is, in that respect. This is basically a John Hugues rip-off, except there's nothing endearing about it. Like most pop-culture filth, it's a pastiche of marketable icons and cliches.Personally, I felt insulted by these wealth-addicted suits at MTV thinking they had a right to make a buck with yet another ""nerd in highschool"" movie. I think just about everyone had a hell of a time in school, and to have some corporation SELLING my own life (though I wasn't as bad as Napoleon - I hope) back to me makes me wanna take a flame-thrower to the next douchebag I see with his hair combed to the side, and too-tight thirft store threads, if you catch my drift.About the only redeeming part of this movie is the car the cholos were driving.

Napoleon is not so nerdy that he's funny.  that is just another excuse for laughing at this lame movie because everyone else says it's funny.  and for all you ""intellectuals"" who want to justify laughing at this show, don't give me that sh-- about all the subtle humor.  there isn't any.  don't try to argue, there just isn't."	1.0	SUCKED THE BIG ONE!	2005-02-04	16	4	12
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2VGV2WOEPDPRW	The Curmudgeon	This is an odd film about odd characters and has now apparently achieved a cult status.  It's been years since I've seen it but the basis is the following.Dynamite is the nerdy main character and his main connection to the American mainstream is attending high school in rural Idaho.  He is surrounded by odd characters who are always trying some trick to get ahead, everything except hard work or study.  Eventually Dynamite runs into the second main character in high school, who could be an illegal alien from Mexico but the movie never identifies his status.The movie ends up being a version of the traditional American high school saga where outsiders like Dynamite and his Mexican friend confront insiders like the head cheerleader or the football team captain.  The ending is predictable but the movie is memorable because of its oddity.	5.0	CULT STATUS	2013-12-07	0	0	0

I watched the filming of this movie during the month of July the summer it was filmed in Preston. My grandson attended most of the filming hoping to be seen in the movie. He is in quite a few scenes. A couple of days before the last day of filming I was invited to be the secretary in the high school scene. (a job I held for 17 years). It has been a fun experience especially when we travel and people find out we were in the movie.  If they like the movie, we tell them we were in it. If they didn't like it we just move on. Their loss! When I say &#34;we&#34;, my husband was with me in the wedding scene and the other person I travel a lot with is the teacher who tells Napoleon on the stage that he needs a skit. Anyway it has been a great adventure. I live across the street from the Llama, Tina and we have had a lot of people stop in to talk about the movie. Lyle, the man who killed the cow lives less that a mile away and I still take family and friends to meet him. Most of the pranks and etc. were actual experiences that took place in Jared's family with his five brothers.	5.0	My experiences with Napoleon Dynamite.	2013-12-15	1	1	0

If this is how people are in Idaho I will NOT be visting soon.The acting is lifeless.  Some have found that funny but not me.  It scares & saddens me to think that Hollywood can put out this pathetic drool & people actually love it.  There is very little plot & you never develop a caring for any of the characters.  I laughed once through the whole movie.  That is a waste of 90 minutes. (180 really - read below)But I will gladly spend five minutes to hopefully prevent you from buying this film.  I just saw 'Nacho Libre' it was done by the same producers & it too was AWEFUL .  Must be some bad stuff goin round Hollyweird these days because their idea of a comedy has really taken a nosedive with this movie being the biggest crash of them all.The lead character has no depth of emotion.  And the other characters in the movie are but sideshows for the giant dork.  I know when I date one of my first questions will be how she liked this film. If she liked it even a little I will be heading down the road. I cannot grasp the kind of mind that finds this dribble funny.Bored out of my mind & stupified from watching this movie twice (as recommended is some ealier reviews) got me to thinking about some reviews comparing this movie to 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'.  NOT even close.  That was a FAR FAR superior movie.Again I URGE you to rent this movie first.  If you like it, buy it.  If you HATE it like I did thank me in your prayers this evening.  If this is what 60 % of out country finds amusing I am truly concerned for our future as a society.PS And PLEASE do NOT click the ""Did Not Find Helpful"" Box just because you disagreed with my opinion of this cinematic disaster.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ALQIJDD4FA5M0	The Gadfly	"This has got to be one of the most penetratingly funny movies I've ever experienced. Yes, it is an experience. The subtle genius is that the characters in this movie are so real because they possess characteristics we all readily recognize. Uncle ""Glory Days"" Rico, Kip the computer bound shut-in, Rex the overly aggressive, small minded, ""business man"". Then there are the jerks at the high school including the arrogant, big-fish-in-a-little-bowl, cheerleader and wannabe class president, Summer. How many times have we seen those people in our everyday lives? Then there's the butchy looking grandma and the blatant mispronunciation of Mexican food names. Uncle Rico with his get-rich-quick-schemes. Anything sounding familiar yet? And of course, there's Pedro, the innocent, even keeled and socially detached teenage Mexican who serendipitously slogs through the high school social strata to ""make all your dreams come true"". This is one of those few films that left me thinking about it for days afterwards. I still find myself quoting much of the movie with my kids and wife and laughing.

When I watched the movie, I didn't even laugh. No, I don't have a bug up my ass, I just didn't find the movie that funny. I just don't get how some douchebag saying ""You're such a flippin' idiot, gosh"" in a low-strained voice is that hilarious. The disappointment of the movie not being so great was bad enough. Then everybody around school starting quoting the movie constantly, which got really annoying. Sorry folks, but it's not funny when other people quote movies, because it's not original.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2CCMDEZSWKMGQ	The Judge of the Value of all Entertainment & Art	"This movie is one of my favorites of 2004 and all-time, despite my having low expectations before watching it.Even a levelheaded viewer who didn't enjoy this film would have trouble claiming that it was ""flawed."" The execution is pretty much perfect -- there are no throwaway lines, all of the loose ends in the plot tie back to each other, and every character has a genuinely satisfying arc. Despite the surreal nature of these characters and the world they live in, I really did care about their fate and was touched by the ways in which their lives unfolded. In any movie, let alone a comedy of this nature, that is a tremendous accomplishment.The problem is, though, that some people simply will not want to watch these characters for two hours. They are very strange and awkward, and while I myself found all of them except for villain Uncle Rico to be likable, it's understandable that some folks might be left scratching their heads and wondering what the fuss is about.With that disclaimer, I will move on to the movie's rating. This is one of very few PG movies I have ever seen that is worth watching. Usually, if you see ""PG"" on a box, you can expect braindead kiddie films that will harm young viewers more than any nudity or violence ever could. This, though, was immensely creative, intelligent, and funny. If you're a parent concerned about content, but also want your child to develop a respectable sense of humor, this should be the first disc you drop into your DVD player for the little ones.One last note for those who liked the movie but might be on the fence about buying it: the actual DVD is a great purchase loaded with extras. With commentary, the original short film that the feature is based on, deleted scenes, and both widescreen and full screen versions, you are getting your money's worth."	5.0	Absolutely Unique and Wonderful	2005-01-14	5	3	2

Since it was successful in festivals, I wondered if it was going to be a dry, insufferable ""comedy"" like THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, perhaps the most overrated, pretentious film I've ever seen.But NAPOLEON is funny.  The characters are so off-the-wall that the story looks like pure chaos for the first half.  But there is a story and it's fun to watch it all come together.

Got there & was told they heard of a great movie we ALL were going to watch. Heard the name & I was like 'OH NO, I just saw that & it was terrible'. However, wanting them to form their own conclusion along with my kids & theirs (who had no idea I HATED THIS), we watched it. I kept my mouth shut the entire movie. My brother, sister in law, neices/nephews & my kids, along with 3 of the kids friends thought this was awful. The entire movie, all they did was rag on it & say it was 'STUPID' the entire flick. 'STUPID' was an adjective I used but never mentioned so I got quite a laugh hearing adults & 7 kids all use the same adjective, along with many more non flattering ones. & sorry to say, it was just as AWFUL watching it the 2nd time as it was the 1st. What really threw me was this is supposed to be a G rated 'family' flick, & I guess in theory it certainly is.....But needless to say us adults were quite off guard when the KIDS starting making comments about how the characters ALL LOOK STONED...Yep...KIDS made these comments!Anyway, just thought id edit this & add the above as not 1 of us liked this flick & ALL OF US thought it was HORRIBLE/STUPID...pick your most unflattering adjective & add it in....Even ALL the kids hated this.I know with movies everybody has different tastes but every now & then you see a flick leaving you wondering how anybody could have liked it. This is it!!! Again, I know everybody has different tastes & I respect the fact some liked or even loved this flick...but it still leaves me wondering how anybody could like this stupid tripe. IT WAS REALLY THAT BAD.....--------------------------------------------Saw this on tv. Saw it had 3.5 star rating which means excellent from my provider. Saw the reviews here which were pretty gapping. Not many 'in the middle'. Most are either 5 star or 1 star, meaning most either loved or hated it.Put me in the hated it camp.Yes, I forced myself to watch it & although I kept wanting to turn it off, I gave in & watched it all.I wont say this is the worst movie I ever watched but its high on the list.This flick was simply one of the most absurdly boring & 'stupid' flicks I have ever seen. While I fully understand everybody has different tastes, im still a bit shocked that anybody actually liked this ridiculous tripe.But please, watch it for yourself & form your own conclusion, as I did.But yep, If I tried listing everything I HATED about this flick, I'd be typing for hours. It was that HORRIBLE!!Glad some liked it, but for the life of me I cant comprehend why. One of the most boring & stupid flicks i've ever watched!	1.0	Absolutely S*CKED!	2013-01-09	14	2	12

The scenes are punched up nicely with the includsion of a seasoned-nerd older brother and maudlin, pseudo-sports hero ""uncle"".If you weren't laughing in the first 15 minutes of this rare type of comedy, you're probably better suited with a Jim Carey or Pauly Shore movie."	5.0	You have to like the understated to enjoy this.	2005-01-04	0	0	0

She laughed, but AT Napoleon, in a kind of dumb-founded way that was always wondering what he was going to do next.  I laughed too, but because I've always rooted for the misfit, for the underdog, for the loner.  For the secret, naive-moron that we all are deep-down.  Whether it was drawing expertly-shaded pictures of the beautiful Trisha or giving a report on the exploits of our ""underwater ally"" (Nessie), I felt like I endured a million hours of junior high and high school with him sitting in the back of the class.I'm a professional firefighter, and I brought the DVD into work the next day.  Before we watched it, I was concerned that it would have too much ""dork appeal"" for a bunch of alpha-male men-of action.  But it soon dawned on me, as the room exploded in laughter again and again, that Napoleon was not so much a dork as he was a little boy who never really grew up.  And almost every man can remember what it was like to be 8 years old.The smarmy ""Summer Wheatley"" and her unctuous boyfriend looked like real people I went to school with.  That guy could've been a blonde version of Sherwin Adams from my class of 1993.  It was not difficult to want to see them fall from grace, especially at the hands of the dynamic and well-coiffed Pedro.The dance scene climax gave me chills to watch, because it reminds us that even the awkward, even the graceless, even the silly or stupid or ugly can do something well.  Can do something to admire, even to the point of being envious of it.This is a sweet, funny, unconventional film made by unorthodox people who poured their brains and heart into it.  You will laugh your head off at this movie, or it will miss you completely.  Like ""Bottle Rocket"", you cannot explain what is funny about it.  Kudos to Jack White for allowing them the use of the White Stripes song ""I think we're going to be friends"".Oh, keep watching after the credits, there's about 5 additional minutes of movie left.

Like many reviewers have said: either love it or hate it. I definitely have a sense of humor, but I really don't understand what was so cool or funny about this movie. Maybe had I been involved in the production of it I'd find enjoyment but it just wasn't my cup of meat!The acting was overkill. Better than your average B-movie, but they all just tried too hard. Napoleon and Pedro were the most annoying, most unbelievable characters I've ever seen. I've known a lot of dorks and dweebs in my life, but these guys were just stereotypical nerdage pushed beyond what was acceptable to me; no one is that dorky, come on!The plot was pathetic beyond any sense of logic. Maybe I should smoke a joint and try watching it again for it to make sense. Following some dork around who spits out lame lines that everyone quotes, only to have no real change in the end, was a huge letdown and made the movie worthless to me.The only saving grace was the dorky dance toward the end. Reminded me of the talent show in Revenge of the Nerds.The bonus features were 1000x's better than the actual movie. You're honestly better off renting this movie and just watching that.I can see how this became popular, as my generation is moving along and the new batch is coming forth, trying to make their impact in today's society. This movie (seems to me) tries to stamp itself as a classic similar to Fast Times At Ridgemount High or The Breakfast Club, just with a different formula. Maybe it's just that it's too different for me and I don't get it.Bottom line: this movie is just way overhyped. Only rent it to say you've seen it.

If you grew up in the 80's or early 90's then you can relate to the dialogue, and the various situations (reading a current event, being part of a ""happy hands"" club) that occur in this kid's school. The directors do such a great job in making the set and the dialogue as authentic as possible. This movie puts me straight back into my childhood every time Napoleon calls someone a ""friggin idiot"" or ""retarded"". If you can't relate to the humor, you will have a hard time watching Napoleon Dynamite.

(Both films are MST3k fodder; I am referring to the non-MST treated originals - obviously, the MST treatment turns these into comedy classics and invalidates this comparison.)Basically, this movie is about as far from Three O'clock High (possibly the best down/out teen nerd comedy in this vein - i.e, dry as opposed to the superb Better Off Dead's more wacky approach) as one can get.Avoid this movie.

Here they are:1.""I can't believe how boring and pointless that movie was.""2.""That movie was so stupid it's funny. I could've made a movie like that.""3.""That was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time!""A small group of people end up in the, ""Yeah, it was kinda funny"" group. In other words, if you still haven't seen this, chances are you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it. When I walked out of the theater after watching this film I said to my wife, ""That was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time."" I watch about a movie a month.A lot of the people in the first group tend to complain of  the movie's lack of plot. Many of these same people also claim that those of us who enjoyed this movie did so at Napoleon's expense- i.e. we laugh because we feel superior to him (see the above Amazon review.) I disagree with both notions. The plot certainly is simple and it's often obscured by the near continual stream of one-liners and gags. But there is a story here. It's about a nerdy kid and his nerdy friends who end up achieving more  than they  ever expected to and make themselves happy along the way.But few people, if any, are going around telling their friends to see this movie because of the great feel good story. Most people that enjoyed this film enjoyed it because they laughed so hard at all the gags and one-liners. I know I did.But I wasn't laughing because I felt superior to Napoleon and all the real life people he represents. I laughed because  I know, to a degree, what it's like to be Napoleon. I sat in class drawing ""medieval warriors"" and whatnot. I set up plywood ramps on the sidewalk in front of my house to ride my bike over. I remember regarding the popular girls as some sort of unattainable goddesses, and the dudes they hung around with as meathead jocks. I'm not alone here, and I'm not trying to portray myself as part of some sort of nerd elite. Most people can relate to what I'm talking about. Yeah, the character of Napoleon took the whole idea to an extreme. But would the movie have been funny if it didn't? Of course not.So if you haven't seen this movie and you're wondering whether you'll like it, be aware that the humor is simple and the story is simpler. And don't feel guilty for laughing at Napoleon. Odds are you or someone you know probably have a little in common with him.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A289NBYVMII066	T. J Mitchell	I picked up a copy of this movie basically because I had a gift certificate to cash in and I had seen it advertised when it was playing at my city's trendier venues. There was definitely a deliberate quirkiness to the characters that seemed a bit formulaic in the indie/cult genre and was rather annoying at first. Creating characters so cartoonishly geek ridden and over the top for its own sake is simply not enough to carry a movie. I just hope the next generation of such films doesn't resort merely to funky hair, tacky clothes, and a spazoid demeanor and merely ride those JC Penny coattails. That being said, I have to admit Aaron Ruell's Kip character really grew on me like a matted down fungus. I can't get his lame poetry, weak nasal speech, and bad posture out of my head. I actually worked with someone who was eerily similar and planned to buy a missile silo so, in that sense, his character was believable. Also, kudos to Tina Majorino for taking a break from the pratfalls of the child actress to come back with a valiant effort as a relatively invisible high school student.As for the plot, hmmmm. What actually happened? Napolean gets Pedro elected class president, wins the cute wallflower, and his brother Kip, transformed into a hip hop philosopher, leaves town with his internet babe LaFawnduh. Even Uncle Rico is joined by some oddly intrigued cameo babe while videotaping himself throwing the pigskin in a field. There were no real unconventional surprises or groundbreaking plot twists, but in all this movie was amusing enough on the merits of its quirkiness.	3.0	your sandy hair floats in the air...	2005-02-11	1	0	1

I hate, hate, hate hipper-than-thou indie films, and I thought this was one.  I was very wrong.  I laughed out loud from beginning to end.The movie works because you like Napoleon just enough to root for him, but not so much that you feel badly for him.  He's a nerd, sure, but he's also kind of a jerk.  He hits like 3 people in the movie and never gets hit himself.  He's not a pathetic character, though you expect him to be, given typical movie stereotypes.  The understated performances are just perfect, and the little details make the movie.	5.0	This Movie is SWEET!	2005-05-16	7	3	4

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A176IA89VGH46M	Todd Bovair	...Between those who love this movie, and those who either hate it because its 'dumb' or they 'just don't get it'. I have  found that the overwhelming factor is AGE. Young people love this movie, and they GET IT. Its a funny movie, and it doesn't need to be explained. Older people seem to hate it, they don't understand it, they see no humor in it, they just don't get it. Now, here's the thing: I'm 35, and I LOVE this movie. You need to ask yourself, can you relate to some of the things kids enjoy today, or are you totally alienated from the youth of today? Your answer might be a good indicator of whether you will like Napoleon Dynamite or not. Even if you aren't young, if you are young at heart, GIVE THIS MOVIE A TRY! You may find it as entertaining as I did. For my money, it is one of the most original, creative, and charming movies to come down the pike in a LONG time. Its everything Hollywood is not these days.Napoleon Dynamite is not an OUTRIGHT comedy, there are no real slapstick moments or actual jokes, you have to be able to see the humor in mundane (even if slightly skewed) everyday life... And I TOTALLY disagree with Roger Ebert, I don't feel superior to Napoleon, I find the characters absolutely charming and powerful. Of course, Ebert is like 60 now, that tells me something right there...	5.0	A SERIOUS dividing line exists.....	2006-02-06	10	8	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1ISW6NMR45Y71	Tome Raider	"This movie is disconcerting because it approaches within a hair's breadth the classic heights of movies like ""Rushmore"" and ""Harold and Maude"" but falls short because it ends too soon.  There is never any final resolution, epiphany, or turning point.  It ends just as you've decided that you love the characters and really care about what happens to them. When the movie ends you find yourself asking: what happens next?  Who wins?  And about a dozen other questions that beg to be answered.The characters are indeed novel and hilarious.  The dead-pan humor is almost painful to watch it is so funny.  The performances are great by all involved.  My favorite was ""Kip""--Napolean's 32-year-old brother, but I was super intrigued by Kip's beautiful black girlfriend who he met on a web chatroom.  I wanted to learn a whole lot more about her, she is a very intriguing character. She definitely has bad taste in men, because Kip is about the biggest loser to ever walk the planet!  Uncle Rico was a classic with his football fantasies and sales schemes. So was Granny, who we basically only saw two times, the last time flying off her ATV.Napolean is a fascinating character.  He is different from most nerds: he is comfortable with who he is; one might even say he is brazenly confident.  I like that, he is a truly unique individual.  His little dance in front of classmates took a lot of...confidence, and I think that's why the kids cheered. My favorite scenes, however, were when Napolean is feeding his llama.  That was very amusing.Unfortunately, the plot never quite went full circle.  I was waiting for the climax, which was never forthcoming.  But this movie, when all is said and done, is a must-see.  It is an almost-classic.  It is a bittersweet movie, because it approaches the realm of the great, and just misses it. It reminds you how quirky people can be, and how even odd-balls can be likeable.  And, it shows you that even if you are an oddball, you have nothing to apologize for, because oddballs can be good people and have lots of fun as well."	4.0	Frustratingly Close to Excellent	2006-06-30	5	4	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1XYC4YZA77K3M	Tom	"Many people have commented here on the film itself, but I want to say that it's not so much the film, it's the whole experience (that a few people have touched on) that makes Napoleon Dynamite worth watching at least once, and maybe more than once.This movie is much funnier when remembered and quoted the next day.  My children are still quoting this movie many many weeks after having seen it, and I suppose that some of the funnier lines will become a part of their standard vocabulary.  We have all spent hours laughing with tears in our eyes from quoting various lines (there are WAY too many hilarious quotable lines to even start listing them), and it is surprising how many of them are applicable to life's everyday circumstances; just try to have a bad day after someone hits you with a Napoleon quote, it's hard not to laugh, especially if both of you have seen the movie.  Monty Python movies (particularly Holy Grail) are the only things that come close to Napoleon Dynamite in the ""quotable"" category.As a movie, it's not great, but as an experience that you can share with others and continue enjoying long after having seen it, it's virtually incomparable, and that's why this movie is SWEET!"	4.0	The Day After...	2005-06-28	3	0	3
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3EJVZ5LCBP61X	"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev."""	Within 20 minutes you will know if you're going to love or hate this film.  There is a general story line here:  a particularly nerdy high school boy stumbles through life, aware that he is often treated poorly, but apparently oblivious to his own idiosyncracies.  Various themes are touched upon:  family dysfunction, geeks get girls, and how self-confidence can overpower even near-constant peer negativity.Nevertheless, the enjoyment Dynamite offers is in the over-all effect of this clumsy, often clueless hero plowing through life, successfully overcoming a constant flow of obstacles.  In the end, good hearts win, and sometimes even jerks can find redemption.There is no doubt that this offering is quirky, quite weird, and will prove grating to some viewers.  Thus, my 4-stars is Ebert's 1.5.  Napolean Dynamite will either grow on you, or cause you to start pulling out your hair.Bottom-line:  To thine own self be true.  Either enjoy the ride, or bail out before you require Rogaine!	4.0	The World According to Napoleon	2005-11-23	3	1	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A38QJ7JUUTVLKX	"Tom Servo ""Robot"""	"People quote this movie way too much. It was hilarious when nobody knew about it, but now it's way to over quoted. Jared Hess makes an unforgettable directorial debut with NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, a hilarious, tender, and original portrait of a truly eccentric character. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a high-school outcast in every sense of the word. More interested in playing tetherball by himself and drawing pictures of his favorite animal, the ""liger"" (a combination of a lion and a tiger), Napoleon is ignored by everyone in his tiny hometown of Preston, Idaho. At home, things aren't much better. His uber-nerd older brother Kip and ultra-vain Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) are too busy with their own obsessions to give Napoleon the time of day. It isn't until a new student, Pedro, arrives that Napoleon finds friendship and performs an act of brave defiance that makes him a true hero. Written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE masterfully captures the awkwardness of high school without succumbing to condescension. Most of this can be attributed to Heder, who steps into Napoleon's moon boots with a jaw-dropping flawlessness. The rest of the cast is just as natural, underplaying their roles and letting the comedy unfold without forcing any of the jokes. This is also one of the most unusual movies ever to be told on film. People please quit quoting this movie! You're ruining it for others."	5.0	this was awesome when nobody knew about it.	2005-02-18	0	0	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3GRRDOYGIEZ45	"Tom Trails ""Tom Trails"""	I am 36 and loved this movie. Why 4 stars and not 5? Well, its not a masterpiece, but it delivers a lot of laughs with unknown actors, with good acting and poking fun at elements of American society that are never touched in most movies. The critiques some reviewers give are true: it has no plot, and the characters are all dimwits. But that doesn't mean it isn't hilarious. I won't badmouth the people who hated it, because my wife is one of them. This movie requires a certain sense of humor. If you have my wife's sense of humor, and think Shrek is really funny (I watched the entire Shrek 2 movie plus the DVD extras, and I think I laughed twice), then you won't appreciate this film. If you like silly/quirky humor like me, you will probably laugh a lot with this film. I like comedies that are silly, quirky and relatively clean. Some that come to mind are Airplane!, Three Amigos! and The Emperor's New Groove. If ridiculousness makes you laugh, there is plenty here. Rent it first, then if you like it, buy it to encourage the filmmakers to produce more. As for the acting, those who say these guys can't act somehow don't seem to realize that these actors are not the dopey people they seem to be in the movie. It takes talent to pull this off. These are not over-the-top Jim Carrey performances. These characters are completely believable, and I don't laugh at them, as one reviewer suggests, out of any sense of superiority, but because the things they do and say are so ridiculous and at the same time believable. I would eat lunch with Napoleon and Pedro any day, and I was never a nerd. Classic moments include Pedro shaving his head one afternoon when he realizes that his hair is making him hot, then realizing that his chances of winning the student body president spot will be hurt by his bald dome, so he gets a girl at school to find him a wig. The way these characters approach the whole ridiculous situation in a totally matter-of-fact, deadpan way is what makes it funny. They don't appear to see anything funny here. They're just reacting the best they know how to their circumstances. Most comedies, on TV and in the movies, are very predictable, with cute jokes and lots of grinning at the camera. If that's American comedy, this is the anti-comedy, about awkward people dealing with awkward circumstances in what seems to them a very logical way. I still love my wife, and she still loves me. Different people find different kinds of things funny. It's good to know there are a lot of others out there who enjoy this kind of more subtle but much more hilarious comedy.	4.0	I loved it, my wife hated it.

Apparently, everyone giving this movie 4-5 stars are all wrong. To me, it seems people say this is a good movie b/c its the cool thing to say. I thought the mannerisms of Napoleon were annoying, and if he were in my school, I'd kick his @ss too. If you have poor taste in eclectic comedies, then this one is for you. However, if your looking for intelligent, offbeat comedy, I would highly suggest ""Dead Man on Campus"" and ""Necessary Roughness"" as two of the more popular films in the genre.P.S.

What I found was a room full of fools watching this movie. This terrible movie! Where is the point in the actors, charactors, or worst of all for this lame excuse for a comedy: Where is the humor? In the behind the scenes someone boasts that ""We made a good clean cut comedy with nothing vulgar."" That is just an admittance that is wasint funny! I laughed only once. It was when napoleon failed his bike ramp, but that was because I thought he just died and the credits would roll! I was too lazy to get up and turn this (...) off. They say you need to watch it twice, which is when the secret subliminal rewiring takes root in you mind! You can watch Bob Saget a 1000 times andit only gets worse. Did he write this movie too?The point is this: ""why would you punish yourself again?"" This train of thought is why people in the future call you ""the generation we do not speak of"" ,bad apples taking dumps on film. This idea was sooooooooo simple and lacked any filler. A whole nation is bowing before their ""vision"" I could have written this film. So could you or anyone. Does that make it art? NO! But it makes it a gimmick! Now If you want magnificence, listen to some michael Bolton. People in the future cant get enough of the old recordings of our dictator! My grampa said everyone at his job begged him to see it. I told him that they were possibly trying to dupe him into blowing his weekly welfare budget, and they would all secretly laugh at him if he said it was a ""Funny"" movie.

The rural America that Napoleon Dynamite portrays, and the people in it, are very real, and immediately identifiable to anybody who has ever lived in a place like this.I think without having had some sort of common experience with the characters in this film, a lot of reviewers here dismiss it as a mean-spirited movie designed to mock geeks - but for those that lived in this sort of place, it's just the opposite.  It celebrates the wierdness, the oddity, and the awkwardness of a certain section of the high-school crowd.The cool kids at school? You barely notice them in NP - they're characterless, and barely there. And the nerds and geeks are unapologetic, living their wierd, interesting and quirky lives.I knew these people, and in part I WAS some of these people. Repeated viewings strengthen the strange sense of connection and - oddly - nostalgia for this place.It might seem unbelievable or strange to those who've never experienced such a world, but this is a pretty truthful movie - which is what makes it so great to many of those who love it.	5.0	Cinema Verite!	2006-03-19	9	8	1

According to the previews I thought it was going to be another movie about a nerd who is picked on and falls in love with the nice popular girl and the school likes him at the end of the movie.  But this wasn't another movie like that.  ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a quirky movie about a nerd who is a jerk yet has a soft spot.  The humor is really random, which brings up memories from movies like ""Airplane"" and ""Monty Python and the search for the holy grail"".  Napoleon's Uncle Rico is probably one of my favorite characters for he brings an extra sense of quirkiness and fun to the movie.  When Pedro runs for president you pull for him and you decide you want to hate Summer, and I died laughing when Napoleon did that dance for Pedro's campaign.

I was amazed to read of people that made it 35 minutes through the movie before turning it off out of utter horror/boredom/disdain.Many of them essentially said ""how can anyone like a movie where we're supposed to laugh at stupid boring losers"".  I guess that's the difference between loving and hating this film.  Napoleon is just a goofy guy who doesn't fit in with everyone.  I don't understand how that makes him a loser.  He doesn't want to come off as another boring high-schooler, so he brags about having bow hunting skills, hunting wolverines with a 12-gauge, and having a girlfriend who models in another state, but by the end of the movie he's dancing in front of the school, riding a horse, and just having a good time.Other than being hilarious, the movie is surprisingly tender.  Napoleon is loyal to Pedro, to his brother, and even ultimately to his Uncle.  Other moments:  When Pedro wants to impress a girl, he builds her a cake and leaves it by her door.  Napoleon wants to do the same, so he draws her a picture.  When Pedro is sick, Napoleon calls his place to see if he's okay.  Pedro's cousins give Napoleon and his date a ride to the dance.  Deb nervously tries to talk to Napoleon waiting outside of the school for a ride.  Kip somehow finds true love.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a hard movie to describe. It's sort of a teen comedy, but it's not the average teen comedy (especially one produced in part by MTV). There aren't many side-splitting one-liners or over-the-top-gross out gags. The foulest word in the film is either ""freaking"" or ""crap"". The only physical violence in the movie is done by high school bullies or a local martial arts master. There isn't any sex (heck there's hardly any sexual innuendo). The movie doesn't even really have a point.Yet, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE works and works exceedingly well. It's a hilarious movie filled with some extremely memorable characters. The characters are quirky and filled with foibles. Yet, bizarre as they appear, they are so realistic it's uncanny. Who doesn't know somebody like Uncle Rico? Had my maternal grandmother lived long enough, I bet she would have spent her weekends riding an ATV. Anybody else know somebody who thinks selling ""tupperware"" is a ""real job""? The characters in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE are people sliced out of the real-life heart of America.The story of the movie resolves around high schooler, Napoleon Dynamite. He has a 32 year-old brother, Kip, who sits around at home talking to girls on the internet 4-6 hours a day. The brothers live with their Grandma, who sneaks out to do extreme sports with her friends. Grandma gets hurt 4-wheeling on some sand dunes and Uncle Rico is sent to ""help"" the brothers while Granny recovers. Rico still lives in 1982, just before the big high school football game when the coach didn't put him in and they lost. There's a girl at school named Deb who runs her own photography studio who has a major crush on Napoleon, though he doesn't figure it out for the longest time. Napoleon's best friend is a recent immigrant student named Pedro. Pedro decides he wants to run for class president and the rest of the movie revolves around Pedro's campaign and what Napoleon does to help his friend.The actors in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE were pretty-much no names at the time the movie originally came out (Haylie Duff, sister to Hillary was, perhaps the biggest name at the time). Jon Heder, Tina Majorino (who played the girl with the map on her back in WATERWORLD), Aaron Ruell, Jon Gries, and Efren Ramirez are all excellent in their roles. In lesser skilled actors, their roles could have been spoofy, cheesy, or over-the-top. Instead, they grind their characters to reality.The movie has a lot of great scenes and lines and is destined to become one of the most quoted movies of all time (right up with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, TOMMY BOY, and STAR WARS). The movie also boasts a delightful soundtrack that includes everything from ""Time After Time"" to the ""A-Team Theme"" to ""I Want Candy"". As quirky as the film is, it contains some strong messages about the importance of family, sticking by your friends, following your dreams, and being the person God created you to be. All of that and chicken talons, too. In short, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is one of the most bizarre, but best films from 2004."	5.0	Wow!	2012-06-04	2	2	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AXKBYCNGV3J3J	TwainGirl	This is the best 'teen angst' film I've seen, and one of the best period. As someone who had the unfortunate experience of enduring 7th grade in Columbia Falls, Montana (pop. 4,000)...I feel this film right down to the fanny pack/moon boot ensemble, the perpetual corn dog cafeteria lunches, the evil 'big hair girls' (as I called them) and the nary foreigner kid who befriends the rest of the outsiders in school.I admired those outsiders, not for their smarts or 'knowing what it's like', but for their simplicity of just being and not giving a hoot on being popular. To me, this film seems to embrace that notion, while spontaneously filling you up with right-on-target irony and sarcasm and hilarious small-town satire that, you'd might just have had to 'be there too once' to *really* know.If you liked Welcome To The Dollhouse by Todd Solondz, you'll love this film just the same. The pure genius of these guys who pulled it all together- newcomer writer/director Jared Hess, and first-time actors Jon Heder and Aaron Ruell (who happens to be an amazing, hip photographer in real life)- is not only extraordinary, but inspiring for soon-to-be indie filmmakers as well.It's great to see a comedy like this that is far away from the usual Jim Carey/Jackass/Ben Stiller DreamWorks stuff that we are so bombarded with today.Brilliant!P.S. Don't forget to keep watching after the final credits roll.	5.0	I can't wait to see more from these guys!	2005-01-19	3	3	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3POUK5BO810DD	T. Wu	This movie is about a guy with no personality who constantly speaks in this extremely annoying sarcastic accent whenever spoken to, and at the end of the movie is does a crazy dance which somehow is meant to accomplish something significant, but is actually depressingly pathetic...which pretty much sums up this movie. I won't give it away unless you actually want to see it. But frankly, it wouldn't make much difference. Oh, high school angst, oh rural life, oh, making fund of stupid losers on film. All of these themes have been 'done' and done far better than this. Worst of all this film is clearly self-conscious and pretentious. It thinks that just because it is an 'indie' film somehow everything it does is clever: WRONG. Unfortunately, like the Emperor with no clothes it has taken quite a few people along for the ride, silently mocking them even as they enjoy their feelings of superiority over the characters in the movie. If you want to see a self-congratulating film that thinks it had achieved some kind of aesthetic epiphany, but actually just rehashes all the old formulas and cliches from '80s teen flicks, go ahead and see this.	2.0	Deliberate attempt at campy wittiness fails	2005-11-21	9	5	4

If that is the case then why is this movie being called by so many as one of the funniest movies in years.  The whole time I watched it I maybe chuckled once, and even that was probably forced.  This movie is dull, stupid, and ultimatly pointless.The story here is that Napoleon is a high school student who seemingly gets no respect.  He makes friends with a hispanic student who transfers in and a girl who one day tried to sell him crap.  After his guardian gets injured in a ATV accident his Uncle moves in to care for them, and all he can think about is a get rich quick scheme.  The movie drags along at an unbearably slow pace and ultimatly is not funny.I am told it gets better with repeat viewings but the question is, if the movie sucks to begin with, why watch it again.

Naploleon Dynamite is such a funny and memorable film. The characters are well developed and the overall quirky nature of the film works perfectly.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AE3P3M2R1RLZH	viktor_kgb	At the urging of my 13 year-old son, I sat and watched Napoleon Dynamite. It took about 15 minutes into viewing the movie before I realized there was no plot. However, this movie did not need one. It is an accurate portrayal of the ultimate high school dork. I'm 44 years old and the 'Napoleon' in my high school was named Louis Rocha. Sorry Louis but it's true, you were (and I'm assuming, still are) the biggest dork out there, GOSH! From the clothes, hairstyle, Moon Boots, and general demeanor, the portrayal of Heder as the 'Dork Extraordinaire' is exemplary. The lack of social interaction skills, and subsequent affiliation with other dorks is clearly right on target. I watched this film over and over again (got it for Xmas!), truly hilarious once you get over the lack of plot. The dance sequence is incredible! One more thing, one of our software engineers where I work is representative of Napoleon at 35 years old, however, he's balding now. Still has his Moon Boots too, seriously. Dorks, you gotta love them.	5.0	Remember the 'Napoleon' from your school?	2005-01-07	1	1	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	"Having no expectations I was pleasantly surprised by the power of this little film about nerds in search of a dream.Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the high school nerd who gets pushed around and taunted by the cool kids. He befriends a new kid Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and together they form a union that takes them into the political arena, running for school president against the most popular girl, Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff). But Napoleon must also deal with his missing Grandmother (Sandy Martin), his nerdier brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his haphazardly enterprising Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). With a subdued laugh a minute Napoleon's life is revealed with a bang.This little film may seem rather dull at first but once the Quaalude induced dark humor of the title character makes his point you will beg for more. Jon Heder is absolutely convincing as the buck toothed, pale and athletically inept Dynamite, just looking at him doing nothing will begin the giggles! Along with Aaron Ruell and Jon Gries you can't ask for a better comedic team to marvel at. Gries gets the gist of the cool nerd down, spending most of his time trying to be attractive but falling far short while Ruell is at an even tie with Heder for who plays the perfect outcast. Under all the humor of course lies the dark life of someone who doesn't ""fit-in"" and in a casual way the filmmakers divulge this side of life without making it so harsh as to make a definite statement, although the point is made within the blast that is Napoleon. Make sure to stay until the credits are run for a short hint about the outcome of all the character's lives. This movie is simply a blast!"	5.0	Explode With Laughter!!	2005-08-29	6	5	1

I was one of them. Smart and funny, but not accepted, with few friends. Those who hate the movie, or don't find it funny, I wonder what group they belonged to, because I found myself laughing so hard that I remembered what it was like to be in high school, and how mind numbingly cruel the in-crowd can be. The pinata scene is hilarious for one reason, if the beautiful Ms. Wheatley had done it, nothing would have happened to her. Uncle Rico is is a riot with his football and minivan longing for days when he could have been somebody.The music, the time machine, even the tupperware...No wonder people don't get the point. No special effects, no over the top moments, no moral pontification. Just Napoleon doing what I wish I had when I ran for Class President...Dance my butt off to a rockin song, and have people cheer you - because you took a stand and stayed true to who you were.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2CDMCG1Z84A51	Wanda B. Red	*Napoleon Dynamite* gives the impression of plotlessness. Don't be fooled. The languid spiritlessness of the acting is a trick -- a kind of brilliant filmic *trompe l'oeils*. Underneath it all, the movie has the tremendous energy suggested by its title character's name.Even on a kind of literal level, really a lot is happening on screen: Young Napoleon's grandma breaks her coccyx, leaving Napoleon and his dysfunctional older brother Kip under the care of their even more dysfunctional Uncle Rico, who is so desperate to re-enact (with a different ending) an ill-fated football match from his own high school days that he purchases a time machine over the internet. Napoleon makes a new friend at school (the remarkably charming Pedro, played by Efren Ramirez), whose plans to run for school president are disrupted by a hot flash that causes him to shave his head.That's just the beginning, but it serves to make the point. The pace of the movie never flags, which increases the pleasure of watching it. While the time machine, of course (and quite amusingly), fails to work, the movie does instruct us in the possibilities of happy endings. And that's all I'm going to say about that.But the real pleasure, of course, comes from the hilarious disconnect between the affect of the actors and the situations in which they find themselves. Visually, the sense of disassociation is an aspect of the relentlessly ordinary and dry landscape and architecture; scenes are short and sometimes purposely confusing until later explanations emerge. Overall, the film's disciplined disengagement both accurately portrays the painful discomfort of adolescence, sweetly represented here as a period of tremendous latency. It also reflects a more profound reality that afflicts all of us. Mundane reality can give the most sophisticated and world-weary human the sense that all of life is just high school over and over again. ND gets at that insight.As a result -- and this is most important --because the film so adroitly manipulates the distance between experience and response, it is also very funny. I saw this film on my DVD player, but I've heard that the original audiences in the theaters were in stitches.And the dance scenes, managed with weirdly compelling elegance by Jon Heder, are also worth the price of admission. Again, they demonstrate that grace is the cousin of the grotesque, and that both are part of the human condition.	4.0	Tots in the Pocket	2006-04-02	12	11	1

The plot is non-existent, the characters are cartoonish clich&eacute;s and the production looks like it was thrown together during a weekend.  But with that said, I must say I enjoyed ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and have found myself laughing with friends over some of the more memorable scenes for the last several days.  The film is like that annoying hangnail that won't go away.  You can't stop playing with it, even though it bleeds when you tug at it.Napoleon Dynamite's title character exists in all high schools across the country.  He lives in his own world of mythological drawings and ninja gear.  His reality grows from a healthy imagination and a way of coping with the daily attacks from the ""cool kids"" and his inescapable existence on the outside of social circles.  The portrayal of a social outcast is so genuine, it at times becomes uncomfortable to watch, as viewers will see how easily a character like Napoleon could end up becoming a Columbine-like killer.A bold choice by writer/director Jared Hess is to refrain from making Napoleon into a hero.  Most often compared to characters in ""Revenge of the Nerds"", Napoleon isn't given a triumphant conclusion where the school realizes he was cool all along.  The film lacks sentimentality in this respect and appears to be the product of individuals who have experienced alienation first hand.The emphasis placed on a realistic portrayal of a ""loser"" also helps build most of the humor in the film.  Napoleon is so consistently bizarre and socially inept that viewers can't help laughing at him (even though we all want him to succeed).  From the first moment when Napoleon opens his ""Trapper Keeper"" and performs an experiment on an action figure, audiences will find him as irresistible as that hangnail that just won't go away."	4.0	Like an annoying hangnail that you like to play with	2005-01-08	8	7	1

I mean I totally loved last year's Pieces of April, because the story and the cast touched me a great deal. So with this movie, I found it to be quite enjoyable, because the characters are well written, and the jokes worked. It's a movie that I can relate to, because I have been in Pedro and Napolean's shoes in high school as a outcast.Napolean is a wierd and corky on the outside, but he's very sweet and kind on the inside. Nobody wants to be his friend, and he eventually became Pedro's(a Mexican immigrant) best friend, and he helped him run for President in school! A lot of funny things happen in the process of the campaign, and it was great when Napolean does his skit on stage. He danced with a Michael Jackson style to a song that stole the audiences' hearts and votes.Napolean eventually falls in love with the sweet girl in school, and Pedro won the election. His friend found his soul mate named La Sofauwnduh, a sexy and sultry Black girl. His pathetic uncle who sells breast enhancement products also found the love of his life. So in the end, everyone is happy.This movie is made to look like a home video, but it's  very good for a indie-film. And if you liked Ghost World(Thora Birch and Scarlette Johanson), you'll definitely love Napolean Dynamite(Jon Heder)!	4.0	He ain't your typical boy-next-door.	2004-12-22	2	1	1

""This film is artsy/cool and if I laugh at it then I WILL BE ARSTY/COOL!!! AND EVERYONE IN RETURN WILL THINK THAT I AM AWESOME!!"" People keep telling me ""Oh well some people just don't understand it and the others completely 'get it'"". News flash: There is nothing to get. And if I am a part of the group that 'doesn't get it' then God bless us all because we actually have a brain. Jesus. Please go rent a genuine comedy and prevent yourselves from torture."	1.0	i will never understand it....	2005-06-23	18	7	11

But if you just let it be what it is, you will enjoy it.  There are a couple of peaks in the ""non-action"" that I think are just riotious fun--and not because I feel ""superior"" to Napoleon.  A nice change to movies as usual in my opinion."	5.0	Quirky but let it do its thing	2005-01-31	3	3	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1I67DTCROOS25	Writer	"I have absolutely no idea how to properly describe this movie. I just know that I had to buy it b/c I rented it so often.Napolean is such a loser. His brother Kip could have a huge ""L"" on his own forehead.They have a pet llama named Tina and feed her casserole. Both young men live with Grandma, who broke her pelvis riding a 4-wheeler. So, Uncle Ricco moves in with the boys. He turns out to irritate Napolean and go in business with Kip.In the end, they all win, despite being awkward outcasts. Kip is especially transformed and finds love with a surprising woman.The quotes taken from this film are numerous! If for no other reason, rent or buy this movie to watch Napolean dance. There is a lengthy scene of his disco moves. Smooooth.And as Kip told a poor girl ""friend"" of Napolean's when she said she was selling homemade keychains to get herself through college, ""Your mom goes to college..."" Kip thought that was SUCH a good come back. I, as the viewer, felt sorry for his nerdy, ill-dressed character.* Especially like Napolean's friend, Pedro. Who shaves his head b/c he was hot - then buys a wig to cover his bald head. Why would have his head b/c he is hot? Isn't a wig hotter? *These are the questions raised by the film. It makes no difference in the world, but the film is quite entertaining."	5.0	SUCH a lovable, sad character	2006-10-28	2	1	1

Not expecting much from inflight movies, I wondered what I had stumbled onto. Within moments I was cracking up with laughter, thinking "" you gotta be kidding "". A passenger seated next to me (who appeared to be quite conservative) also started to let out spontaneous fits of laughter. So there we were snug in cattle class seats with headphones on wiping  consious tears from our faces and trying to stop ourselves from breaking into uncontollable asylum entrance laughter."	5.0	Flying High	2005-03-08	6	6	0

There were a couple of scenes that made me crack a smile and chuckle a bit, and I did like the dance scene at the end and the way the movie ended was good, but otherwise, I basically sat there straight-faced the entire movie, constantly glancing at the ""time-elapsed"" clock on my dvd player, counting down the time that was left in the movie because I couldn't wait to get done watching it and take it back to the video store.  This movie is just boring, plotless, and isn't very funny at all, save a couple small laughs here and there.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A2BGL9PLOAKCI1	Y. Khuja	When I first saw the previews for this movie I was not interested in seeing it at all. My friend, however, saw it in the theatres and insisted it was hilarious and made me and a few of my other friends go see it. She was cracking up the entire time, while the 4 of us were sitting there slightly chuckling once in a while, but mainly glaring at her for making us waste an hour and a half of our time and the money for the ticket. After we saw it though, we started randomly quoting the movie to the point where we did it so much that we wanted to see it again. The second time around it was definitely a lot more funny. I guess this is the kind of movie that slowly grows on you if you don't love it at first. Now all of us love the movie, have a copy of it, and still quote it. It's flippin sweet!	4.0	"Give it a chance, it's ""pretty nice"""	2004-12-25	4	3	1
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1P7ZOOEK9G9TG	yuanj1	I was laughing althroughout this movie, yet althroughout the whole movie, I was still asking myself: How could I be laughing at this (...)?Yes, this is a very pointless movie, but it's got my vote for one of the best comedies of 2004.  Unlike other movies, the actors in here don't try to be funny; they naturally are.Napoleon is a geek who gets slammed into lockers constantly, and who is a big fan of tetherball.  Along comes a newbie; Pedro Sanchez, who is also not so bright.  Alongside them, is a girl named Deb, who drinks 2% milk.  They make a team, and the movie shows you their adventures of Deb trying to be a photographer, Pedro trying to run for president, and Napoleon trying to dance.On the other side, you have Napoleon's uncle who comes to visit, and Napoleon's brother, who meets a pretty black girl named LaFonDuh.The movie travels constantly from the stories about Napoleon and his friends, to his brother and uncle.  Watch this movie and you'll be laughing constantly.P.S. Try not to stare at Napoleon's teeth; I almost threw-up doing it...	4.0	Strangely Amusing	2005-02-19	1	1	0
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A21VSFR7OG900O	"Zachary Hopper ""lynyrdskynhead"""	"I watched this movie because all of my friends said, ""you just have to see Napoleon Dynamite"". So I caved in and watched with a few of my friends. I have to say that this movie didn't even come close to living up to my expectations. In my opinion there were maybe one or two funny bits in the movie, but that's it. And the part that I hated the most was that if you took the scenes that actually had something to do with the plot, this movie would have been about 15 minutes long. The main character was genuinely unlikable and painful to watch. If I had to see this movie again I would probably drop alot of acid first, then I might be able to enjoy it.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"To be completely blunt, ""Napolean Dynamite"" is a terrible film when being evaluated by traditional movie standards.  It has no plot, the pacing is slow, the characters are stranger than strange, and there is absolute ZERO point to the overall experience.  That being said, it's one of those ""funny because it is stupid"" type of movies, and should be watched if only to understand why EVERYONE in 2004 was wearing ""Vote for Pedro"" t-shirts.For a basic plot summary...oh, wait...!  Basically, this movie follows the utterly random exploits of Napolean (Jon Heder), Kip (Aaron Ruell), Pedro (Efran Ramirez), Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), & Deb (Tina Majorino).  There really is nothing else to say.Like I said, I don't see how anyone can sit down and watch this movie and really, really like it.  It's just too pointless and stupid for that type of viewing.  Instead, you'll just find yourself chuckling at that very stupidity (which can only go so far, of course, but does produce a number of quote-worthy and memorable cinematic moments).In terms of the ""big picture"", I don't quite understand why ""Napolean Dynamite"" has become such a cult phenomenon.  I can see why it may appeal to junior-high clientele (what with its juvenile humor and loner/nerd characters), but other than that it just doesn't work on a higher level.I think, in the end, this movie is a rare example of a really bad movie catching lightning in a bottle for some ephemeral reason, becoming a cult classic along the way.

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"I would not recommend this movie to anyone! This was the most boring movie I have ever seen.The plot: An outsider meets the new kid at school and decides to help him run for class president.All of my friends at school talked about how funny it was, so since it had such a excellent reputation, I decided to check it out.You wait for something to actually happen, but honestly, nothing ever does. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is terrible. Only watch this movie if you have a couple of hours that you want to waste, and can't think of anything else that would be more entertaining such as this.This is a movie that has always sucked, not before every american teenager decided to quote it, or after everyone knew where the line ""GIMME SOME OF YOUR TATER TOTS!!!!!!"" originated from. Not because it has been over-quoted big-time, but because it has no plot or interesting dialogue whatsoever. The movie has no point, except maybe to top Pulp Fiction in being the most misquoted movie ever. The difference is, Pulp Fiction doesn't suck.For some reason, all of the 'goth' and 'emo' kids like this movie and idolize it. Not because they thought it was funny, but because their friend thought it was funny.I'd like someone to explain to me what the hell is so funny about some kid who talks like he's someone's bi*ch? And even if it were funny, why would it be funny when you say it? Well, its not. Almost every review on here that is for Napoleon Dynamite includes the words ""frickin'"" ""gosh"", or ""sweet!"". I would rather be blasted in the face with a shotgun loaded with Al Gore's semen than listen to another one of these horrible renditions of this shi*ty movie.Oh look, the guy needs chapstick! Call everyone! This movie needs to be seen over and over and over!Why don't you obsessed fans just break down and stalk the mediocre actor who played Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder is his name!) so you can ask him to do the lines over and over for you so you don't have to blather it off to everyone you meet?Seriously, this sh*t needs to end. I'm so sick of this movie. Shi*ty only half describes it. Take sh*t, add a baboon's ass, and multiply by Michael Moore's weight, and the product is Napoleon Dynamite.Kid1: Hey! Guess what I got? The Napoleon Dynamite DVD with 12 hours of extra footage of him saying ""IDIOT!""!!!Kid2: GOSH!! THAT IS LIKE THE BEST MOVIE EVER! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!Kid1: ""Your mom went to the college."" (Do you think I'm funny now?)Kid2: ""YES OMGZ GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH I LOVE THAT MOVIE""Kid1: ""AWESOME. RAD. LETS ANNOY EVERYONE ELSE WITH OUR LAME OBSESSION""Kid2: ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA! GOSH!""You will not be entertained. You will not be uplifted. You will not be engaged in the storyline as it does not have one. You will not be inspired. People will tell you that it has a bunch of great quotes. It doesn't. The quotes aren't great, they're just easy to remember, so anyone can pick up on them and recognize them when they come out of someone's mouth. ""Maybe I will! Gosh!""

B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A1GWOHXBS2D8D9	Zarithar	"This is more of a nitpick than anything. I've seen a number of people saying that this movie was set in the 80s. It wasn't, so therefore I find nothing credible about the reviews written by these people (who obviously weren't paying attention). For one thing, the internet as we know it now did not exist in the 80s... for another Uncle Rico would have been in his early 20s rather than mid to late 30s...Ah well, I guess the people who have this misperception hated it so much that they failed to pay attention. The setting for the movie is in fact a contemporary one set in small town America... and folks from larger cities may indeed feel that they've stepped back into the 80s visiting some of these towns.Enough about that... I liked the movie. No, it's not the ""best movie ever"" or even my favorite comedy, but it wasn't as bad as some are saying either."	4.0	This movie was NOT set in the 1980's	2005-09-14	5	3	2
B00005JNBQ	Napoleon Dynamite	A3SI83LHXQCVS2	Zen Station	"Like others have mentioned this is a movie you will either love or hate. In fact, everyone I know in person has an opinion to those extremes. I find myself in the former, because this movie is easily summed up in one word: Random. Yes, random... I wonder how it was thought up but I find it rather brilliant. So what if MTV Films was a part of this, it's a great movie. I even find people hating this movie quoting it, which is something that is pretty interesting.If you're looking for a meaningful movie though, you'll be dissapointed. There is like no real point to the movie, although I find that to be part of what's so great. The title character doesn't reveal it, but he's quite skillful: Good artist, dancer, and used it as part of the support to vote for Pedro, someone he had met from his school when he had first came to the school. A part of this movie involved with Napoleon & Pedro is in my title of this review.He lives with two people: his computer-loving cousin who is almost thirty and his total jerk uncle. The former character falls in love with a woman, Lafawnda, and the latter tried giving friend Deb some shampoo, which dissapoints her, although they do end up doing a dance together for the prom.He busts his moves more than anything for the class president thing, which resulted in Pedro's victory. It is part of what's really cool, I thought, along with a speech saying that ""all of your wildest dreams will come true"". I mean, who wouldn't vote for that.The greatest thing though about this movie is that it's like a home-made video in many ways, although the whole thing is completely acted. This low-budgetness kind of makes it the great movie it is as it has little to do with its visuals but with its storyline/plot. It is worth seeing multiple times."	5.0	"""Can I have your tots?"""	2005-05-25	6	4	2
