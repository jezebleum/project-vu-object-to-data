0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A199545U14YERT	"#1 Kiss Army Soldier ""Ramiro"""	I saw this movie on the premier, I was on first row, on the center that afternoon with my mom and dad. When it started everybody just shut up. It got interesting from the begining when Jesus starts praying in the garden and Judas betrays him. In the parts where I almost cover my eyes where on the part of the whips and chains and those things. The part where he carries the cross was one of the saddest things for me.Now we'll talk about the performances. The best performance in the movie was Caviezel's. He was the best Christ I've ever seen in movies. He looked so much like the Jesus. I think the best actor who played Christ. Then there is Mary, Jesus's mother. Did you know that the actress who played the Virgin Mary is Juish ? Her expressions were very well done. Her sadness was  incomparable. She is one of the best actress I've seen to this day. Then there is Satan. I do not know who the hell (haha) plays Satan, but she/he (I think it's a SHE) plays the part very...coldly, very...frightening. Good performance too.The movie itself was TOOOOOO violent. It's the same story, but the last twelve hours of Christ, but expressed in a very explict graphic and violent scenes. I bet you know more than two people died of watching Jesus being beat up with whips and chains and weapons. I didn't enjoy that at all. The performances were uncomparable. This movie is the most famouis R-rated movie of all times, I think you do not know that, but there are always some exceptions. It is one of the movies that you feel like you don't wanna see twice.There was also tons of strange stuff that happened during the making of the movie, I think most of you know, but for those who do not know I'll mention some of them below.When James Caviezel was crucified, I lightning stroke on his right shoulder. They had to stop the filming until he had to get better. Then, on the scenes in which he carries the cross he dislocates his shoulder (I don't remember which one it was) and they had to stop the filming for another three to six weeks. Then there was the part in the movie where Jim is taken to see some guy who looked weird that had make-up and a wig (I do not remember who that was) and when that guy spoke his lines from the script, he said other strange stuff he didn't wanna say and he had no control of it. Freaky, I know. At the part of the whipping, Jim Caviezel obviously pretended to be taken the hits, except three or four, some of those times when Caviezel was being hit with whips, they really hit him in the back a couple of times. In an interview, Caviezel explained that and he said he felt what Jesus himself felt when he was being punished. There were much more strange things that happened but I think if you buy this WIDESCREEN or FULLSCRENE edition DVD, I think if you access the SPECIAL FEATURES menu, then there should be some intervies in which Caviezel explains everythink.Buy this DVD or the FULLSCREEN formate. There are no different except on the screen, obviously. I am not that kind of a person in which likes to watch Jesus getting punished. It's sad.	5.0	Mel and Jim are just fantastic !!!	2005-01-20	8	5	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3NPR05DRQGHU4	2bhappyinlove	This movie gives the most accurate portrayal of what really happened to Jesus.  Other movies make it much gentler.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"There's one thing about ""The Passion of Christ"" that highlights its authenticity:  No one remains neutral after seeing it.  Most of the work seeks the genuine passion; some of it is interpretational; but all of it is intensely passionate.  Mel Gibson didn't simply recreate the scenes well and give history its native tongue, he also presented intensity and humanness in a very real way.  If we are to believe that there was a God-man who died a cruel death on all of our behalf, then that Emmanuel was made human and divine by Jim Caveziel, better than any other actor.  We can make all we can out of our past and ""the good old days"" when America seemed more like Christendom, but theatre goers of old would not accept this suffering Jesus, so at least in our post-Christendom time, we at least accept ""The Passion"" well enough from several sectors to be able to embrace the whole package.  As a spiritual event, ""The Passion of Christ"" is unvarnished, broadening our horizons of appreciation and compunction.  As history or entertainment, it may be merely a fascinating reinactment of a horrific death penalty for a major philosophical and charismatic leader.Specifically, the focus and intensity of Judas's betrayal, Christ's Passion in the Garden, and his arrest are done with dramatic, slow-motion timing.  The extent of Jesus's suffering has been commented on truly enough, but the ordeal is certainly brought in long and vivid detail.  There is certainly a perfectionism in Gibson's rendering of each torturous moment.  If we doubt the divineness presented, then how about the love and forgiveness presented under torturous circumstances ""Look, mother, I make all things new!""  Then, if there's incredulousness about the human traits, see similarly, the flashbacks of memory to a playful time with his mother or Caveziel shaking and looking with dread as they save their worst whips for last during the scourging.  The presentation of the devil and Judas's anguish after his betrayal are fine interpretive moments.  If you think the text is too harsh on the Pharisees, then just read the Bible.  If you think that Pontius Pilate isn't the political weasel presented or the Roman soldiers were too rough, then think again.""The Passion of Christ"" is a courageous and authentic reinactment of the Passion and Death of Christ.  For the two-plus hours we go through this confrontation, we are relieved by some beautiful and necessary flashbacks that are well highlighted.  It is an awesome film."	5.0	"""It Is as It Was!""

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3ELDRIQJ3CC7A	"Aaron E. Munn ""magnulus"""	"This is a good film all in all, and I've not seen it before till this year.  I had heard bad things about it, that it was intenitonally anti-Semitic or that it was nothing more than a bloody Jesus snuff film, but I dediceded to watch this film just to be fair.It is definitely views the Crucifiction from a more Catholic viewpoint, complete with extra-biblical imagery (crows eating the eye of a thief after he mocks Jesus, Mary Magdalene being equated with the sinful woman that Jesus rescues from stoning, which may or may not be nothing more than medieval stories).Unlike alot of other movies depicting the Crucifiction, the imagery used here is horrific and shocking, but never gratuitous as in a slasher film.  The banality of evil is not glossed over, just as in Gibson's other film Apocalypto.  The evil is not redeemed not by cheap moralism, but by Jesus character as a figure that actually believed in what he said, in his life and in his death.  Gibson's cleverly interposes pictures of Jesus teachings in with scenes of the crucifiction.  A cut to less bloody times with birds chirping on a sunny, grassy hill, and Jesus preaching the Sermon on the Mount, with his teaching to love your enemies, is juxtaposed with Jesus bloody and dying, and praying to God to forgive his executioners because of their ignorance: the teaching has been fulfilled.Also, I can somewhat understand the appeal of Maran devotion.  Throughout the film, Mary's story is weaved with the story of Jesus to reveal the early Christian community participating in the life of Jesus and his suffering, not something in an isolated manner that they sit back and watch.  After Peter's denial, he has a mental breakdown, the women-disciples try to comfort him. It is a deeply human appreciation that I don't think alot of Protestants would initially understand, the ""Communion of Saints"" is more than a sunday-morning soundbite in a creed.My only critique is that it portrays Pontius Pilate as being a rather sympathetic character- at most he is a moral coward faced with two difficult choices.  Honestly the biblical accounts dont' give alot of evidence either way, although historically Pontius Pilate wasn't know for being very humane.  On the other hand, it doesn't gloss over the cruelty of the Romans.  The Romans are portrayed as mostly savage thugs, with a few sympathetic characters.  Likewise, not every Jew in the Sanhedrin is portrayed as being hopelessly wicked, although they are generally portrayed as pompous religious fanatics.  King Herod is portrayed as being a demented man-child, which seems to be accurate to the biblical account as well."	4.0	not what I expected	2008-10-14	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2GOAEF0ZRNG13	Aaron	If I could rate this zero stars I would. A totally perverted view of the Story of Christ. A base film that totally panders to a bloodthirsty audience with short attention spans.  It's no wonder it was a hit. It offers nothing of the teachings of Christ to a novice. If you want to see a moving well made version of this story, seek out Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AK0UMLJ1LM5WO	Abby	"The Passion of the Christ is  a Pointless movie... all it does is depict a lot of unnecassary suffering. If Jesus thought he was alleviating us of a burden then he was wrong, we all have to suffer. The pain he went through is best seen (to me anyways) as symbolic, a physical representation of the spiritual suffering we all must go through in order to arrive at the truth within ourselves...""To truly find God, truth needs to be found independently from the opinions of others. The truth has to be found in our hearts."" --A.H.AlmaasIf you're trying to find some nugget of truth within this movie... I would say it is that sometimes, as Jesus has done, we must go against the majority, even if it means suffering. Right now the majority happens to be hypocritical bible thumpers. Christianity has become a raging cult, Jesus would be agonizingly disappointed in. I urge anyone who reads this to please, for your own sake, think independently of others.Oh, and one more thing. Don't bring your children to this movie unless you want them to be traumatized. Just remember, therapy is expensive these days....."	2.0	Jesus would be disappointed in you all...	2004-09-02	38	13	25

Movie?Language is in Aramaic and the way they speak it is not believable (it's like saying 1 word at a time and stopping for 2 seconds between each word). They should have practiced more to make the dialog flow smoother. The whole movie is about his last moments, so don't expect much on character development.

The scariest part is that, with his status as a celebrity, Gibson has the ability to turn the nation into so many anti-semites.  He is setting a negative example for Americans and for the international community as well.  Just think - [...] only had the ability and resources to influence the opinions of the citizens of one country ... and he was responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews.  Gibson's influence is far wider.	1.0	I'd give it a negative number of stars if I could!	2004-12-04	34	9	25
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ZW2B564017OS	A. Christian	This film is probably the first accurate depicture of what Christ went through.  I don't recall anyone producing a more accurate version of historical fact.  Over the years, scientists have worked to disprove the idea that Christ suffered for everyone's sins, that Noah built an arc, that the ten commandments actually existed.  But as the years have gone by, scientists are finally starting to locate the very artifacts that were discussed in the Bible.  Not to mention that the very cities and locations depicted in the Bible are not only real but you can travel to them and visit them today.  Anyone who says they don't believe that any of this is real is denying themselves the right to believe in historical fact that is backed by evidence, not only written testimony but also archeological findings.  I am extremely happy that Gibson put together this film, because in a society that is overrun by drugs, abuse, sex, etc., we need to bring back the very foundation that everything was founded upon.  We need to remind everyone that this is real, yes it exists, and if you feel guilty about it then ask yourself why.  Everyone should see this film.  That's all there is to it.  However, it could be too graphic for very young kids.	5.0	Accurate, Detailed, and Shocking	2004-09-01	13	5	8

Of course Jesus spoke to Mel Gibson and gave his script writers enough material to fill a long movie.  Hmmm.  My Bible certainly doesn't have all those details.  But I'm NOT Mel Gibson!  I can't sucker hoards of people to worship at the alter of the big screen.  Did you ever ask yourself the question, ""What would Jesus do if he saw this?""  Good question, since he was there and Mel Gibson wasn't.  For those of us who really are devoted to Jesus and READ THE BIBLE, this movie is an atrocity.  Oh well, go out and buy the DVD if you think it represents our Lord.  And while you're at it, buy the ""Passion Stationary Kit"" too.  It's being sold at Walmart.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2V8OVZV3NKXLR	A Customer	Though 'The Passion of the Christ' is not an easy film to watch, I would still rate it as one of my top films of all times. This is an eye-opener, one of the most realistic portrayals to the life of Christ. Though very violent, this is what really happened (if not exactly like the actual event, at least close to it), and therefore something we must be aware of, rather than having the facts sugar-coated.Additionally, Gibson put in greater depths to Christ's suffering by having flashbacks to Palm Sunday as well as his childhood, and this just made me weep all the more. If you haven't seen the movie, you must watch it to see how these events fit into the context of the last 12 hours.A haunting and powerful film, it made me weep up to the very end. I recently saw this again at a church viewing, and the entire church hall was filled with sniffing and weeping. Some people were even prepared with a huge box of tissues. It's a movie that has stayed with me for the rest of my life.	5.0	A haunting, powerful film	2010-11-25	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	The acting was fine, but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown, covered with blood, hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone, Jesus Christ or anybody else, taking such an ass kicking. What was it, 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here, Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh, there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds, sunlight through a hole in his hand, Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday.	1.0	The Passion of Mel Gibson	2006-08-28	15	6	9
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A35TKJ196QZIVO	Adam	"To start off with, I actually have an early release of the dvd, so my stars are based on that, not the cinema.I made it through about six or seven pages on reviews before I decided to write this and from what I see, three subjects usually appear as the reason for bad reviews.The first reason is it is too violent.  We all knew this, before we even went to see it.  It was all over news, media, etc.  We were warned not to take our kids, be prepared for violence, not for the weak of heart.  So, if you went expecting scenes of the beach, then that is your own fault.  I didn't watch it hoping to see a blood bath, but I knew it was coming.I am a very faithful Protestant, and I do see some Catholic overtones in the story, but that is Mel's interpretation and overall I felt it was pretty accurate.  It is interesting to me that all of these people that may or may not have a personal relationship with Jesus, seem to know that if he were here today, he would not support this film.The second reason people complain is because it doesn't tell the full story of Jesus.  It isn't supposed to.  It is the Passion of the Christ, and passion means suffering.  It isn't the story of the Christ or the Gospel of the Christ.  It is basically a Passion play put to cinema.  He isn't trying to show us the teachings of Jesus, he is showing us the suffering of Jesus.  He is showing us what He went through for us.  If you see this movie and aren't moved by the sacrifice that He made for all of us to be free, then you don't get it.  And if you don't understand and you don't get it, then that is ok, I pray someday that you will.The third thing I pick up on in these reviews is that Mel is using it just for profit.  He has made money at ever other movie he has made I am sure, and yet no one ever questions his motives then.  Yet, when he comes out with something of a religious nature when we are in a world that requires us to be politically correct, then he was just doing it for money.  He put up his own money and I personally hope he makes all the money he can off of it, not that he needs it.  So what if there is a director's cut later on?  How may different directors editions or box sets of Lord of the Rings are out there?  I get tired of having to apologize for what I believe.  If someone stands up for an important issue, whatever the hot topic of the week is, then that is their right to voice their opinion and they expect everyone to recieve it and agree.  But if I as a Christian stand up for what I believe, then I am a ""Jesus Freak"" or a ""Fanatic"".  So if you don't agree with me, that is your right, but if I don't believe what you do, then I am narrow minded??  What happened to my right to my own beliefs?While I am still on my soap box, it is amazing to me that people still think this film is anti-semitic.  If you have any knowledge of the history prior to this then you should know that Jews were a large part of this area, so who else would send Jesus to the cross?  He was Jewish, it was just the circumstances.  And if you don't know the history, then read the bible, don't blame Gibson.Back to the movie, I liked the dvd, thought it was a great movie.  I tip my hat to Mel Gibson for having the courage to put his money where his mouth is and put his beliefs to film.God Bless"	5.0	The Passion	2004-08-27	12	9	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3OGWBZV2F8M74	"Adam Rosenbaum ""Author of 'How to Remember No..."	"The Passion of the Christ is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. After reading up on the events of Jesus' last twelve hours as well as commentary from respected sources like Pope John Paul, I watched this film with an eye on the historical details as Mel Gibson presented them.It is true that the scenes involving the whippings and the crucifixion are extremely brutal and disturbing. But one of Gibson's purposes in making this movie was to demonstrate how Jesus suffered at the hands of the Roman guards. The newspaper critics who smugly wrote this off as if it were one more sadistic Hollywood bloodbath miss the point that anyone can produce a blood-gore-and-guts film, but very few can make it relevant in a historical perspective.Another interesting feature of The Passion is the fact that the majority of the dialogue is in Aramaic, and in the case of the Romans, Latin. I was surprised to recognize at the beginning of the film the words of one of the ""4 questions"" that we ask at the Jewish Passover meal called Seder: ""Why is this night different than all other nights?""If there is any criticism it is that from time-to-time Gibson transitions from one scene to the next almost too quickly, and it's not always easy to keep track of who's who or what they're doing. This aside, the scenery and acting are top-notch and the story is engaging even though you know the ending.One additional item I was curious about was the charge of anti-Semitism, especially regarding the representation of the role of the Hebrew priests in Pilate's decision to crucify Jesus. Personally I think this charge was a lot of nonsense coming from people who tend to run their mouths too much. The facts are that Jesus was challenging the corrupt temple hierarchy, and the Hebrew priests' motivations were largely political, e.g., getting rid of a potential threat. During the movie I really didn't see how anyone could interpret this differently, unless you were looking for a reason to do so.The Passion of the Christ is well worth watching and I strongly recommend it. But be prepared, because there's no doubt about the fact that some of the scenes are very rough."	5.0	One of the most intense movies I have ever seen	2005-08-15	11	8	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3IAP2JMTP5YBN	"adriana ""alisa"""	"Well, after hearing all the CRAZED controversy about this film,I felt a lot of anticipation about the movie. I expected a punch in the gut- a moving,wrenching film; in short, I expected to be blown away.Well, after seeing the movie, I was neither incredibly moved, nor blown away. I just experienced an assault of never-ending violence that wasn't all that graphic, and was just pretty pointless.I understand Gibson wanted to show the world what Jesus went through, what he sacrifcied. But having Jesus whipped with a spiked barbell for 127 minutes is not the way to go about it. I WANTED to be moved, I WANTED to feel Jesus's pain and be changed or whatever by seeing all that he experienced. But I wasn't; I felt like I was being attacked by Mel Gibson who probably thought that the best way to go about it was to show Christ getting beaten, stabbed,whipped for over two hours. Instead of feeling moved-I felt numb.A few things I did appreciate was the acting-which felt very natural and didn't go over the top. What I liked the most about ""Passion"" was the fact that Gibson chose to film the whole thing in Latin with subtitles.This definately was a huge plus to the film-and it made it feel a whole lot more authentic.I can't say how much I appreciated the people behind the film going that extra mile, because it definately paid off.Is the Passion of the Christ worth seeing? I'd say, no, not really. I can't say that its a complete waste, but it really builds no common ground with the viewer-and, really, the violence is nothing to talk about. True, there is A LOT of it, but it isn't particularly graphic -I just think that its impossible to build a film, no matter what the subject involving nothing but violence,violence, and violence.So,even if you're simply going in for curiosity, there's nothing here that's going to shock or surprise you.It's a well put together film-but for such an important theme it really provides nothing to think about.p.s.-I'm Jewish, and while I can see what people mean when they say that there was a slight anti-sematic element to the film, it was a lot more slight than I expected, and I personally was not offended.I'm not a history expert-I really don't know a thing about the Bible or history, so I'm not one to discuss the film's accuracy. On a second note, I think it's kind of pointless that a person would go in to see a movie expecting a history lesson. This is one guy's personal vision-not a documentary, or a historical novel, and I'd never go into a film expecring anything of the kind. And after seeing the film, I had to laugh a bit about all the hoopla and controversy surrounding it. There's really nothing controversial about this movie(save the fact that it's about Jesus), and if the man behind the whole thing wasn't blockbuster king Mel Gibson, I doubt that anyone would've said a word about it.Overhyped, overblown- and not really a point to it.It's well put together, well acted, and for that, I give it some credit.But, that is simply not enough."	2.0	2.5 stars	2004-06-12	10	2	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A28NIXW8PAJEYA	Adrian Heathcote	I don't have any problem with Jesus being played by Jim Caveziel---those who think that they know what Jesus looked like (light-skinned or dark) are simply indulging in fantasy: no one knows how a Galilean of that period would have appeared. I don't have any problem with someone wanting to tell some version of the Gospel stories with a measure of cultural accuracy: that is an interesting idea, and perhaps timely. I have no problem with the writer adding mythological elements of his own: that is to be expected, and anyway it is in accord with biblical mythology. I see no merit in the claims of anti-Semitism: only the leader of the Sanhedrin is really blamed for Jesus' condemnation, and it is clear that others disagree. There is no uniform antipathy directed towards the Jews in this film.And yet I find this film one of the most despicable exercises in sadism that I have ever witnessed. There is not a shred of genuine religious feeling here, just a terrible desire to turn the gospels into a fantasy of cruelty beyond anything that is actually written. Yes, the Romans were capable of great barbarism, but what we see here is beyond all belief. (Strange that no Italians have risen up in protest: they have far more cause to complain than those who are Jewish.) This film is not a testament to a Christian faith, it is a testament to a sickness of soul that, by the tone of many of these laudatory reviews, is now horribly shared. And finally, those who took children to see this film, knowing what it is like, lacked judgment to a degree that I cannot fathom. What were you thinking? I hope it was worth all the nightmares.	1.0	Appalling Travesty	2005-04-18	69	35	34
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A29LE9CQTX8IIN	adrian l mccartney	This is the first movie that I will admit I spent at least half of it crying.  I have studied the early chistian church for several years and have my own opinions about the early church.  But here is a movie that unlike most of the stuff that Hollywood makes these days, shows that one person in hollywood shares the majority of America's views on Christianity and did his very best to give us a example of what Jesus of Nazareth went through.  For those people that argue that this movie is overly violent, I would suggest you travel to any third world country and take a serious look around. America as a whole is really sheltered from most of the cruelties that someone from those countries accept as a matter of life.  And for those who shout Anti-Semitism, I saw None.  You generally go through life seeing what you're looking for at the time.  What I saw was an entrenched, established power clique of people trying to hold on to their power by any means necessary.  This is an election year, don't tell me that you won't see the same type of thing on the news for the rest of the year, from both parties. The Romans weren't exactly covered in glory either, but it was an accurate portrayal of them as a culture. I will say this at the end, I will be very surprised if he doesn't get at least one Oscar for this movie, But He didn't do it for an Oscar, which is surprising for Hollywood.  I'll buy this Movie when it comes out on DVD and watch it at least once a year.	5.0	"Awesome movie, Inspiring, a ""Buy me"" DVD Movie!!!!"	2004-02-27	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat, critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular, I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor, hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama.	4.0	Powerful.	2008-08-13	3	2	1

This is the most important event in human history portrayed on film, in the most unapologetic, no holds barred fashion.You've read or you've heard what he did for us on the cross, but that is nothing compared to seeing it.  No one can truly know the depth of pain and suffering he went through to save us all, even after seeing this film.  The sick thing is we look in horror and some cant even bear to face it because its ""so horrible"" but guess what?  That should be us bearing that punishment.  The least we should do is be willing to face it.This film Mel Gibson has made goes right along side ""The Ten Commandments"" in what it means to me and my biblical film library.  It is a fine cut into main stream media that is completely unforgiving in its delivery of truth.  Some cant handle it.  Some can.  Some dont want to handle it...Funny thing is, I believe even the staunchest Atheist knows there is a God, they just chose to lie to themselves to make life easier for themselves with their decision.If you believe, and you face this truth, you have to decide what your going to do about it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"To start us out on the right foot, I thought that it was good, but definitely not great.  Mel Gibson is a powerful director that proves that he can handle big epics like Braveheart or very emotional stories like Passion of the Christ.  His creative eye and ability to transform a simple story into a very real and seismic journey is impressive.  There are not many directors that I feel could handle these two challenges together.  Gibson has proved that he could twice.  Throughout this film, I was constantly impressed with the visual images that were presented before me.  Everytime Jesus was hurt, I could feel the pain just oozing from the television.  The ability that Gibson has to bring us these hauntingly beautiful images and also control his actors into becoming their characters left my jaw on the ground.  He is a genuine director that was able to bring his personal passion to the screen with bold emotions and a powerful eye.As mentioned before, I felt that Gibson did a fantastic job and should have been recognized by the Academy for his ability in Passion, but the overall film seemed lacking. There I was, sitting on my couch deeply getting involved with the film, when suddenly it is over.  The last twenty minutes of this film just seemed like they were rush edited together.  I realize that it is only supposed to be an account of the final twelve hours of Christ, but I needed something sturdier to wrap the film up.  There just seemed to be so many loose ends.  Perhaps it had something to do with the random and chaotic flashback sequences that both aided and hurt the overall tone of the story.  The flashbacks were helpful in identifying the ""when"" and ""who"" of the story, but never really hit upon the ""why"".  Some flashbacks helped progress the story, while others just left me with a puzzled look on my face.  This was a negative aspect of the film.  I think the writers of this film should have just allowed the story to progress from the beginning.  Not necessarily taking up hours in building these moments, but a quick recap at the beginning would have helped the less religious person in me.  I just felt the ending and these brief snippets were distracting and not as informational as I wanted them to be (which is why they were there in the first place).Aside from that, the rest of this film was a sheer enjoyment to watch.  To see this man suffer for our sins was impressive and an act that you would not see today.  The actors in this film exceptionally portrayed the characters.  James Caviezel's emotion is unmatched in the film industry, while the nearly wordless actions of Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci added so much more to the story.  To see their eyes along could bring tears to any strong person.  The portrayal of Satan (or evil) was also impressive.  I didn't quite know how Gibson was going to incorporate this, but the method that he used provided this real image of evil instead of a ""cartoonish"" or ""CGI monster"" creation.  It kept the story balanced and provided some controversial themes for Christ as he carried the cross.  The reality of this film is what also impressed me.  Sometimes with adaptations you get these random tangents that feel like the director was just looking to pull more people into the theaters, but not with Passion.  Gibson's choice to use the language at the time was absurdly perfect.  I would have preferred to see this film without the subtitles, because it would have built a stronger emotion behind the events as they took place.  Since he did not do that, the choice to have it subtitled with still the original voice again kept this film grounded.True, this was a story about Jesus, but to me what was harder to watch was the violence that man has inside of him.  Here we have a truthful story showing man destroying man.  That to me is more frightening than all the blood on Jesus.  To watch another person do what they did to this person was simply horrific.  While others will argue that this never happened, I say to them, pick up a newspaper and read the headlines.  The actions that we do to our fellow man are just as bad as what these Romans did to Jesus.  While we may not see all the blood, our consistent lack of respect and rising murder rate prove that we care nothing for our neighbor.  This had me thinking that perhaps Gibson's true message had something to do with the status of our world today ... hum ... something to think about!Overall, I thought this was a good movie, just not the greatest I have seen.  Perhaps the excitement and publicity (good and bad) surrounding this film built it up too much, but I have seen better.  Sadly, I think the religious people in the world that speak negatively about this film need to realize that it was just a film.  There are worse movies being released today that perhaps they should be focusing their attention onto.  Gibson should have been nominated for an award for this film just because of the power that he created.  I also think that Caviezel and Morgenstern should have been rewarded for their work.  I have seen emotional films, but these two actors brought more to the table than I have seen in any other film.  It impressed me, and it should have impressed the Academy.  While I think everyone should see this film once, I do not believe it is one that should be continually recognized as one of the greats.  Gibson could have had the best film of the year, but loose ends and fragmented flashbacks caused this film to stay at average.Grade: *** out of *****"	3.0	Why is this night different from every other night?	2005-04-06	7	4	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A32QMCROHLYU08	"Air Mattress ""supersonicjellybean"""	I saw this movie only after it had stood in theatres for a few weeks, so that I would be allowed the views and opinions of friends and critics before seeing it myself. The controversy before its premier did set me somewhat on edge; however, as a Jew and as a student of religion I knew the story of the crusifixion of Christ long before Mel canned this film. It would have been rediculous to want Gibson to make Christ's death anything other than the result of the Jewish Pharasees, though the fault of Christ's death rests (theologically speaking) with all people, as it was for the sin of the world for which he died. I do think Gibson could have done a better job of getting that message across, but since this was a physically historical and not philosophical movie I think he did a good job of getting the facts straight.That asside, this was a very powerful and realistic movie, using all senses possible to give a real and accurate portrayal of historical events. Whether you're a Christian, Jew or other, there's no denying that the Romans killed a man named Jesus of Nazareth at the request of Jewish leaders, and that the methods used in the film were very like the methods used by the Romans of the time. For anyone interested in historical religion, this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 for accuracy alone.The Catholic elements are hard to ignore: the prevalence of focus on the two Marys, the people Jesus met on his way to Golgotha, the speculation on the Christ's childhood. Although not all historically accurate, they lend a taste of what the director wanted to leave with the audience: That Jesus was a real man, he had a real life, he knew real people and died a real death. Those things are known, the ressurection is taken on faith.All in all, although I never want to see this movie again, I give it five stars, and give Mr. Gibson a round of applause.	5.0	A Jew stands and cheers	2005-01-07	14	11	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ZGZ26FL35MVX	"A. J. Abalahin ""velikiy_inkvizitor"""	"Looking back, I find myself grateful for the details I personally found laughable or just plain odd - without them the experience might have been overwhelming.  I'll only give one example:  the Temple guards' uniforms reminded me of figures from _Battlefield Earth_.  There are camp elements here and there in this film, just as there are in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where they are ubiquitous - though without necessarily detracting from the overall beauty and power of that work.Let me get my main pedantic peeve out of the way first.  I loved the fact that the dialogue was largely in Aramaic.  It gave me the feeling that I was hearing for the first time something of what Jesus' voice must have sounded like.  Furthermore, I think it salutary that Americans who have been raised to imagine their God as speaking only the English of the King James Bible be exposed to hearing Jesus speak in sounds reminiscent of Hebrew and Arabic.  Another realistic touch I appreciated was how at one point Mary and Mary Magdalene break from Aramaic to quote Scripture in Hebrew.  The particular flavor imparted by these languages should continually remind the viewer that Jesus was after all a Jew.What I found glaringly missing was Greek.  A lot of the exchanges, particularly between Pilate and the High Priests, perhaps between Pilate and Jesus himself, would have been in that language.  There is one point where Jesus unexpectedly shifts into fluent Latin - not likely historically accurate but I think it serves as a hint at how Mel Gibson views Jesus, as a being possessed of extraordinary powers (though otherwise, of course, his utterly human vulnerability to pain is what Gibson stresses).The highest compliment I can pay this film is that it is very traditional.  Anyone acquainted with how Christ's Passion has been represented in Catholic art, figurative and dramatic, over the centuries, will recognize that Gibson's work flows directly out of that heritage of imagery, including the painstaking depiction of human brutality.Is the film anti-Semitic?  I would say as a whole it is not, though individual scenes taken in isolation could be labeled that - unlike Franco Zeffirelli in his _Jesus of Nazareth_, Gibson makes no moves to portray the Jewish religious authorities as reasonable or dignified.  But the sadistic Roman soldiers come off far worse, I think, and Pontius Pilate ends up looking pathetically weak (the historical Pontius Pilate may have been monster, but the reasonable but ultimately cowardly Pontius Pilate of tradition offers a far more meaningful proto-type of moral failing).  Gibson's intent is to argue that all humans as sinners are guilty for torturing and killing Jesus, inasmuch as he submitted to such a death in order to redeem humanity from its sins.  The preponderant weight of the film directs the viewer to that idea, not to the temptation to blame any particular race.I would still say I imagine Zeffirelli's _Jesus of Nazareth_ as more historically accurate, but that is not to say that it is better than Gibson's _Passion_, only that the two are different and that each is valuable in its own inimitable way.  Evil comes in many flavors.  It can be insipid, accomplished with bureaucratic coldness, with indifference or absentmindedly.  Or it can be pungent with every fervid sadism, as depicted by Gibson.  The historical Jesus could have died suffering either kind - most likely, and no different, for instance, from the victims of the Holocaust, he was killed by some mixture of both.  The Jesus of Christian belief died to redeem sin in all its modalities.One last element I would like to commend Gibson on is his depiction of the Devil.  It is clear that Gibson believes in the existence of the Devil and wants to stress the presence of the Devil in the drama of Jesus' suffering.  However, Gibson never shows the Devil as manipulating humans like mere zombies - the humans in the film do all their evil without the Devil prompting them, indeed we often forget that the Devil is even there, hovering and watching.  That is sound moral theology.I would not make any predictions that this film will ""convert"" anyone, but I would venture that Christians will understand their faith more deeply after watching this film.  Non-Christians as well will understand Christian faith more deeply, though they may be no more disposed to sharing that faith than beforehand.  There is even a lesson in it about purely human evil and purely human goodness that a fully secular person could derive from the movie. It is amazing how much violence we regularly consume in our entertainment without becoming any more sensitive to what evil is.  The Passion, at the very least, teaches us something about what we humans are capable of doing to each other."	5.0	Just a movie, not a perfect movie, but what a movie!	2004-02-26	4	4	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1LIS4BFMI6C4A	A. Jasper Rains	Though I beleive this film was a bit over-hyped I found it to be quite well done. It was beuatifully direceted and photographed. I was moved to tears on severeal occasions. However, I found that the scourging scene, which is the most violent by far, didn't move me to tears but rather brought me to a moment of silent, somber, hurt. I found tears were more prevelent in the simple moments of the movie. The simplicity of the story yet the eternal difference it makes to those who believe. I do not believe that this movie was nearly as violent on a whole as the hype would have us believe. It is amazing that the same Hollywood that produces gross out horror flicks would be calling this film to violent. Go figure.I didn't feel it was particularly anti-jewish on any level. Even in the mob scenes there were many people opposed to what was going on. Yes Ciaphas, the high priest, is definitely the bad guy, the result did not rest on the hands of all jews by the movie's interpretation.I do not recommend this movie to anyone under 9th grade. The theme is hard and the violence is a bit much for children. I do think this will become the premeir movie dealing with the crucifixion of Christ.Well done. Well made.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ELP13J2HSGJQ	AJ Denny	The Passion of the Christ is a film I doubt will ever be shown on television as an Easter Holidays Special. It interweaves high-level violence worse then you found in most horror films, the subtitling of two languages, and the brutal simplistic story of a medieval passion play. There is a single theme brought home again and again. Christ suffered for our sins.When Mel Gibson first planned making the film, he didn't want to use subtitles. Through most of the film, you don't need them anyway to understand what is taking place. There is a visual language in the stylised costumes, and the acting.Jesus Christ (James Caviezel) has a quiet distance from the world that shows without words he is the Son of God. Speaking, Caviezel detracts from this by delivering his lines with a wooden earnestness.The film occurs during the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus. It isn't easy to understand the story. Gibson may think his audience will have read the New Testament. Or he didn't want this story to detract from the violence, at the heart of the film.This violence begins when he is taken prisoner by the Jewish Temple Guards. To describe the violence he suffered here would be to detract from the graphic nature of it. Reading what happens to him, you won't be able to suspend your disbelief to believe he could have survived any of it.The scourging of Jesus is made worse by Gibson's attention to detail. The Romans have to work themselves up to be able to do it. The sound made by the torture instruments striking into Jesus' flesh. Even when Gibson shies away from the scourging, you can still hear it. This will probably become one of the most memorable, and horrifying, sequences in cinematic history.Between the scenes of Jesus' torment, we witness the other characters in the story. Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello) receives his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. But he, and his money are cursed. In scenes of graphic ugliness, he is driven to madness and suicide.The two Marys, Jesus' mother (Maia Morgenstern) and the former prostitute Mary Magdalene  (Monica Bellucci) are there to witness, and react to the suffering of Jesus. It is from them, we are meant to gauge how to feel about the events unfolding on the screen.These events are of suffering and pain. The actual crucifixion is almost a relief after the scourging. By then Jesus is a half dead, blood-splattered ruin of a man. He dies on the cross along side two common criminals. To keep the interest of his audience, here Gibson adds Hollywood touches you won't find in any bible.You also won't find any spirituality, or goodness here. The theme of this dark movie is the pain and suffering Jesus suffered on behalf of Christians. For them, it is a gorefest held in a good cause. It is this audience the film is intended for.	3.0	Mediveal Passion Play Brought to the Screen	2005-11-08	7	4	3

This movie is great, but the DVD is the same thing as you saw on the big screen, no interviews, no commentaries, no deleted scenes, just the trailers and that's it. I would love at least to hear Mel's opinion on such a controversial film, but the fact that this DVD is so pale without any extras makes me wonder if it Gibson is waiting to release another DVD (Special Edition, Collector's Edition, Blessed by the Pope Edition or whatever you want to call it). Is Mel trying to take more from us?Anyway the movie is great, and the controversy was all taken out of proportion, the movie is violent but the Turin's cloak and other studies have proven that Christ's death was violent. This movie will help the christian people to see and contemplate more on our Lord suffering for us.PS: This space is to make an opinion of the movie, not to make a theological rapport on Jesus and if it was really the Son of God or not.

That said, watching this film in some way managed to strike a chord within me which resonates even now.This is *not* easy viewing by any stretch of the imagination - the many reviews here should give you a clue of that. But what the film does - very successfully - is highlight the capacity of ordinary men to commit acts of almost pure evil when faced with the unknown. Claims of anti-Semitism against this film are - in my opinion - somewhat off the mark. Gibson places the blame for the torture, humiliation and execution of Jesus on the shoulders of all men. Jewish elders, Romans and Herod are all shown as lacking in courage and compassion.What Gibson has created is as stark and pure a story-telling of the Passion as we have seen in cinema.

Sometimes you need time to re-evaluate how you feel about seeing an emotional film like this, and I am changing my review due to the fact that I have seen many films since that I would place above this, and also due to the fact that the film did not stay with me as long as thought it would, what makes it less amazing than it once was to me. It is still a very good film, and a powerful one, but I also realize after thinking, that it really isn't that hard to make audiences feel emotional about the crucifixion of Jesus. I understand why it was such a phenomenom, but I don't wish to hail it as I once did, due to the fact that the film just isn't as amazing in  my  mind months later, unlike other films I have seen this year and loved. Mel Gibson and James Caviezel still did great jobs, and while I hope there are other people recognized before them at Oscar time, I would understand the sentiment.

I could write at least 1,000 words about this film, but will simply urge everyone (except children) to see it.It is very violent, but so is the earth we walk on, with its earthquakes and volcanos, and continual wars since the dawn of man. I think perhaps some people find this film more graphic than the usual senseless savagery that assaults the senses in today's films because of the meaning behind the scourging and crucifixion; it is very disturbing, and it should be. There is no anti-semitism, any more than there would be ""anti-romanism"". No one killed Jesus, He laid down his life. It also depicts extremely heroic and compassionate Jews, and priests who are angered by the arrest of Jesus and call it a travesty.The cast is superb, as well as other elements like cinematography, score, and art direction, but this is Gibson's masterpiece, a magnificent work that will touch millions of hearts that are ready to hear its message.The DVD release (which includes no ""extras"") is a rather dark transfer, at times not having the full range of color of the original. The good aspect of it is that one can see it as Mr. Gibson originally intended his film to be seen, with no subtitles."	5.0	one of the most important films ever made	2004-02-25	176	137	39
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A20LY8E9NGYA4M	Alejandro Cortes	Finally, Mel Gibson's controversial movie &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; arrives on DVD. The film has been the generator of an impressive publicity campaign: magazines, TV, newspapers, religious and non-religious comments, you name it. However, the most interesting thing about it is that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is not your typical Hollywood biography, this is not a crowd-pleaser, the film is a risky proposal and doesn't make concessions at all.Director Mel Gibson could have made a comfortable film, with well-known superstars such as himself in the lead roles, but the main criterion to chose the actors was that their physical appearance and acting style were suitable for the essence of each role. Basically, the cast is a bunch of little-known actors (at least when the movie was filmed): Jim Caviezel as Jesus, the gorgeous Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Rosalinda Celentano as Satan and Maia Morgenstern as Mary. Most of those names didn't say too much before the release of the movie, but their performances are solid and believable.In the technical aspect &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is EXCELLENT. The costumes, the makeup, the photography, the sets, the locations are amazing, you really get the sensation that you are a witness of the real events. The photography shows beautiful landscapes that made a big contrast with the tragic scenes in the movie, a very interesting combination. The music is atmospheric and the sound effects are very real.&quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; visually is one of the most powerful movies ever made because there are a lot of violent scenes, most of them are so real that you can almost feel the pain and the torture, definitely this is not a movie for little children, is a movie for mature audiences. By the way, there has been a lot of criticism for Mel Gibson because some people think that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is an anti-Semitic movie, that is, against the Jewish, but let's be objective here, the message is very clear and obvious, &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is a criticism against THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE, not against a specific community.&quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites everybody to reflect about our violent behavior, most of us are capable of using violent methods in order to get our own benefit. &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites us to reflect about our very own human nature. Definitely, Mel Gibson is a very, very interesting director, let's keep an eye on him, he might surprise us again, like he did with &quot;Braveheart&quot; and with &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot;.	4.0	A MOVIE THAT'LL GIVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME	2004-08-06	12	9	3

For those that saw it in the theater, you probably heard the silence at the end of the movie as everyone filed out.Why this movie instead of trash like Last Temptation? or JC Superstar?  Because it follows the book and shows what He went through for us.  Is it anti-semetic?  No more or less than the Bible.  Christ was a jew and the jews condemned him.  Oh, and were there the race riots that were predicted?  Of course not.This movie is in my collection and will serve as part of my family's Easter Tradition each Good Friday.	5.0	Christ have mercy on us	2005-01-17	17	10	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A34R3PM9KEWNZS	__Alessandro__	"I suspect that most Christians already owned a copy of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ."" In my case, I owned the widescreen edition.If you don't own a copy -- Stop reading right now, and buy this DVD!If you do own a copy, you're probably wondering what's new in this re-release.Mel Gibson's 2004 blockbuster is at the same time part documentary and part (very personal) artistic meditation of the Passion -- the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is perhaps one of the most moving films ever made and one of the most important films for evangelism in today's secularist Culture of Death.Three years after its release (which, like the Gospels themselves, was a source of heated debate and division), it has been re-released as a ""Definitive Edition,"" with a number of special features:The movie is still in Aramaic and Latin, with subtitles. The purpose of this is to avoid ""bringing Jesus into today's world"" and rather force the viewer back in time, as if you were a witness to the actual events. Disc 1 has both the theatrical and re-cut version of the film, complete with accompanying commentaries by filmmakers, cinematographers, producers, musical directors and theologians. A particularly wonderful feature is an enhanced viewing mode featuring Biblical footnotes while the movie is playing. Disc 2 features one reasonably in-depth behind-the-scenes/making-of documentary. The other features on this disc include mini featurettes on religious art, ancient languages, a short showcase of the actual places in Jerusalem where the Stations of the Cross occurred, production art, a couple of deleted scenes, and a few other things like actors' bios and (disappointingly short) lives of the saints.Personally, I found the discussion regarding ancient languages most interesting. Fr.Fulco, who served as historical and ancient language consultant during the scripting, shooting and post-production of the film, is erudite and well spoken. The section on religious art was quite engaging, but a bit disappointing in its superficiality (perhaps because I have a particular interest in art history and love the details). It would have been nice, for example, if the names of artists and some details of the pieces accompanied the art documentary and the art gallery. However, in exchange, the DVD gives a great mini documentary on crucifixion as a mode of punishment and execution.As far as the behind-the-scenes features, most touching were Jim Caviezel's humble and soft-spoken interview, during which he (and others) describes the physical, mental and spiritual anguish he was made to endure during the making of this movie -- which include, but are not limited to, eight-hour makeup sessions, itching, migraine headaches, freezing weather (while in a loin cloth), being whipped for real, having the several-hundred-pound cross fall on him and crush his skull, and being struck by lightning.Over these past three years, I have often wondered (with great frustration) why they didn't include extras on the DVD release of ""The Passion of the Christ."" Perhaps the reason was that they did not want people to view this as a regular movie, concentrating on how it was made, etc. Rather, they wanted people to take the movie as it was and concentrate on the message and the emotional/spiritual impact that it had on them, as viewers. Whether Catholic/Christian, Jewish, agnostic or atheist, it is sure to have profound impact on the very fiber of every human being.This re-release comes at a good time -- just when the movie is starting to fade from people's minds. The strong impact that it had three years ago is starting to taper out, and people are settling back into their fast-paced modern lives, which too often results in a distilling of religious convictions and a laxity of spiritual fervor.Well, Lent is around the corner (February 21, 2007), and this movie makes a wonderful accompaniment to spiritual preparation during this time.For those who have never seen the movie, now is the time.For those who have seen it, but don't particularly care to see it again -- The extras may give you a new appreciation for the film and spark a sudden desire to watch it over again. This may move you to meditate on its scenes, pray and feel closer to God.And that is a very good thing."	5.0	The Definitive Edition...	2007-02-04	24	19	5

When I first heard that I thought it was more nonsensical Hollywood hype.After seeing The Passion I have no doubt that conversions happened on the set.Never have I seen a film that could touch me so deeply inside as this one. When the movie finished, I just sat there silent along with most of the rest of the audience trying to let the whole thing absorb.I now know Gibson to be a genius of the highest order. This is not a mindless fest of violence as some reviewers want to claim, Those who claim such a thing did not see the same movie I saw.This is an artistic work of genius and deeply spiritual in a way I have never seen in any other visual medium. The story of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ, interspersed with flashbacks to earlier periods or events tells such apowerful and moving message that no review could possibly do it justice.I promise you that no person can walk out of this presentation without being touched in one place of another.

It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously, because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A15GYIWLUP59RU	Alex Antonopoulos	If someones asks you what is a movie,or a film,I guess the right answer would be that it's a continuing view of images which appear incredibly fast,thus creating us the illusion of moving pictures.Films are supposed to entertain us,and sometimes even give us a message.''THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST'' does all that(entertaiment is not only having fun,but also getting in touch with your feelings)-but not only that.In this film we watch the last hours of Jesu's mortal life.This incudes aucorse a lot of blood and a lot of whips.Many people said that the film shows those scenes just to impress.Others say that they are over the edge-meaning Jesus wasn't beaten that much.And some others even think that there is no historical proof that Christ existed(you don't need proof to believe,but anyway).Now,I could spend two hours on my computer writing why they are wrong,but unfortuently this is a movie review so I am not allowed.All I can say to them is this:You are mistaken.For the ''over the edge scenes'',and ''Jesu's existense'' you will have to read some books,but for the ''violent scenes just to impress'' I can explain.The film is not about that.The film shows you the innoscense of Jesus,like a simple man,and like a Messiah.Then we are shown the people's reaction on His innoscense,His love to the same people that beat Him,while they beat Him.An alternate title for this movie could never be ''How to beat up Jesus'',but it sure could be ''What did our sins done to Him''.This film is not about violence,this movie is about love.I saw this film,and when it ended,I felt like I saw the most innoscent film on the planet.I suggest you watch this masterpiece.If you are good-hearted,open-minded,and read some books,this movie could change your life.	5.0	This  is  more  then  a  movie.	2005-03-01	5	5	0

The Cinema was seemingly empty.No one was in ""fifty first dates"", nor were they in ""Euro trip"". Acrowd could be heard from outside the theatre playing the Passion.Believers and non sat talking to each other. Among the words youcould here were ""Aramaic"" and ""Anti-semitic"".  The noise was soloud it got to the point where you had to lean in to hear the personnext to you. Then The icon productions logo hit the screen.Everyone was silenced. It had begun.During the course of this roughly two hour film, Jesus is flogged,rocks are thrown at him, he is kicked, punched, dragged, crucifiedand killed. Is it violent? Yes. It is the most violent film you mightever see. But is it too violent? No. It becomes clear not far into themovie that the violence isn't horrific. Gibson and Jim Caviezelmake it poetic. People in the audience were brought to tears. It'smoving.The Jews are portrayed in two lights. Obviously the Jewish priestsare snarling, evil, killers. And then there is Mary Magdeline andThe virgin Mary, and some other Jews who help Jesus. TheAnti-semitic rumors fade away fast. While the line ""Let his blood beon us and our children"" is kept in, it is said under the crowd and thesubtitle has been removed.Many say ""Why spend two hours on the death of Jesus and notshow the resurrection?"". Well the ending of the movie clearlyshows why. It's much more powerful that way. Nothing should bechanged. Nothing.This movie is not just a movie. It's a work of art. A fluently movingpicture. It touches you. It captivates you. You will not go to thebathroom, you will not get popcorn, and you will not take a drinkof your Coke. You will be there. The film makes you feel that youare there. And if not it makes you want to be, just to see Jesus.This film is beautiful in every way.As the movie ended we sat. Some were crying. Others just sat. Weall sat for a while, regaining composure. It was a bittersweet feeling.We had all gone through the same thing. We feel the pain but yetwe feel joy. And so we sat. The theatre lights came on and wesilently exited. We had no questions about antisemitism or aboutwhat had happened or even why it had happened. We stood andleft silently. Because we understood.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1GIC1X7GJUPCO	Alias	"This is a disturbing, yet beautifully filmed, brutal, hard-to-watch, makes you think movie, and in a way has it's place as a ""must see."" However, the scourging of Christ here is WAY over the top. I mean he would be dead by the time he started carrying the cross in this movie. He literally has no skin by the time they make him carry his burden and they keep whipping him. By the time they flip him over while he's nailed and raise him up, he'd be a corpse. I know he's the son of God, and it's a modern depiction of the passion play made popular in the middle ages, and the weight of our sins is represented symbollically in the amount of pain portrayed, but it's misleading to say it's historically accurate in this aspect. Yeah cruxifiction was brutal, but this is ridiculous. Gibson needs some mental help.Besides the gratuitous bloodbath, I think the main thing that keeps this from being a classic is Gibson, after 2 hours of horrifying torture, gives about 15 seconds portraying the most important part of the story: The Resurrection. Yes, Christ died terribly for all of our sins but it's when he RISES from this death that finally justifies his claim as ""Son of God."" Check out the end of ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" to see how powerful the Resurrection can be potrayed, then imagine how great it could've been with this movie's special FX and mood. I just think it would've given more hope at the end, which is the point of the ""story"". We watch this man graphically die, now show us the rest of it and how he's MORE than a man. Gibson shows him getting up and running away, but that's it. No ascension into heaven and it kind of loses the spirituality of the conclusion of Christ's time on earth. His greatest moment wasn't the cruxifiction, it was his rebirth and this movie misses the point.Now if only Caviezal and Gibson would do a prequal, only without the over the top, gratuitous B-horror movie violence that makes ""Braveheart"" look like a G-rated kiddie flick."	3.0	Misses the Point 2.5 **	2006-03-20	15	9	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2P8F46NL1WEYR	Alison Dowd	Showing the full range of human brokenness and brutality through starkly intense, strikingly powerful imagery in its depiction of the final 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ, this film is penance, not entertainment.  At the same time, every Sunday I hear our priest repeat the words of the Eucharistic Prayer, &#34;This is my blood of the New Covenant, poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins&#34; etc. during Holy Communion.  &#34;The Passion of the Christ&#34; emphasizes the literal Body and Blood of Christ, mostly through visuals alone until the end, with flashback sequences of Holy Week events giving additional emphasis to the themes of forgiveness, atonement, humility, grace, love, hope, and eternal life.  To me, this film offers a link, albeit emotionally wrenching, between the Passion in Gospels and the Lord's Supper as we receive it.It's been 10 or so years since this film was release in theatres, so you likely know: This is a graphic and brutal film.  For all that I find it spiritually uplifting, my 12-year-old granddaughter is not old enough to watch it.  For understanding the Passion, the Stations of the Cross on Good Friday is perfectly fine at her age and even that may be over her head.  Parents should be prepared before renting or buying this film.  Actually, everyone should be prepared.  There are scenes that are hard to watch, even on the small screen.  I can stomach some pretty violent movie content when seeking to be mindlessly entertained, but this is a different category of experience.  That said, if your personal spiritual or religious beliefs include the belief that Christ died on the Cross for the sins of the world (or something similar, or your religious practice includes Holy Communion or Stations of the Cross, I encourage you to pause and reflect before avoiding this film simply because of the graphic content.	5.0	Amazing, powerful film, but penance, not entertainment.	2014-02-17	3	2	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AMH3MVGRC2YG	"Allen Bessanson ""Framster"""	"As anyone can see just from the comments, Jesus is the still most important person ever to live on earth. The heart of the matter, who IS Jesus? He offended the important because he sojorned with the lowly. He spoke hope to those who would hear. His message resounds even today as many celebrate His birth, although the noise floor of modern life and media would drown it out.Mankind's wholesale will to err and inability to adhere to moral or ethical standards doesn't invalidate the standard. The message Jesus brought is certified by our very nature to sin. Our own efforts to be moral from any cuiltural or religious perspective would eventually lead to hatred of Jesus. As seen in the film, among the motives the Sanhedrin had to kill Jesus was fulfill a commandment to execute a blasphemer.No film until ""The Passion of the Christ"" had shown how Jesus was marred more than any man. The deliberate depiction of the process of His execution shows that God loves us enough to send His own Son to die a cruel death that we might be saved. Anyone who understands Jesus' mission and still is not moved by this film is truly numb in heart. The gift Jesus brought us was rejected yet not taken back. We can still have what Jesus bought for us with His death. Who else can love like that?We need the Savior, now more than ever."	4.0	Jesus still evokes controversy after 2 millenia!	2010-01-01	6	2	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3NQU1649SH0Q4	"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,"""	".To me Mel Gibson's stunning THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST may not be ""world class"" but is close to it, as memorable in its way as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS or AMARCORD and worthy of such enduring acceptance.Was Gibson's life-work anti-Semitic?  In my opinion, no.  Blame Herod, who is at all times righteous, unbending, fixated on Jesus' technical violations of Hebraic codes and totally hypocritical when viewed against his son's sybaritic, Romanized and decadent lifestyle -- truly a Pharisee!  But the film's plotwork:  the New Testament book of Mark, Chapters 14 through end, with flashbacks to Chapter 13, give us sufficient motivation to the Herod character by mentioning his ""envy"" of Jesus--surely that ""envy"" could only be spiritual and not material or political, except political-by-indirection?  The other two Synoptic Gospels, Matthew and Luke, enhance the motif.Also, Gibson's film portrays not so much ""the mob,"" ""the crowd,"" ""the Jews,"" or what other popular English-language bible translations have calling for Jesus' crucifixion after Barabbas' release; rather, the film clearly shows Pilate offering the option that Jesus be spared or executed after physical chastisement and Herod himself specifically calling for His crucifixion and then, the heavy majority (but NOT all) of those gathered chiming in.Perhaps the film can be gently blamed for over-sympathizing with the Romans, but the pendulum swung both ways.  The centurions and soldiers charged with whipping Jesus were clearly a sadistic lot who specialized in torture and crucifixion, ogre-like in appearance, with heavy broad noses and dark brown eyes.  (They both looked and acted subhuman.)  On the other hand, and I think Gibson is using Italian racial sub-typing to his advantage, the common soldiers whose task it was to accompany Christ to Golgotha, while keeping away the locals who wanted a piece of Him, had more clearly Piedmontese features, aquiline noses and hazel eyes.An excellent Eastern Bloc actor played Pontius Pilate and invested the character with a great deal of sympathy by means of ""close acting"" that showed the dilemma Pilate was in:  the necessity of practical politics overriding the desirability of treating Jesus in a more humane, common-sense manner (at least according to Roman  AD 30 standards).  In one of the few additions to material not found in Matthew, Mark or Luke; Lydia, Pilate's wife, brings several clean white-linen pieces of cloth to Mary and Mary Magdalene.  We, the largely Christian audience, know that these will become relics.Was THE PASSION OF CHRIST violent?  In a B-movie sense, meaning gratuitous brawling and blood-letting, no.  It was true to the text in that it portrayed the last 12 hours of Jesus' life in a graphic, literarily ""ash-can"" Naturalistic fashion, right down to the maggots crawling out of the head of a dead donkey within Judas' vision as he slumps against a tree in terror.  (Judas never has a moment's peace after he tries to return the thirty coins to Herod.)  So while THE PASSION was not violent, it was gruesome; but it was gruesome within the bounds of what the Bible tells us took place.  Perhaps nationally-syndicated film critic Roger Ebert said it best when he said that only Mel Gibson's standing within the movie industry let this film be branded an ""R"" instead of an ""NC-17.""Should ""Mainline"" or ""Liberal"" Protestants like Methodists, Lutherans or Presbyterians see this film?  YES!  Why not, if they've a mind to?  Avoiding this film out of mere squeamishness would merely validate the stereotype that ""Establishment"" believers are a bunch of comfortable wishy-washies who are all for confronting the realities of life, death and poverty--as long as we subsidize it and someone else does the job of facing the actual ickies.I learned a lot from this film.  Personally, it was cathartic as well as riveting.  Interestingly, as with most people at the cinema, what provoked the tears was not so much the cruelty but the response along the lines of ""Do you REALIZE what you're DOING and to WHOM?"".  Because everybody killed Jesus.  And everybody is capable of killing God and killing us, too.  Roman Catholic doctrine such as the veneration of Mary and Imitatio Dei were opened up to me in ways I'd never understood before.Personally, I urge anyone with the slightest interest to see THE PASSION OF CHRIST, and not to write it off as some spiritual howler meant only as a sock to the jaw for the most hard-headed kind of R.C.'s or Evangelical Protestants in buses.  I don't think you'll regret it."	5.0	A BLUNT BUT SUPERB FILM - TRUE TO ITS SOURCE	2004-03-17	11	7	4

Normally everybody would just get up and walk out and start talking with their friends and family. This was an experience you can not put to words. I will never experience anything like this again.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1E110L9ZKX6FD	All Powerful Wizard Of Oz	Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen. Pretty much that is what this movie is. 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured. Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line, this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here, nope just two hours of beatings and torture.	5.0	** 5 stars for Gore, 0 stars for content! **	2004-09-03	24	10	14

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ANUWEAJ7WGRWB	Almostchris	"This is the worst movie NOT about Jesus ever made! Instead of making a film about Christ's life and/or his message, Mel Gibson makes a slasher flick about what the government can do to another human being. If you are a twisted person who enjoys watching over 2 hours of obsessive blood & torture, then you will love this absurd gore-fest. Otherwise, it's an obscene, narrowly focused, remote, spiritually uninvolving, and amateurishwaste of time. The acting is average and there is an anti-Semitic message simmering at the surface of this mess. Even Satan is portrayed as a cliche---an ambisexual hooded figure lurking in the background of several scenes. There is nothing new here except that all of the actors speak in Aramaic, which is distracting since you must read subtitles. The slow motion scenes are so self-conscious that the film becomes tedious to watch after awhile. Plus, there are historical inaccuracies contained within, like the fact that Romans did not nail spikes into Jesus' hands but his wrists. Overall, this movie told me next-to-nothing about the man called Jesus of Nazareth. The only vaguely interesting part of the film was the music, which reminded of the excellent music from ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" composed by Peter Gabriel. (The CD is titled ""Passion"".) In fact, if you want to watch a deeply moving, spiritual film, rent or buy ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", which was a gritty, realistic interpretation of Jesus' life, and contained a rare look at the human side of Jesus. (It seemed to me that Gibson was influenced by this movie and decided to do his own version but failed miserably.)"	1.0	"Not about ""Passion"" or about ""Christ"" (A waste of celluloid)"	2005-11-08	31	13	18

If this film were based on historical evidence, no one would have even cared when this film came out and it would have just been a very violent Roman film similar to ""300.""Instead, the film is based on one man's (Gibson) interpretation of the Bible, so it's allowed to throw facts out the window (the location of the wounds, nudity, etc. - it's all been said by hundreds of other people) and just show crazy amounts of carnage and brutality and disturbing visuals.

Never in my life have I ever been so emotionally moved by a movie...There is one scene where Jesus is carrying the cross he stumbles and falls.. Then the scene flashes back to Jesus as a little boy about 5 running he falls down. His mother runs to pick him up... The scene changes again, to Mary reaching out to Jesus as he falls with (our) cross... How I could feel the pain being mother.. My heart broke.From that point on I couldn't keep my eyes dried.. I couldn't stop thinking, how can people be so vicious and cruel to this man? Who did nothing wrong other than teach love and kindness? All the way to the end, hanging there with his hands and feet nailed to a cross, telling his father to forgive them, they know not what they do.. Would any of us be able to forgive to that extent?I also believe Mel when he stated, ""the Holy Spirit moved him to make this movie."" I find it ironic that no one would back Mel in the making of this movie. That he took 25 million dollars of his own money to make it. And on the first day the movie broke even, little to say what the total gross will be. Sounds like God was more than satisfied with Mel's creation.The movie is very graphic and I had to turn away at times. I know this is one thing Mel is criticized for. But, don't you think a crucifixion was more then likely a horrible thing to see and maybe this is what it was really like? I also didn't see where it look like Mel made it seems like the Jews killed Jesus. What I got out of the movie was everyone was responsible for Jesus death, even I. That the movie was the greatest love story even told. A love story between a mother and son. A love story between God and us.The movie's music, scenery, lighting effects are remarkable and mystifying. The devil is stunning and beautiful to look at in a eerie sort of way.By the end I couldn't move for minutes and just sat engulf motionless.My verdict - A unforgettable spiritual miraculous masterpiece."	5.0	A unforgettable spiritual miraculous masterpiece	2004-02-28	8	7	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AE8LL9S715YTE	"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2"""	"In commemoration of this passion week, I have watched this movie again.  I saw it when it came out in theaters, and I own it on DVD.  As a seminary student, I wish to say a few things about this movie.  Whether or not you agree with me, that is your deal, say what you wish yourself about it.  First off, I want to say I do not like this film.  This is not a fun film.  This is not a film you would go to the Blockbuster to rent on a Friday night, to watch while eating popcorn.  This is a film about Good Friday.  This is a film about the Cross and Jesus' sacrifice.  Thus leads to the second point.  Secondly, this is a brutal film because...and if we are realistic about the Biblical narrative and the history behind the practice of torture and crucifiction by the Romans...we are talking about a truly violent event.  More than violent though, debasingly brutal in every extreme.  There was blood.  There was torn flesh.  There were cries of pain, even from Jesus' lips.  Ergo, we should not turn a blinds eye and forget the true power of what occurred that Friday two thousand years ago.  We should come to this movie in solomn understanding that what we are watching is not going to be enjoyable, but it is necessary for us to see so that we don't ""pretty"" the Gospel and skip over the drops of blood from Christ Jesus' body during those hours.  This was a sacrifice in all sense of the words, Jesus was...and is...our ""Scapegoat,"" replacing us and bearing the sins for us so that we may (through Him and only Him) come to the Father, Yahweh.  I watch this film because I have to, I need to, I need to be reminded and I need to be counseled in the ways of our Lord and Savior, the one true God, Yahweh, who shows Himself to the world as Jesus Christ.  I must be reminded and be mindful of what Jesus did that Friday along with the Sunday afterwards.  I need to be thoughtful toward the everlasting Gospel of God.  Even though I may disagree with some of the symbolism used (mostly Catholic), I still can take a lot from the film and learn.With that said, I wish to speak to those who have been belittling and accusing this film.  First and foremost, yes it is a Catholic film and there are a lot of Catholic imagery in it.  The way the movie portrays Mary is very Catholic in terms of how she acts and how she is presented.  Is this a bad thing?  Well, as a Protestant seminarian, I have to say, no not for me at any rate.  I understand what is being shown, and while I may disagree with it, I have myself no problem in holding out a hand in friendship to Catholics (i.e., I don't believe in Catholic badging like some people seem to be doing just because Mr. Gibson is a Catholic and uses Catholicism in the story narrative).  Still, you may feel that Mary the mother is given more power than she is truly given in the Bible, for as we read the Bible, and we know the Bible's truth, we see that Mary was just one woman who had given her life to Jesus by accepting the mantel of being the mother.  She is not glorified as the Catholics say she is, in the Bible if you have read your Bible, but she is shown to be a woman (just as mortal as you and I) of faith.  Secondly, I wish to say...as a supporter for such organizations as Jews for Jesus...this film in my opinion is not Anti-Semitic.  There is no Anti-Semitism in this film.  This film does not go out of its way to show the Jews as the ""bad guys"" because, if you were watching the same film I was watching, the film showed that there were Jews of all kinds at this dark day-Jews like John the Apostle, Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the Magdalene, to name a few...then again, it also shows there were wicked men who happened to be Jewish, i.e., the priests who were (if you have read your New Testament and trusted in its authority) of evil hearts toward Jesus.  What this film does is take it out of its Western European pageantry that has been so self evident in Hollywood and placed the true story of Jesus' death and resurrection back to its Jewish roots.  If you really wish to know more about the Bible, and about what the Bible says what happens, read it.  But please, don't throw demons in where there aren't any in the first place.  The film does not assault Jews.  Plain and simple.I hope that you watch this film and consider who Jesus is.  Who Jesus really is.  If you have questions about who God is, Yahweh through Jesus Christ, Yeshua, I suggest you go to my ""so if you are interested in...guides"" I've made on Amazon."	5.0	With much thought, I wish to say a few things...	2004-02-19	0	0	0

I agree with the other reviewer in that I wouldn't allow children any younger than 12 or 13 to view this film due to it's graphic and disturbing violence.The movie is very, very intense - it's also very, very good.  Very sobering.  When you see a crucifix in a church or in a store, Jesus looks all perfect and peaceful hanging from it - Gibson's movie shows the reality that Jesus was beaten and whipped to a bloody pulp before being hung up on the cross, and it wasn't a pretty sight.  It makes one realize, as a Christian, what He really went through for US - and it's very humbling.Have a box of tissues next to you when you watch this - you'll need it.

Instead of responding to them all individually I have decided to reply in the reivew.  As such I want to state that I have read both the articles in Time and News Week.  Articles that point out the anti-semantic over tones of this film.I find it ironic that scine I have a different opinion of this film, no one is saying this review is helpful.  I just feel that it is my duty to point out that this film tends to make the Jews out to be the bad guys.  In fact this filmed was banned over seas, in the fear that it may start a riot against the local Jewish populations.My review once again:Once again it is frightening to see that a number one movie would be so closely tied into religion.  After all aren't Americans supposed to be tolerant of all faiths, not just their  particular view.Either way this movie scared me since it feels like a call to arms against both the Jews and the Arabs.

I am 39 years old and I cannot find the words to express to anyone the expanse, magnitude and brilliance that this movie of The Final hours of Jesus Christ has left within me other than an imprint  as deep within as the mystery of the universe itself.As a young catholic growing up, I remember seeing the movie on TV called, ""Francis of Assisi"", starring Bradford Dillman, Dolores Hart (who became an actual nun in 1971) and Stuart Whitman.  It was and is one of the greatest movies in the history of Religious Film Making with The Passion of The Christ as Number One and Francis as Number two.  No film of St. Francis or any kind then, made such an impression on me, that I actually took His name as mine for my Confirmation Name because I became so ""hypnotized"", if you will, that I became more aware that anyone can desire such holiness and attain such (Holy) Valor as Francis did, for me, when I was only 11.Buy this film!!  See ""The Passion of The Christ"" Come Alive for you as you have never seen anything like it ever before!!!So that to see for yourselves what Jesus went through in His Final Hours for our redemption and to accomplish for us something so beautiful through such anguish and pain never before witnessed, that to this day, as I hold the DVD in my hands still unwrapped since I saw it on The Big Screen, it remains in me, as if imprinted on my very soul.Maybe a person may see this film as an atheist and leave it as an atheist, but I know one thing.

The pain they inflict upon him...is so violent...so real...you cant help but look away.I have been told by people that i am a horrible person for not being able to watch the violence inflicted upon Jesus...and i just think...is it so horrible not being able to stand viloence and pain inflicted on another and not react to it? what is the problem with that?  The point is to feel outraged...to feel sorrow for this man who died so that we may live.

Never has a movie so violently assaulted my senses, affected my behavior, changed my thinking.There are many things to reflect on and talk about after seeing it, the group I was with went to a coffee place and discussed the movie for some time afterwards.  There are many symbolic things in the film, and a couple of people that night had already seen the movie twice, even though it'd only been out two days, and they commented on things they caught the second viewing that'd been missed the first time around.There is a lot of blood.  Christ's blood.  He died for the sins of the world and shed his blood for humanity.  That is the basic premise and story line.  This isn't the 'Matrix', a great film with a Christology all it's own and ton's of symbolism, this is the shocking and offensive story of what Jesus did.  Raw and offensive and ugly.  He died naked and beaten on a cross of wood.If I would have a complaint about the depiction, as horrible and brutal as it was, was that the Christ was shown with the obligatory wrapping at the waist.  In the movie 'Schindler's List' one of the great (in the sense of effecting the emotion of the viewer) scenes was when the prisoners had to line up naked and there, in shame and humiliation, await death.  I'm curious as to why full frontal male nudity was used there but not here as it would have been more faithful to the text.  However, it's a small complaint, the scenes were plenty graphic and shocking and I believe that the film followed scripture pretty faithfully with the occasional ""artistic license"" not getting too much in the way.I'm probably in the minority here, wondering why the movie wasn't even more graphic, but I'll stand my ground on that one.  If we are going to see what we did to Jesus, at least from a traditional viewpoint, we might as well take as much of the medicine as we can.  For those that don't understand the traditional Christian viewpoint of what the cross means, it means this:  Jesus hung there for you.  That's the story, whether you believe it or not or care to see it depicted or not, that's it.  That's the story that Mel Gibson, I believe, wanted to show on the screen.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2KLT8PCDS4YZY	"Amazon Customer ""x_opp"""	After watching this movie I think Mel Gibson missed the point of Christ dying.  His movie seemed to focus more on the beating and torture of Christ than the result of his death.  It is important to understand that Christ died because of all of us.  The Jews, Christians, Atheists, Agnostics, and everyone alike.  It makes no difference who physically killed Christ the symbolism is that he dies for all of our sins.  Most great people have focused on the return of Christ from the dead, this is the imporatant point.  His return and the salvation of mankind.  I think Gibson believes that we should all be reminded how brutal Christ's death was, but this is disrespectful to his image and completely disregards what this event meant for mankind.  As for the film being anti-semetic, I think it is, but only for those who ignore the fact that Chrsit died because of our sins and we all sin.  All of us are responisible and people should keep that in mind, at least all who believe in the Christian faith.	2.0	Missed The Point!!!	2004-02-26	8	4	4

I don't believe Mel Gibson's purpose in making this movie was to make money.  I have read many interviews (Reader's Digest, Guideposts, etc.) in Christian based magazines and seems to me the most important goal for Mr. Gibson was to get the message of Christianity to the masses, which I believe he did in a very effective way.I bought the DVD last night (...) and watched it as soon as I woke up this morning.  Yes, I am aware there are no special features.  Yes, I am aware there is no bonus material.  Is it so important?  Is it so significant?  With this movie I believe it is not.

Heavily criticized for it's brutal depiction of the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, and maligned by some for encouraging anti semetism, I found it powerful and very moving, if disturbing. It is a testament to Mel Gibson's vision, and perseverance that NO major Hollywood studio picked up this picture, which was self funded by Mr Gibson at a cost of around $30 million. The fact that the dialogue is chiefly aramaic (the movie is subtitled throughout) could also be seen as enough to discourage a lot of viewers, but there is no doubt that this is powerful film making at it's best. Perhaps ""enjoy"" is the wrong word to use in how I felt after the movie which is violent and unforgiving in showing Christ's persecution and eventual execution on the cross, but it is compelling, absorbing and emotionally charged. The success of the picture (I feel) lies in the what has been the chief subject of critisicm, the blow by blow punishment and torture the viewer cannot help but share with the main character. However, perhaps this is the strength of the movie, and I believe Gibson's aim, in showing what has always been hinted at, or happened ""off screen"" in other films of the genre. Put simply, it is saying that knowing or saying that Christ suffered and died for our sins is not enough, this is how, and why, open, graphic and painful. Not a movie I would recommend for the squeamish or sensitive, and certainly NOT for children (of any age). James Caveziel is believable and strong in the lead role, and more than ably supported by a cast of almost unknowns. Top marks all round, a film that will live in the memory long after you have seen it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AZ5Q84NH9DY6L	A. M. Hatfield	"I have seen Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", twice. In many ways it is a beautiful if profoundly disturbing film. It certainly demonstrates with uncompromising and graphic detail, the physical suffering that Christ had to endure because of the sins of humanity. After the first viewing of the film, I had concluded it was a little ""over the top"" in terms of the amount and duration of the graphic violence. I found myself sympathetic with what I felt were Gibson's motivations for making the film but intolerant of his technique. I fervently believed at that time that Gibson could have achieved the same impact by merely suggesting violence, by even threatening the possibility of graphic detail without actually ever wallowing in it as he did. I was happy to share that opinion with anyone who was interested. Gibson of course was after a much more visceral reaction from his audience. Gibson wanted to rub people's noses in Christ's suffering and in their own culpability in that suffering. From being forced to view the pieces of flesh and chunks of bone which were torn from Christ's body during the scourging. we were sickened. This was followed by the barely recognizable Christ, with most of the skin tissue lashed from his body, forced to carry His Cross in unknowable agony up to Calvary. This left us gasping with the mixed emotions of revulsion, anger, pity and despair. Ending with the gut-wrenching hammering of the spikes into His bloodied limbs and His flopping helplessly on the Cross like some recently caught fish on a filleting board. We were overwhelmed by the horror of crucifixion.. Curiously, as the weeks passed after my first viewing of the film, a parallel memory, which I had virtually ignored in my disgust with the graphic violence, started to assert itself in sharp relief. I remembered, particularly during Christ's scourging and during his struggle up to Calvary, how struck I was, as if by a hammer, with a sense of the unrelenting intractability of both Satanic and human evil. It was this parallel insight into the nature of evil, which brought me back to watch the film for a second time. On the second viewing I was equally repulsed by the violence but equally I confirmed the great and unapologetic statement Gibson was making about evil and the terrible suffering Christ willingly endured to combat it. Perhaps the degree of graphic detail was not necessary but then again, perhaps, in this age of insensate and clobbered audiences, it was. Sensationalist media coverage of inner city violence, Iraqi terrorism, forced relocations in Darfur, Rwandan machete genocide, etcetera, have numbed and alienated us all from our own emotions. That Gibson, despite the howling of his critics and at considerable professional risk, felt it was necessary to rub our noses in our own filth and degradation for the sake of our possible salvation, is a credit to him as a Christian, an artist and a man."	5.0	"""The Passion of the Christ"" pulls no punches."	2005-01-02	11	9	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A38I8IFPNN7BM2	Anastacia	"I skimmed though about 200 of the Amazon reviews prior to watching the film for the first time today (there is no way I am going to read through 1700 plus reviews, though).  What I read gave me a good insight into what makes the Mel haters tick.While some of the detractors of the film wrote thoughtful, valid reviews, others clearly were militant atheists who are deeply offended, not just by the movie (which often was not even mentioned in the reviews) but by Christianity and the very idea that billions out there still believe in God.  Amusingly, an illiterate, childish bigot (who appears to be posting under multiple names - really, get a life) repeatedly blasts Christians for being ""stupid"" and ""intolerant.""  My advice: take a good long look in the mirror.I thought that Jews had valid reasons to be concerned prior to the release of the film.  But I did not see one post by someone who gave this movie 5 stars blasting Jews as ""Christ-killers"" and I have yet to meet a ""Passion"" fan who expressed any anger or resentment towards Jews as a result of this movie.  Nor did I read of any incidents of seething moviegoers exiting the theaters to go beat up the nearest Jews they could find.  I would suggest to those who still think TPOTC promotes anti-semitism that they would be better off protesting Eygptian TV's recent airing of ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" or the rave reviews the Palestinian propaganda piece ""Jenin, Jenin"" received in France.  (Yes, the country which so ""nobly"" banned ""The Passion"" - where Jews are attacked and synagogues are burned and vandalized far, far more frequently than they are in ""right-wing Christian"" America.)I thought the film exceptionally beautiful and powerful.  As a lapsed Catholic who recently returned to the Church, I recognized the Stations of the Cross brought to the screen in a visually compelling, moving way.  A Protestant reviewer decried the Catholic elements in the film.  Well - Gibson is a Catholic, after all. After sinking $30 million of his own money into a film, he had the right to depict the Crucifixion through the prism of his own faith.  I have spoken to Protestants who said that the film stuck closely enough to Scriptures that they were able to overlook - and in several cases, barely noticed - the specifically ""Catholic"" themes that arose.The two bits of poetic license that Gibson took which I did not care for were the scenes where Jesus is thrown over the bridge and the scene where the ""bad thief's"" eye is pecked out.  (I did notice that Gibson has a ""thing"" for eyes - Christ's eye is swollen shut throughout most of the film, one of the high priests wears an eyepatch, and Barabbas and a few of the characters in the crowd appear to be blinded in one eye.) Those were the only false notes I saw in the movie.  The demonic children who torment Judas?  Well, remember that Judas is going insane at that point.  Those children vanish in an instant when he decides to hang himself.  The grotesque baby cradled by the Devil?  Another Catholic theme - clearly meant to be a mockery of the Madonna and Child.One of my degrees is in art history and I am startled by how few of the intelligent detractors of the violence in the film recognize that bloody depictions of the Crucifixion are one of the major themes of medieval and Renaissance art. It is shallow to say that those graphic images were simply exercises in sadism; they were intended to arouse pity and awe and reverence for Christ's sacrifice in the viewer.  Gibson wanted the same effect, and he succeeded.  There were moments when I felt as though a Caravaggio or a Grunewald painting had come to life before my eyes.Jim Caviezel said that he prayed during the filming that when people saw TPOTC they would not ""see"" him at all; they would see Christ instead.  I think his prayers were granted; while watching the film I didn't think ""Caviezel's really doing a great job;"" I simply saw Christ.  Now that I'm in front of a computer screen typing I can praise the utterly natural way the actors spoke 2 dead languages, but I didn't focus on the languages at all when I was watching.  I simply watched, and let myself be deeply moved.Unbelievers may scoff and write juvenile sneers (you're really not a good advertisement for supposed atheistic rationality, you know); others might prefer a sanitized, cotton-candy Christ.  I for one, will be forever grateful to Gibson for giving us his gritty, bloody, and frequently sublime ""Passion."""	5.0	The passion of Mel's critics	2005-07-20	17	12	5

I like how it touched base with Christs' last temptation which WAS NOT temptation for a woman but satan tempting Him not to die for us because we don't deserve it. I also liked the relationship status briefs it shows on Him and His disciples. For a believer, and someone whom is a reader of the Bible and believes it, this will bring to life what you have read, and for those whom do not believe..this film will probably be just another over-dramatic film (I've heard these terms from some folk thats why I mention it here).Over all, the acting was great but of course I do agree with some when they say this is not a film that you watch over pop corn and soda pop...However, I just wish they would have left the first version of Mel's film alone, how funny to complain about an accurate descriptive film (that includes violence) and yet we except pornography and MUCH more violence in everyday films...just go to show how our world is running today.

While there is so much talk regarding the brutality depicted in the movie, people need to realize that the brutality is factual, and that this is what Christ endured for us. I don't see the anti-Semitic bent seen by others in the movie. I think Mel Gibson was even handed in showing that all of mankind was responsible for the death of Christ, be he Roman, Jew or Christian. The movie is captioned due to the fact that it is spoken in the language of the time, Aramaic. However, you are not even aware of reading while you are watching the movie. The acting is incredible, the special effects daunting, and all in all, the movie is life changing. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in search of spiritual awakening or redemption.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2EZED4LGRCUS5	Andrew A. Nyberg	"A good friend of mine has spent a large part of his professional life trying to decide how the church should properly respond to the postmodern movement and how to best minister to the children of postmodernity (look up Tony Jones' books ""Soul Shaper"" and ""Postmodern Youth Ministry"" on amazon.com for more info).  I was talking to him once and was describing how ""unbelievable"" something was and he asked me, ""Is anything really `unbelievable' anymore?  When you say something is unbelievable do you truly mean that it is beyond belief?""The point he was getting at is the importance of shock value to entertainment in our culture.  For movie, television and video game makers, they work in a precarious world where a product's financial success is determined largely by its ability to provide the consumer with something that is new, something that still has shock value, something that is still ""unbelievable.""  As I was waiting to see ""The Passion of the Christ"" the movie theater showed a quick documentary about the making of the movie ""Van Halsing.""  In the documentary the director had said that he had wanted to do a story about Frankenstein, but that had already been done.  He then looked at Dracula and werewolves, but movies about them had been done to, so he decided to put the three together for his movie to provide the audience with something new and exciting.  The problem with this mentality is that you have to keep upping the ante.  Next time there will have to be four monsters, otherwise the audience will go to another movie.""The Passion of the Christ"" was certainly the most shocking Gospel-based movie I have ever seen!  I actually experienced corporeal reactions to the movie as my body tensed during particularly gruesome moments (like when the cat-of-nine-tails dug so far into the body of Jesus that his ribs were exposed, or when they nailed his arms to the cross).  I don't know how a more disturbing movie about the story of Jesus could be made.I give this movie five stars because I believe that Mel Gibson succeeded in what he wanted to achieve with this movie.  I would say that it is nearly impossible to come out of that theater and not be shocked and disturbed.  But the question that is hopefully on the mind of each person at the end of the film is the same question asked by Satan in the garden, Pontius Pilot at the trial and is clearly seen on the faces of the roman guards: ""Who are you, Jesus?""Another friend of mine was on the leadership team for an Christian club when we were in college and she organized a big event were a speaker would address the question ""who is this king of glory?  The organization publicized the event all over campus because they wanted every one on campus to be confronted with the idea of Christ.  In this movie you will be confronted by Christ.  Now don't get me wrong, no one will call you up or try to change your beliefs.  But as you watch the movie look at the people who are confronted with Christ: the woman who gives him water as he carries his cross, Simon of Cyrene (the man who helped carry the cross), Pontius Pilot, the roman guards, Mary Magdalene, Jesus' mother and John who stood with her.  Look at their faces, look in their eyes.  They are all transfixed by the Christ.  The question is not whether you will be confronted but how will you respond?Aside from the theological implications of the movie, I felt that it was beautifully shot and had a lot of interesting symbology and even some fun (did you notice when the woman with the water gave Jesus the towel, his bloody imprint created the relic now known notoriously as the Shroud of Turin!)  The anti-Semitism complaint is complete rubbish.  After all, how many Jews helped Jesus and were sympathetic to his suffering.  If for no other reason you should see the movie because Jesus is the most perplexing person in western history."	5.0	Where do we go from here?	2004-02-29	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A28ODAXRLNIIX3	Andrew Crosby	Seeing this movie was quite a privelege, the sheer fact alone that Mel Gibson got me excited about a religious movie is quite a feet in itself. You see, I am not a very religious person, however I can that as beautiful as this movie was, it sure is not going to change my life. I do have to credit this film however with instilling in me a bit more respect and sympathy for the suffering of the Christian and to some extent the Judeo faiths. To sum it up, if you are already religious this film will reaffirm your beliefs, and if your not, well at the very least it will at least help you to tolerate and to some extent identify with the respected religions that are represented.	5.0	A Great Movie, But Not Life Changing	2004-07-03	10	2	8

The Passion of the Christ is one of those rare movies that finally capture the essence of the material and presents it realistically. Of course, Mel Gibson is the guilty one for making this movie true to form. The Cinematography, the music, the acting is superb and in my opinion, it screams oscars. Making Steven Speilberg proud, he utilizes the camera to give us beautiful shots throughout the movie. But, it's not only the direction, James Caviesel gives a flawless performance to a point where i keep on thinking - "" that's JESUS"". Not only does he look the part, but his performance of sincerity, full of love and Grace makes jesus even more real. Jesus would be proud.Now onto the controverial issues...( Let me make this short and sweet). First off, this movie is NOT anti-semitic and do you know why? well, this might be breaking news to some of you but Jesus is JEWISH! Therefore, if anyone comes out of that theater saying "" i Hate Jews"" ..therefore they hate Christ.Problem solved.Secondly, is the topic of the level of violence shown.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A5KLP39OKXD5P	Ankur Mukherjee	'The Passion of the Christ' is probably one of the most precise, finely crafted films in terms of both presentation and implementation. One cannot easily judge such a film just by taking a glimpse of its trailers or just gazing at the film posters or wallpapers, its only after you get completely lost in the film, you can feel it. Speaking of the  performances, Jim Caviezel as Jesus is beyond the word excellent, very precise in potraying probably the most difficult historical figure in the history of cinema. Along with Caviezel, we are rewarded with outstanding performances from Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci who keep you engaged throughout the film and at the same time giving more life to the film. The rest of the cast is superb and not a single flaw can be found in the entire scenario. The film easily takes you along with it to the last hours of Jesus, making you digest every possible detail during his end hours. One of the most important and rare gems of cinema and the last but not the least person to be applauded is Mel Gibson for making this film unforgettable for years.	5.0	Painful to watch, hard to bare, but still a rewarding cinematic experience!	2012-12-24	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AC41KJDLG0KIE	"Annabel Lee ""Anna"""	This movie may come across as strange or confusing or possibly unrealistic. The sad fact is that the acts shown in this movie are historically accurate. If anything, it has downplayed the beatings and horrible things that were done. The whipping alone had actually lasted hours. He was whipped one whip short of death. Mel Gibson did a great job on presenting this the death of Jesus. What moved me the most was that Jesus willingly endured all of this. This movie is not about Jews verses Christian. Jesus was a Jew by the way. What happened was a historical event the people who wanted him cruxified happened to be jews, but a large majority of the people who followed him and worshipped him were also Jewish. We do not change the history of Germany in movies, because showing what Hitler did to the Jews may come across as anti-german. It happened. We cannot change history. This movie was a great historical movie! I encourage everyone who is curious to learn more about Jesus to pick up a Bible and read the parts (books) called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.It's the most accurate way to learn about the life of Jesus! The best book I have ever read!	5.0	Moved me to tears	2004-09-15	15	10	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2H79ZQ9RI04WO	anna	The film is absolutely amazing.. after watching this movie I really came to realization on what Jesus has done for me.. not only did he Die for the sins of humanity but he endured long hours of suffering and torture just to redeem us all. I am extremely thankful for this film.. not only for myself but for my family and friends. I'm happy that I am saved through the blood of Jesus.. This is a very real story that has taken place and to be able to see it full on means a lot to me because I know FULLY understand the truth behind his ultimate sacrifice, which will no longer be taken lightly.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2XHXIPRWYFMNO	Annemarie Clemente	I have to be honest with you, im not a religous person and that might be the reason that i dont like this film. Ive only been to church once (which was very boring i might add). The real problem with this film is that to me its just a guy getting whip and punched for 2 hours. And you know what that doesnt make for a good movie that makes for a movie that is really boring. The most fun i had watching this film was counting the times jesus got hit and cherring for the jews just so i could be on the winning side.Basiclly if your not a religous person i dont beleve that you will like this movie but if you are religous then you will love this movie (even though you have allready seen it).

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AB4F6UHL20U95	Anne Rice	Gibson created something of enduring magnificence. He did it with intense focus, and total commitment. The refusal of much of the intelligensia to engage in responsible dialogue about this film revealed immense hypocracy and cynicism. The violence is not a legitimate issue. Prime Time television with it crime show obsessions centered on killing children is so much more truly violent as to make public discussions of the cruelty in the Passion of the Christ ridiculous. The Passion achieves a near impossible goal: the accurate dipiction of a first century execution and an embracing vision of the moment that changed the history of the western world, as remembered by those who insist upon that event's  unchanging religious significance. Whatever your beliefs, or lack of beliefs, it's worth your respect and attention.  It's absurd to think children will be harmed by this movie when network television spews lurid stories of kidnapping, maiming, rape, and murder into our homes every night. The film has set a new and very high standard for religious films and identified a huge audience that hungers for spiritual content in media.	5.0	The Film is a Masterpiece.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2T0CJY47M0FHK	Anthony C	"OMG! (oh my Gibson) this movie is fantastic.  I am very skeptical of any action movie that doesn't have at least one robot on robot fight in it, but The Passion of the CHRIST (Centurion Humanoid Robot Intelligence System version - T) was amazing.  Mel Gibson's attention to detail was apparent in every scene.  He even gave J-CHRIST his own archaic robo-language (thank Gibson for subtitles right!).  However, I am still a little perplexed why Gibson decided to set this film in Gladiator times, Crowe already nailed that role and this movie didn't have a single chariot race in it, so what's the point? I suppose I am just nitpicking, the rest of the film was thrilling and packed full of more action than a bang bus on spring break.The Passion of the CHRIST's plot was very post modern and provocative.  In most films, the down on his luck robot cop has to turn in his robo-badge and go home to his unloving abusive robo-wife, but eventually he overcomes the odds and starts smashing robot faces while Drowning Pool's ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" plays in the background. (Note to Mr.Gibson: You need a better soundtrack for the sequel) In this film, however, J-CHRIST takes the pain and continues to higher ground where he can better broadcast his distress signal.  Right as you are expecting the big battle royal finale where J-CHRIST calls in his 12 Mega-Disciplebots to assemble into the Holy Voltrininty, the film takes a dramatic twist and leaves you floored like the gas pedal on a bang bus on spring break once you find out she is actually only fifteen.I love how foolish the Romans were, J-CHRIST was clearing leaking coolant and yet they forced him to carry around a huge heat sink and air cool by walking.  If they wanted to short-circuit his mainframe or possibly override his front-side bus they should have generated a large EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) or simply removed his Intel Cerebral Cortex (tm).  The part I was most confused about was the ending.  I understand that he did a Terminator time travel, the no clothes on and dramatic music bit, but why did he have holes in his Adamantium endoskeleton?  Everyone knows that the classic sign of a time traveling robot is a blast crater with electricity arching off it, not holes in your hands.  I guess it is just another element of Gibson's genius that I am incapable of fully grasping.This film deserves five stars.  The Passion of the CHRIST is a thrill ride within a thrill ride within a Hard Rock Caf&eacute; that will leave you gripping your seats in excitement, not for balance and leverage,  like inside a bang bus on spring break."	5.0	Great Action Flick, Better Than Transformers!!!	2009-10-30	26	9	17
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1UXMT6XQFZLA1	"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony"""	"I attended ""The Passion of the Christ"" this past Thursday at a local multiplex, making the 8 p.m. show minutes before showtime. As the theater card commercials eased into the filmed commercials into the coming attraction commercials, you felt excitement and dread slowly fill the theater. By showtime it grew to  full, a good house for a night dominated for years by ""must see TV."" Murmuring, chomping, bustling, and normal theater activity halted literally from the first scene where, without a title credit, you are placed in the garden as Jesus weeps and prays before His arrest and trial, challenged and victorious over an androgynous devil figure.In the two hours that follow director Mel Gibson, and his stars including Jim Cavieziel as Jesus and Maia Morganstern as His mother Mary, create what can only be considered a religious horror film. They use all trademarks of that genre: slow motion recreations of gore and brutality, tangible depictions and battles between good and evil (including demonic chase and possession), classically-based cinematography and a brooding John Debney musical score. All this in as historically accurate and visually beautiful a setting as such a film could take place. This is not the horror fantasy of Freddy Krueger slashing nubile teens, pointing to his glove and snarling, ""This...is God."" The verbal taunts and physical punishment lie on Jesus, the Saving Victim Christians see as God made man.No one will leave this film unmoved. I and many around me cried seeing a bludgeoned Jesus comforted by (and comforting) His Mother; their scenes on Jesus' walk to Calvary and at His Crucifixion are as simple and heartfelt as the beatings are excruciating. Gibson uses his considerable cinematic skill to slow down and intensify, rather than deflect, violence Christ suffers.His blood, which Christians believe washed sin away, dominates this film. It splatters on His torturers, oozes through the nails on His Cross, spurts from His side a Roman soldier pierces kneeling before Jesus' Cross. (You wish Gibson would have allowed one of those centurions the line, ""Truly this was the Son of God."") This film validates someone fully man as well as fully God suffered for our sins, and felt this unbearable pain doing so. (This, however, does not justify a rather sickening scene at the Crucifixion involving a crow which represents the film's most unnecessary violence and which even those supporting the film would decry.)No one will leave this film unblamed for Jesus' death. It is no more Sanhedrin determination, nor Pontius Pilate's indecision nor his soldiers' sadism nor Herod's drunken curiosity (the scenes between Jesus and Herod get as close to comic relief as ""The Passion"" allows, and it's not that close) which seals Jesus' fate. Through flashbacks of Jesus' ministry Gibson shows they - and we - are responsible for the suffering Jesus came to endure. (To that end, you wonder if Gibson could not have included a flashback to Jesus' rebuking Peter - ""Get thee behind me, you Satan!"" -  after hearing Jesus announce His death and resurrection.)The showing I attended saw many people leave the screening, waiting in the lobby from the intensity of what they saw and felt. The audience left afterward stunned silent, the only film I'd seen to prompt such reaction. (Gibson shows the Resurrection, earth's happiest day on which Christian faith is built, as a determined moment of mission rather than of celebration, complete with martial music.)No one can leave this film ambivalent about Jesus or His mission. Watching it, seeing his pain and vicariously enduring it, you must either accept Him as Messiah or dismiss Him as a madman. ""The Passion"" was made by dedicated, committed people and will demand the same of anyone, curious to brave enough,  choosing to view it."	5.0	One of the Most Emotionally Moving Films Ever Made	2004-03-01	12	10	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AF8KIUMZGWNFQ	Anthony	Being raised Christian and learning about the Crucifixion was always something that was important to our family. The Passion of the Christ was a beautifully made movie(a least for the first 15 minutes), using Aramaic and great settings, that brought the story to life. Yet, the excessive blood and violence made the Passion something out of a Freddie Kruger movie. The more blood and gore that could be squeezed into every scene was done so. The movie is definitely not for anyone under 10 and will most likely disturb anyone over 10. My suggestion, rent it, it is not something that is worth watching a second time!	2.0	Great portrayal of the crucifixion, but way overdone!	2006-05-02	20	12	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2JI6GJOHVDE76	Anthony	This movie is the best dipiction of Christ's suffering (passion) that I have ever encoutered. The symbalism is carried out through out the whole thing. It is poetic in it's essence. To begin to say that this movie is anti-semetic is to say that the Gospels are not true. I will be the first to stand up and say I drove the nails in myself, for he died for all man kind! The distracting arguements must be stopped and they must begin to focus on what is important. When you begin to watch, i plead with you to open your eyes to the compassion that Christ's face speaks that no words can. I walked out feeling guilty and free at the same time. VERY POWERFUL. Anyone who can walk into that movie as a mocker and a judge and not come out changed, as more than an issue with the movie; they have an issue with Jesus. There were many times when I wanted to stand up and shout out against the voilence thay had put him through, but every second I began to force myself to understand and watch the every detail that the passion put me through. I recommend this movie to the ages of 15 up due to the misunderstanding of suffering that would possibly be recieved. This movie is in my higest regard amazing and complete.	5.0	What is my sacrifice?	2004-02-25	4	4	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1FH14TQSVDH1X	Anthony Sanchez	Alright, I realize that subtlety is not Mel Gibson's strong point.  It could be worse, just imagine if Quentin Tarantino had done this movie instead?  Aside from this issue, the movie seemed to be rather loyal to the gospel stories.  As for the controversy over whether the Jewish religion is insulted, I can't say that there is anything obviously hostile.  The only danger comes from simple readers of the bible who believe that if not for the Jews, Christ would not have died.  I keep reading the bible and see that the death of Christ was part of the plan, not a surprise ending.  At least that part of the story hasn't changed in all of my years of study.  History also shows us that no culture or ethnicity is free of having done sinful harm to their fellow living being.  So hopefully those who would throw stones at the Jews will only come from those who are free from sin.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie.  I would not, however, expose a young child to the movie due to the gore, and that is a real shame.  Rationalize if you will that children see worse in their video games and t.v. shows, but I don't expose my children to those things, so that's my opinion.	4.0	Good, but too much blood.	2004-02-25	5	4	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2UKC6QFG9L5GV	Anton Ilinski	"I never was a religious person. But nevertheless I have to say that ""The Passion of the Christ"" is something. I can't recall when a movie had such an impact on me. It is simply astounding. Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.""The Passion of the Christ"" has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part. Maia Morgenstern (Maria), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate) and especially Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) look like they were born for these roles. I'm utterly impressed and dazed.If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it's the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it's thought-provoking and serious-minded.And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven't noticed any.

After both films, you could have heard a pin drop in those theatres. I guess it took a few minutes for most of us to get our minds around the supreme display of self sacrifice (however dramatized) we had just witnessed. For mature(thinking) audiences only... regardless of your personal politics.The Passion, much like Private Ryan, is not a film I would choose to see a second time. The images, emotions and thoughts are etched into my mind.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A595T15OO91DC	"A. Ort ""aorto"""	I am now several months removed from seeing this film.  Sadly, all that remains is remembrance of the extreme violence.  I remember nothing about the man, nothing about his message, nothing about what he did.  All I remember are the scenes of blood and gore.  That isn't really a judgment as the film was intended to be a no-holds-barred rendering of the final hours of his life.I do remember that the cinematography is phenomenal and the score quite haunting.  As a film, it is powerful.  The film has something of a mystical, other-worldly feel to it and the flashback sequences do provide some grounding (and relief) from the overall achingly somber tone of the film.Without resorting to theological nitpicking, it seems to me that there was little to chew on for those who may not be coming from a Christian backround.  I come from a Christian background and was not enthralled with the film.  I felt as if I should have been deeply moved by the film but, in fact, I generally find myself with the minority opinion among Christian believers.It was appalling violence inflicted upon one man but I simply failed to make the connection within the context of the film for such treatment.  Only my understanding of Christian theology enabled the connection to be made.It is ironic that a film by Gibson, who is from a particularly devout Catholic sect, is praised by evangelical Christians who might otherwise take issue with his Catholicism.  From a hopeful point of view it renders one to conclude that perhaps differing denominations can truly be one body; the cynic says that ultimately we are just opportunists.  But he has put it all out there on the table.  Like him or not, like the film or not, it is kind of hard to ignore.As a film, it is powerful and well worth watching at least once.  I doubt I will watch it again.  As an evangelical or Christian witness tool, it seems to me it has its limits.	4.0	The film about Jesus by which all others will compare...	2004-12-14	17	11	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1YZMGEC9ELI4L	"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www..."	The Man would make history. His life, death and resurrection would rock the world and challenge every man, woman and child for generations to come. His existence had been foretold since the beginning of Time. He would save the world from their sins. He would turn aside the wrath of Almighty God from all those who believed in His name and lived for Him.His name is Jesus Christ. Today, He's alive.But the world killed Him when He came because it did not know Him.Mel Gibson's controversial film about the final 12 hours of the life of Jesus of Nazareth has been met with one of two responses: extreme love or extreme hate. I have yet to meet anyone who was 50/50 about the film.This reviewer loved the film. I make it an annual event to watch it as a personal reminder of what Jesus Christ did for me nearly 2000 years ago.Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth is one filled with love, serenity and, yes, passion. You can see the love of Jesus for all people in his eyes when he speaks. You can see the hurt when he is treated unjustly. If Jim Caviezel did so awesome a job portraying Jesus, one can only imagine the Lord's expression when the events in this film actually happened a couple millennia ago.Based on the Gospels and Roman and Jewish history, Mel Gibson has crafted a well-executed account on what Jesus Christ went through on our behalf.Many complain the film is nothing but sheer gore. Yes, it is bloody, but if you look into Roman history and discovered what Roman scourging and crucifixion entailed, you'd find Gibson's film is bang on. He also made the right choice to display what happened how it happened instead of just putting a few scratch marks on Jesus and a robe splashed with red paint like other films have done. By seeing Jesus murdered as He was, the audience feels the impact of that day long ago. It forces them to pause and reflect.This film serves as a reminder for believers in Jesus, and serves, hopefully, as a touching account of the ultimate sacrifice from the ultimate Love to those who don't believe.It would take a terribly cold heart to not be moved by this film.Very recommended.A.P.

There were times when I almost left.....It didn't have to be that way.......I felt as if I was going to faint sometimes. But it was worth watching and we Catholics should watch it sometimes over the year(not only on Easter)to remind ourselves of all the suffering He went through to save us.And to stop nagging about such small things that happen in our lives.	4.0	Wonderful movie but a little bit on the too violent side....	2004-05-10	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ZS86JN986ANJ	a reader	Mel Gibson's vulgar, gaudy movie depicts just one of the many many thousands of purely imagined god-myths and invented god-in-human-form stories which man is compelled to create and fantasise about. In the movie, `God' Sacrifices Himself to Himself to Save from the Wrath of Himself those Created & Sustained by Himself and who Live & Move & Have their Being Within Himself.Christ is as real as Apollo. God as real as Zeus. This movie and the reactions to it illustrate that Christ belief is merely a product of primal fetishism and primitive obsession, compulsion and fixation. The `Jesus Christ' fantasy is sustained by its power to satisfy: fetishistic fixation on feelings about suffering; the self-centred child's desire for a parent or brother figure to make altruistic sacrifice; the wish to be rescued; guilt, shame, punishment & persecution incantation-loops; emotive empathising with vulnerability; and the ego's drive for immortality.Babies become fixated on an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-perfect parent figure. The result might be rigid 'Christ' & `God' fixation in adulthood.It is coarse and crass thinkers that bought this Jesus drivel wholesale - making a film which compulsively obsesses on the fairy tale's sado-masochistic details (further fantasised into existence by Anne Catherine Emmerich's ludicrously fetishistic book).Bible-zombies and robots-of-Christianity enslave themselves with thought-loops of Jesus-gibberish such as this movie. They ignore the fact that man has always invented gods and goes on doing so. This man-breathed myth is no different from any other products of the human imagination and compulsions to invent god.The plot for this movie derives from a book whose cult is based on superstition, appropriated astro-theologies, plundered pagan elements, and heavily plagiarised deity myths (Osiris, Marduk, Jupiter, Mythra, Attis, Prometheus, Baal, Buddha...). This movie tells the spurious tale of `The Christ' who (so the wish-fantasy goes) is the route to eternal life.  However, when we suffer bio-electrical, bio-physical & bio-chemical brain and body death, it is all over for each and all of us - your life-force, and everyone else's, ends, and eternal life is exposed for the futile fantasy that it is.  When all of mankind is dead `God', `The Lord' etc will cease to be, since the collective mind of humankind is the SOLE LOCUS OF EXISTENCE of 'God' and `Jesus Christ'.[...]	1.0	The Fantasy of `The Christ'	2005-07-21	33	13	20
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ASJ58BBFFW6AF	a reader	"Someone called `Jesus' might or might not have existed but - manifestly - he was not the `Son of God' nor did he `die to save us' (meaningless drivel). As such, this movie's core claim of `the Christ' is bogus and spurious.This movie illustrates religious belief as humankind's most narcissistic enterprise. It's all about self-worship. No one would love Jesus and this film if Jesus were a 300 pound Sumo covered in boils and pimples. People worship themselves by loving an image of `one of us'.'Jesus Christ' is as real as Harry Potter. If you're suckered by this kind of Jebus gibberish, you have an opportunity to self-pleasure your mind. Just keep prattling repetitive fantasy drivel about `He Died to Save us from Our Sins' or `Jesus Christ is Lord' or `Death in Christ is Life' or `The Love of Jesus'. Keep self-stimulating those endorphins and feeding self-righteous blood rushes to the head utilising the inane cultural mechanism created for this purpose: the Bible and `Jesus'.Like its Biblical source book, this movie is kitsch and schmaltz, the coarse and the crass - cloaked in imitation profundity.As everyone is aware, the Jesus Christ figure is merely a man-made symbol (in story/folk tale form) of fatherly-brotherly altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. This myth is utilised to help feed a mental loop of unfulfilled yearnings, guilt and shame. So this movie is built on self-referring, primitive goat-herder stories, wilfully mistaken for something meaningful.The movie's source book of primitive stories depicts fantasy figures called `Jesus' and `God' - invented by humans many centuries ago. It is purely and solely the drives of human culture and the products of neurological phenomena and obsessive thought-loops that produced the Bible. `God' is the product of neurological quirk, fused with ego-driven cultural obsession.To believe the movie's source book as the word of `God' is merely wilfully to fail to recognise its solely human sources: emotional, neurological, cognitive, cultural, sociological. Man's habitual self-deception and delusional pursuit generate religious belief and acceptance of the farrago that is The Bible (`This is The Word of Men').Babies fixate on the all-powerful, all-providing, all-knowing parent figure. This can become mentally fixed and set. The result is rigid, fixated God-belief in adulthood. This spreads like a virus through society, becoming fused into culture.So given both its ancient and contemporary creative sources, it is no surprise that this is a gaudy movie - a blunt instrument - lacking finesse and subtly. It is makes crude appeal to crude emotions and is vulgar in its execution.The Bible is bogus, spurious, and a garish concoction: a crude, blunt, vulgar appeal to amorphous concepts and broad-brush emotions and desires. For example: fear of death, the feeling of being lost and needing rescue, the psyche's desire for immortality, hunger for an upwardly directed relationship.Longings that merely end up as self-comfort mind-loops.If only this movie had been ignored - but it is just too difficult for people to break out of the neurological quirk that is religious belief, embedded and fused into culture as it most surely is. The movie is merely a contemporary manifestation of a relentless tradition of self-deception and delusion - of Bible-swill & God-mush - and desire to spread the mind washing cult-virus that is Christianity.Humans wish to make sense of suffering. For some, `the Christ' on the Cross is a culturally potent man-made symbol of altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. Constructs of sin, fallen man etc all illustrate that Christianity is merely a fabricated construct employed by humankind/people to:- understand their own suffering- come to terms with their own suffering- justify suffering by the person(s) experiencing it- justify suffering by the person(s) inflicting itIf all of humankind were extinguished, so would 'Jesus' and 'God' - since this is their sole locus of existence. Truly it is manifest to all that: on the 7th day, man created God in his own image.Chances are that people who dislike this review will promptly generate ever more fierce and tight circles of endorphin producing self-pleasuring belief thought-loops in order to dismiss it.

I found it totally hideous and offensive to see a portrayal of Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior, cinematically degraded to the level of a pornographic snuff film. No, I did not expect a portrayal of the Crucifixion to be neat or dignified, but I did not expect it to be a horror ride through the ignorance and the superstition of the Bloody Middle Ages either. This is just graphic shock and bloody trauma.This whole movie is an absurd distortion of the descriptions in the Gospels. I cannot believe that anyone equipped with a New Testament could compare the images in this movie with Biblical accuracy. All boundaries of biological, historical, and scriptural realities are broken here. (And WHY are Mary and Mary Magdalene dressed like a pair of 13th Century NUNS?)I reject the satanic symbolism in this movie: a snarling wolfman; demonized children; a writhing maggoty corpse; a satanic baby; a blood thirsty raven--these are the images of a  Hollywood horror flick and have no place in a Christian movie.The one recognizably human moment is when Jesus falls down and Mary runs to comfort her son. That moment felt humanly real. The one recognizable Christian message here is that Jesus did God's Will and died for us, and he showed love and forgiveness even toward his tormentors. But, otherwise, no sane or sacred concept of God or Jesus or humanity had anything to do with this movie.	1.0	Horror ride through the Torture Pit.	2004-10-29	48	23	25

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1YC9XEDFKXPLK	Armando M. Mesa	"After seeing The Passion of The Christ I walked away more of a believer and reflecting upon my own path in my life while saying, ""Look what WE did to him !""...Never did I believed or blamed the Jewish people or the Romans solely responsible for the death of Jesus. Nor did I walk away from the film hating  Jewish people. Utterly ridiculous. Also, those who know the teachings or the bible so well have forgotten that it was a prophecy that even Jesus knew he had to fulfill for humankind... We as a human race(regardless of creed or ethnicity), a collective people crucified him. Further more, I used to think of Jesus only as a divine and spiritual higher power; I had forgotten how human he was also. The Passion of the Christ reaffirmed this... Further more, for someone such as 60 Minutes' commentator Andy Rooney to say that he would never or not subject himself to watching such a violent or gory film while calling Gibson a wacko only shows the magnitude of ignorance he and others share about The Passion of the Christ and Mel Gibson !  Rooney should ask himself if Jesus was okey dokey with subjecting himself to a cruel and horrific death !...Wonder if Gisbon is saying at this point , ""Can't satisfy everyone !""...and that is not the point of this film and obviously his on the recreation of the last twelve hours of Jesus' life. If it is too brutal, too violent, too graphic, then those viewers need to get real ! There is nothing gratuitous,overboard or overblown. I have yet to hear anyone on the contrary say that they have found evidence or proof that the torture Jesus endured was a walk through the park. Also, I'm sure there is some jealousy and resentment amongst the powerful film studio moguls(including those who did not want to touch or back up Gibson's project) who only wished they would have had half the vision and [guts] Mel Gibson possessed in directing The Passion of the Christ! Hats off to Gibson and the casting director for utilizing the gifted talents of international actors and not Hollywood's popular elite. Some may think Mel is ""wacko"" but after all there is a method to his madness or madness to his method that yields brilliant works such as Braveheart and now The Passion of the Christ...The passion for Gisbon's directing and vision surely comes through !Now, the film itself is a masterpiece in technical terms of cinematography, acting, costume and set design, special effects and soundtrack...Regardless if the dialogue was Aramaic or Latin, the subtitles did not hinder at all the action or watching the actors on screen. Nor do they deter the understanding of the story. The imagery varies from simply rich, panoramic, to haunting and nightmarish (involving scenes of the devil or his minions)! The artistic and skillful use of flashbacks to coincide with pivotal scenes (though every scene is practically pivotal) cannot be forgotten. One flashback involving Jesus as a beautiful and angelic curly headed toddler and a young Virgin Mother running to comfort him from a fall will put a knot in anyone's throat.It is one of the most emotional flashbacks regardless if one is a parent or not... The image is strong and will stay in the mind for time to come.I did not view this film in the hopes of being ""entertained"" in the regular or superficial sense of the word. I went to be further ""educated"". I was.Way beyond what I had expected. If you have not seen this film, forget any controversy or preconceived notions.Take any controversy, negative reviews out of the equation, and even forget Mel Gibson directed this for just 2 hours and see the film as it stands on its own...If you can walk away from this film extracting something positive and taken to heart from the viewing experience, and it is an experience(whether spiritual, educational, or other ways) then count yourself amongst the enlightened ones and not those who have become outraged or bittered. Don't become caught up in the controversies and lose sight of what The Passion of the Christ is about; Christ.Just see it !"	5.0	Just See It !	2004-02-29	3	1	2

I went to see this with my wife and we both sat there in awe knowing that this is what Jesus had done for us to pay for our sins. When the movie was over we really couldn't talk. We left the theater quietly and the silence was the same in the car on the way home. I even tried to turn on some beautiful worship music and somehow it seemed shallow. I had to turn the music off. Only quiet would do. This movie was an experience not entertainment. I found myself pondering within myself for days after.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2TNUPM5IJJQVG	"""armstrongsark"""	This is without a doubt the best movie ever made of Christ's sacrifice of love.  It could perhaps have been done better-- unquestionably, the ORIGINAL story is better-- but this film far surpasses any previous attempt to portray the passion of Christ.  If you have read any historical descriptions of the way that beatings and crucifixions were done, there is no reason to claim that this was overdone.  Perhaps the Romans didn't laugh as they beat Him-- but the Bible does say they mocked Him.  And it does say that He couldn't carry His own cross, because of the beating and because of the great amount of blood He had already lost.  If you don't believe the Bible, well, then perhaps you don't believe the sun will rise tomorrow, or that summer will soon be here.  One is as true as the other, because the sun, the seasons, and the Bible all come from the hand of God.  And I believe that Mel Gibson was inspired by God to make this movie, so that no one would have an excuse for not knowing the truth.	5.0	The Most Passionate Love	2004-04-22	9	6	3

McVarish	"Franco Zeffirelli's monumental JESUS of NAZARETH remains most reverent,accurate and ambitious telling of the life of Jesus Christ. With THE PASSION of the CHRIST,however,Director Mel Gibson has brought to the screen the essence of the Christian Mysterium Tremendum:the Logos~Second Hypostasis of the Divinely Revealed Trinity Godhead,incarnated Jesus of Nazareth,abjectly submitting to the most merciless,unjust,brutality conceivable by men under aegis of the most powerful civilization(SPQR)that has ever existed for the sake of LOVE;MERCY;and FORGIVENESS.Gibson's film is neither intended to villify;debate;rebuke norjustify.It's certainly not intended to entertain or ""convert"".Its intention is to AWAKEN world-bedazzled, sullied sensibilities of people(called by HIS NAME)to reality of GODS'S incredible care for His children and the cost REDEMPTION of SIN(not mere crime or politically incorrect ""inappropriate behavior"")demands...C.S.Lewis'The LION,WITCH&the; WARDROBE made this demand clear to  the Pure of Heart.Gibson's film--again and again--staggers jaded,self-satisfied Christians(ALL denominations).

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AX93URVYM33YI	"Arthur Sido ""But who are you, O man, to answe..."	Few films have been as highly touted or as deeply vilified as The Passion of the Christ, and for good reason. In America and the world today, the divide between those who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ and those who haven't has never been clearer. To believers, The Passion is a painful but ultimately moving depiction of the suffering, death and resurrection of their Savior. To non-believers, it is a violent portrayal of a mythical event.The film itself is well made. As remarked previously, the subtitles are not distracting in the least. Most viewers are familiar enough with the story to figure out who Mary is and who Pontius Pilate is. The cinematography is beautiful in most places and the film doesn't drag on. Theologically, I found the film utterly lacking in anti-Semitism and a bit overly Catholic (esp. in relation to Mary), but Gibson is a devout Catholic and this was his dime, so I was able to move past that. The extra-Biblical material did not detract significantly from the Gospel accounts to the point of concern.That leads to the much discussed and maligned violence of the film.It makes sense that the New Testament goes into little detail regarding the actual crucifixion and scourging. No one of that time needed a description as they likely had seen it first hand on many occasions. The reader of that time knew all too well the horrors inflicted by scourging and the agonizing death on a cross. To the genteel viewers of today, accustomed to stylized violence and gore being fed to them via CGI, it WAS absolutely necessary to show the up close and personal violence, inflicted by one person upon another, to really understand the pain that Christ suffered on our behalf. I doubt I will watch this DVD over and over again, but I certainly think that it bears watching again and I will buy it just to spite those who blindly opposed it without ever seeing the movie.I laugh ruefully at those reviewers who sadly try to make light of the Passion with crude humor. Not because they are funny, but because it is so typical of those who do not believe. I don't find it offensive, but I am afraid God will. He will not be mocked, which I suspect will be discovered to the chagrin of the mockers someday. I find it odd that in a world that so values tolerance above any other virtue, mockery of the Savior of the world is still acceptable.	5.0	A masterful work	2004-07-13	5	4	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", while undoubtedly a well-done and stunning movie, is also thinly veiled propaganda for traditionalist Catholicism. It's remarkable that so many evangelicals have expressed support for it. But then, many evangelicals and similar groups co-operate with the Moonie Jonathan Wells. So perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised by their opportunism towards Gibson?The traditionalist Catholic slant of ""The Passion of the Christ"" is obvious in many ways. Some of the situations depicted in the movie aren't found in the Gospels, but in the visions of a Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich. Others seem to be Gibson's own invention, but they are consistent with Catholic tradition, as when Satan mocks the Madonna and the Child. The whole concentration on the violent suffering of Jesus also looks very Catholic. So is the use of the Latin language. Jesus speaks to Pontius Pilate in Latin, although Greek would have been more likely. While Pilate was a Roman, the lingua franca of the East Mediterranean was Greek. There is no indication in the Gospels that Jesus used an interpreter when speaking to Pilate, which suggests that the Gospel writers assumed their conversation to be in Greek (which is also the language of the Gospels themselves.) So why the use of the Latin language? Presumably because Latin is the traditional liturgical language of the Catholic Church. Indeed, much of the conflict between traditionalist Catholics and Vatican II Catholics has been over the use of the traditional Latin mass. I also noticed that the Latin spoken by Pilate and Jesus in the Gibson's movie sounds like Italian! Apparently, ecclesiastical Latin does have an ""Italian"" pronunciation.But the most contentious issue concerning the movie is, of course, the real or perceived anti-Semitism. The Jews of the Sanhedrin certainly look like anti-Semitic stereotypes. Herod Antipas is depicted as an effeminate gay. Also, Pilate is cast in the role of unwilling executioner, as in the Gospel of John, the most anti-Jewish of the four gospels. Of course, it's difficult to make a ""pro-Jewish"" traditional Christian movie about Jesus. Traditional Christianity isn't pro-Jewish, anymore than Orthodox Judaism is pro-Christian. However, Gibson should at least have excised the more blatant stereotypes. That Gibson later made anti-Semitic remarks during the infamous DUI incident, hardly helped his case, despite his public apologies to the Jewish communities.""The Passion of the Christ"" is an artistic achievement as a movie, but due to its problematic contents, I can only give it two stars. Somehow, it feels like a passion for the wrong cause."	2.0	Passion for the wrong cause?	2009-02-06	8	3	5

I know the Stations of the Cross as well as anyone who grew up Catholic, and I know the Gospels as well any Baptist. However, like Chicago Sun-Times movie critic Roger Ebert, I was connected with the reality of the suffering Christ went through in a very real way. It is just a movie, and the guy on the cross wasn't Jesus. But it caused me to think about Jesus in a whole new way.I knew this was coming. I have read dozens of articles on this and tuned into every show on the movie. Not good enough. It still hit me. It wasn't the blood that spattered on my face, but the love that spattered on my heart. I sat in that theater as a Christian who believes, but I experienced something very heavy that evening. There is no separating my Christian beliefs from my reaction to the movie.The subtitles take nothing from the experience, and add to the focus on the movie's story rather its dialogue.The beginning sets the dramatic tone, delivering us into the Garden of Gesthemene as Jesus prays. Judas kisses him softly on the cheek, and a fight ensues between the posse of soldiers and Jesus' disciples. Jesus himself waits, and even heals the ear wounded by Peter, whom Jesus rebukes. The following events include a trial and flogging. Jesus never raises a hand or comment against his accusers, nor does he deny their accusations that he claims to be God. Pilate is torn politically, wanting to do the right thing and wanting to save his own position. Unwilling to assert a position, he lays the call onto the town's citizen who are in a blood-frenzy.What grabbed me in the movie were unexpected scenes, like Jesus and Mary connecting sight on the Via Dolorosa. Jesus stumbles, and the movie flashes back to Mary running to a four year old Jesus who stumbled in a field. She picks him up, holds him motherly. Now, Jesus is 33, all battered and worn from a vicious, sadistic abuse by Roman soldiers. Mary runs to him. He speaks to her, whispering cryptically, ""See mother, I make all things new,"" and does his best to press on. It is his cross to carry, and he raises to his feet.The ending is ingeniously subtle. In some ways, they are the 30 most important seconds of the movie in which it all comes together. Every drop of blood, every rejected silver piece, and every cross-dragged furrow in the road to Golgotha comes together in probably the most understated yet complete climax to a movie I have ever seen.I understand now why people bought tickets for friends, dragged people to see it. I expected to be blown away, but I didn't expect to be hit at my core on so many different levels.The movie isn't perfect. Some scenes took more poetic license than can be historically supported. Herod was decadently different than I expected, and perhaps the least like the real Herod. Herod's lascivious persona here matches the essence, if not the exact personality. His reactions to the Christ situation were consistent with the Bible, and add texture to Pilate's dilemma.Some vague scenes confused me, like when Satan carries a grimacing, sneering man-child. However, as Satan's gender is not important to his evil nature, the androgyny holds up.A knowledge of Christian scripture will augment an understanding of the film's secondary flashback scenes. The movie does stand on its own, and meets the vision of its controversial director. Whether the audience is a devout believer, or seeing the movie as an artistic portrayal of history's most influential figure, the movie will work. I expect it to be rerun in theaters every Easter season.I fully recommend this movie.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"	5.0	Cataclysmic, Profound Movie Bigger Than Controversy	2004-03-08	23	17	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1PASRZ81DY9C	Austin Somlo	Viewed: 5/14Rate: 15/14: The Passion of the Christ garnered a lot of attention in 2004, but I didn't get caught up in the hype or follow it for the slightest bit. Fast forward to ten years later, I was browsing through the library's shelf of movies that might strike my interest, and I saw The Passion of the Christ sitting there. So, I figured that I might give it a try. And I now wish that I never did and have regretted it. The thing with me, I don't watch movies made after the year of 2000 because almost everything I've seen thus far does not resemble good cinema in any shape, form, or manner. So, I gave up and declared that I'll only watch movies made before the end of the year 2000. There is a strong reason in my declaration, and The Passion of the Christ reaffirms my stance. The film brings out the worst of everything. It's the fake acting. It's the constant overt melodrama in everything that the characters do, feel, think, or speak. It's the free-all ultra-graphic torture. It's the unrealistic depiction of what a human being is capable of. It's the impossibility of physics. It's the unmerciful pacing that moves slow like molasses in January. It's the vapid storyline that seems to convey nothing of substance or significance. Truly, The Passion of the Christ is a waste of my time. By the way, I saw Braveheart and thought of it a terrific entertainment, and thenceforth, I was so annoyed by the many borrowed techniques from it into The Passion of the Christ. All in all, what I saw and felt is The Passion of the Torture on both sides: mine and the film's.	1.0	A Ridiculous Waste of My Time.	2014-05-17	8	1	7

As well, I didn't find it nearly as gory as I thought it would be.  It is Roman soldiers who cane Jesus, who scourge him, who beat him, insult him, spit on him, press a crown of thorns onto his head and crucify him, all on the orders of a Roman procurator. And nobody in their right mind would ever accuse the film of being anti-Italian, just as I have never heard anyone accusing, say, Schindler's List of being anti-German.There were no 'surprises' since this is an old story that people already know  - Jesus is arrested, accused, not necessarily found guilty but sentenced by the people anyhow, beaten, then given a cross to drag up a hill where he is to be crucified. Once there he is nailed to the cross, and shortly thereafter, he dies. His body is taken down, put in a mausoleum, and the next morning, he is risen. End of story.

Cruelty shown in this movie would damage their psyche.Since this movie was devoted to the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, I was surprised that it didn't mentioned Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Jew (and a secret disciple of Jesus) who begged Pontius Pilate to release Jesus' body to him for proper burial after his death.  It was Joseph of Arimathea who wrapped Jesus' body in the finest cloth and laid him in his own family's tomb, a man-made cave in his garden.  The subsequent resurrection of Jesus from this cave became the beginning of Christianity.The entire film is spoken in foreign language (Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew) with English subtitle, which I thought the actors did very well.In the end, I didn't understand the purpose of this movie.  Very disappointed - especially since the DVD didn't even have special features of how the movie was made.(For those people who are interested in how Jesus spent his last hours without the Hollywood drama, I recommend Discovery Channel's ""Who was Jesus?""  It's a historical study of Jesus through the eyes of a historian, archaeologist and theologian.  You even get to see what Jesus may have looked like from the skeletal remains from that time.)"	1.0	Lost in blood and spit	2014-02-24	12	3	9
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2DYGO40HTQBMQ	Avid	"Passion of the Christ is a movie without doubt superb!As an agnostic (raised Catholic), I see the story told on screen for what it is - a dynamic story of a man in emotional turmoil and physical distress. The acting is superb, the writing is superb, the storyline is superb, the directing is superb. The movie as a story is superb, regardless of the subtitles.Christian believer or Jewish scholar, the storyline portrays the last hours of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, which foretells the basis of Christian belief: Christ dying on the Cross for the sins of Man and being resurected.Contrary to the Bolshevik nay-sayers of Hollywood, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is NOT anti-semitic any more than it is anti-Roman (Italian). It is an extremely well told story from the New Testement, given the facts as we know them. There were only two major portrayals in the movie, Jews and Romans. What is shown is not one side against another, but rather the issues of the complex socio-political-economic times. Christ and his disiples were, after all, Jews in a Jewish environment, ruled by Romans.Don't see this movie as an affirmation of faith, or as a racist, anti-Jewish story, but as a historical story of a time and place where bad things happened. If anyone comes away with a different, possibly more positive, point of view, so much the better.Whatever the view, this should not detract from the Judeo-Christian Canon of the Old and New Testament Bible."	5.0	A Story Supebly Told	2004-08-28	3	2	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A55MRYPUAX4QU	Avid Reader	"I have finally seen the Passion after reading the bashings in the NY Times, reviewing the harsh criticism and hearing the war of words for all these months.  It was not an anti-Semitic blood feast nor did I feel it necessarily celebrated violence for violence sake. It was violent, that is true, but in Gibson (and the audience's) mind, it was not mindless nor gratuitous, but an essential (maybe THE essential) aspect of the story.  It was, more than anything, a cinematic - not a spiritual - experience.  I might add, I have enjoyed Mel Gibson in almost every movie he has ever starred.This was as personal a story as one can get in that every nuance, thought and word was conceived in Gibson's mind - the Bible was only a prop. As he said, this is NOT the life of Jesus but the story of the Passion, those last days of his life.  The idea of using Aramaic and Latin was stunning but somehow ""right"". (By the way, if he had wanted to be historically accurate he would have used Aramaic and Greek - almost no Roman citizens spoke Latin in their daily life.)This is a pre-Vatican II Christ, the Savior of power and majesty who dies for the sins of us all. It overlooks the contradictory Gospel tales, papering over the obvious problems one encounters trying to reconcile the many stories that have come down to us from oral then written form.  Gibson did not follow any one of the versions rigidly but instead created his own, a distillation of Catholic, Bibical and historical traditions.This is also the story of Gibson's own journey from believer to wayward sinner and back to the fold, much as he did in SIGNS. The score was particularly effective and even if one does not share the supernatural aspects of the story, it is powerful and wrenching. An amazing accomplishment on both the personal and artistic levels."	5.0	The Gospel of Christ by Mel Gibson	2004-09-07	10	8	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AW3A3VQDI1AJW	A. Vivolo	With out a doubt this is the best portrayal of the last hours of Jesus on earth. It is passionate, realistic and overwhelming. It will move you to tears. The greatest story ever told has never been told this greatly. The act of Christ giving His life to save us from ourselves is brilliantly portrayed. It is an excellent synthesis of the four gospels that demonstrates nearly all aspects of his trial and execution. Some of the other people around Jesus are also very well depicted, from His mother to Peter to Judas Iscariot. This gives the film a very &quot;whole&quot; feeling. Truely a wonder!!!A note to address the extremely negative reviews: Please don't let them persuade you into missing this brilliant film. Of the negative reviews that I have read, they are extremely inaccurate in how they portrayed the movie. If you are concerened about the violence in the movie please keep in mind that the vast majority of it happened at Christ's scourging...a scene easily fast forwarded through. As for the claims that the scourging is scene is unrealistic, just remember that the Roman empire was extremely good at torturing and executing people. They had hundreds of years to practice and perfect their art of butchery.	5.0	The Best Ever	2004-08-03	16	10	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A36RRLVEBABY5Z	"Axel Law ""The Happy Seizure Kid"""	"Ah, finally!  Another review by me!  How bout that?  Been quite a long time since I've written a review for Amazon.com, and finally I've written something that will rock with your head and eat your soul like my others.  Here's a review I've put off writing for quite awhile because I really wanted to wait for the hype to die down.  And after reading so many different viewpoints on this website and others, it's caused quite a stir indeed.  Well, here we go.The film largely follows that of the catholic faith's ""Stations of the Cross"" and while I'm not too entirely familiar with it, I know that it details the ""passion"" (literally meaning ""suffering"") of Jesus Christ and finally being nailed on the cross.  Mel Gibson himself is catholic and had this idea incubating in his head for years and I'll tell you what, this film really got to me.  It's wondrous cinematography (remember the film The Black Stallion?  Same guy!), authentic languages of Aramaic and Latin (which by the way, Aramaic was used by the common people, Latin by the Romans.  Just thought you'd find that interesting.), and the wonderful performances by everyone involved, especially Jim Caviezel as Jesus.  I previously saw him in ""Frequency"" and already knew he was a good actor, but this movie proved that he is indeed a GREAT actor.  Monica Bellucci, who played in the Matrix films and played a whore in that stupid ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" film, is Mary Magdalene here and also turns in a fine performance here.Gibson actually did some nice artistic touches here, especially with the flashbacks.  I think this is where some Christians get pissed off because he took a few liberties.  Example: in the Bible when Jesus is tempted in the Garden of Gethsemane, we see Satan (presumably) tempting him to not fulfill the prophecy.  While the Bible never outright says it is Satan, I found it very plausible.  Satan is regarded as the evil spirit, or the fallen angel, who tempts us through sin.  It would seem very likely to me that Satan wouldn't want Jesus to die for us.  Gibson also used the ""original sin"" idea, showing Satan with the ugly baby, and also with Judas being shameful and eventually killing himself for what he had done.My only complaint with this is I wanted to see a little more to the resurrection than we saw.  I wanted to see everyone's faces when they would see Jesus alive and well.  Oh well, I guess.  After all, no matter how well you make a religious film, it can't be perfect (and plus, that wasn't really the focus of this film).So why did it affect me like it did?  Well, I may be the strong religious person that I am (and loves heavy metal, how about that?), but in growing up in the Protestant faith, I never really concentrated on Jesus' suffering; after all, without the resurrection, it would've been a moot point.  However, when watching the film, all I could really think of was ""He did THAT for me?""  I never really thought about what he went through, and this film changed my thinking forever.  I'm not sure if I would outright tell you to see this movie because it's very graphic and poignant; however, if you do, I HIGHLY suggest you watch it with an open mind because I've known people to hate it just because of their opinions on what the Bible is and so forth.  If you don't like the film because of its graphic nature, then you are well in your right.  If you don't like it based on your preconceptions of what Jesus went through or it disagrees with your religious opinion (for example, I have a friend who didn't like it just because he thought Jesus was totally human and not spiritually the ""Son of God"" and therefore could not live during the crucifixion.), then that is simply your opinion but I still can't help but feel like you are allowing those preconceptions to override the fact that this is indeed just a film, and the filmmaker is showing his deepest love for Christ.It's not a film for everybody to enjoy and even I find it hard to enjoy as entertainment.  But it quite possibly might have been the most influential film I've ever seen in my life.  While my faith first and foremost comes from the Scriptures, this film still makes a profound impact for me and you have to respect Mel Gibson for doing what he did."	5.0	Quite possibly the most moving religious film of our time.	2004-12-03	10	4	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ACOO1NZKALM44	AzureBlu	I have a very close relationship to Jesus and the faith I have in him is very strong. I've struggled throughout my life physically going in and out of hospitals with surgeries and procedures. Through this, I've always felt that Christ was always near me in my most trying times as a young child to my adult years. He's never given up on me and I'll never give up on him.When I first heard of the movie, I was curious to see how Mel Gibson would portray it. When it was finally released, part of me wanted to see it while the other part didn't. In a way, I felt I had to because in a way, I was there with him through *his* most trying times in his life. He was there for me when I was struggling, and by me watching him I was there for him. I was glad I saw it, but I will most likely never see it again. Once is enough for me. :)I really do recommend people see this. Not only as a religious point of view, but as a learning experience for all.	5.0	It's A Must See	2005-07-05	6	2	4

As an unorthodox Christian myself, on the one hand, you could say this was a stark, innovative movie about the final hours of arguably the most important man in our history. On the other, you could say what on earth was Gibson thinking? I nearly came to blows with a born-again ""Christian"" colleague because I said this was exploitative garbage. Prior to this film, he and his chums had only Cliff Richard to fly the flag, so they were desperate for someone to notice them. Unless all the actors did it for free and every penny was donated to charity, this is blasphemous exploitation. After having been assaulted by the awful ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"", the only thing that really surprised me was that Gibson didn't have the Jews and Romans speaking with perfect English accents, with  Jim Caveziel Riverdancing to the cross in an Irish brogue and half his face painted blue, whilst waving the Stars and Stripes.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AHKOPVTQ3IEBL	"Baltic Books ""Vic"""	"See the movie!  Buy the DVD.Okay everyone.  We finally went to see the controversial Mel Gibson portrayal of the last day of Jesus life (the events of that day are commonly called ""The Passion"").Here are some of my thoughts:* Not nearly as violent as Saving Private Ryan, or any number of other movies featuring cinematic ""realism"" today.  Having said that, there is no way around it, this is a violent film, but I don't think an NC-17 is justified in this case as suggested by some film critics.The thing is, for hundreds of years the death of Christ as occurring in a crucifixion has been so sterilized that people (I'm talking to Christians mostly) attribute a kind of Santa Claus or Easter Bunny mythology to what Jesus went through.  This portrays the crucifixion accurately from a realistic standpoint verified by the Journal of the American Medical Association. (The Journal of the American Medical Association, March 21, 1986, Volume 256).* Accurate to the biographical record written by two eye witnesses to Jesus-- Matthew and John; and one historian-- Luke, and the record probably dictated to Mark by Peter.  The film is based on these historical records, commonly called the Gospels. From my viewpoint as a guy with a degree in Bible and Theology, they closely follow the events.Obviously there is some cinematic license taken to make an interesting screenplay, but even in those moments I felt the film was true to the spirit of the records.* Anti-Semitic?  I don't think so. There were several criticisms leveled against the film.  One was that Jews were always shown in a poor light.  That is not true. While the key leaders that brought Jesus to trial were accusing him and probably inciting their people in order to get a death sentence, it is accurate to the biographical record.Having said that, it is most important to note: Outside of the Roman occupiers of Jerusalem, every person portrayed was a Jew.  At no time did Jesus or any of his followers call for any kind of judgment against the Jewish leadership.  Plus, at least two of the Jewish leaders were clearly shown to support Jesus.  Additionally, Jesus was a Jew, as was his mother, all his followers and every person supporting and sympathizing with him.Following the crucifixion the Bible clearly shows his followers stayed active in the local Jerusalem temple. (cf: Acts 2; Acts 3). They remained Jewish, and actively maintained their temple worship for at least several years. To say the film is anti-Semite is to say it calls judgment on Jesus followers.* ""His blood be on us and our children"" is a famous line in the gospels and critics cry out that this line alone is enough to incite violence against Jews. However it does not appear in the current film version (unless it is an untranslated line in Aramaic or Hebrew).  This line is one of the great and beautiful ironies of the gospels. Matthew 27:24-26 presents these words as the crowd calls for Jesus crucifixion. The irony is while it seems that people-leaders are reckless calling a curse or judgment on themselves for Jesus death, the truth is that is exactly what allows all people to enjoy the extended forgiveness and favor with God. The Bible clearly teaches it is Jesus blood that is the means to forgiveness.  The blood is the vehicle of mercy, not judgment.* Jon Voight incorrectly cites film techniques employed by Nazi's in the 1930s.  Actor and director, Jon Voight this week on CNBC and MSNBC implied that Gibson used techniques designed to vilify Jews. He stated frames of Jews were interspersed with frames of demonic figures, suggesting these are a means to demonify Jews.Voight needs to see the film again and take another look.  The instances where this took place were as Judas was in the process of his betrayal subsequently overwrought with the guilt of his actions.  He was clearly demonized (rightly so) and some images were clearly hallucinated. In another scene you see a demonic figure with the satan-character.  You never one time see a demonic figure linked to any Jewish leader or person of any prominence.* You should read the biographies (gospels) of Jesus life before seeing this film-- or certainly after you see it. The film can stand for itself as a piece of cinematic art, however it assumes you are very familiar with the history of Jesus life, and hopefully the prophetic Jewish writings of the Old Testament that are a setting for the coming of a ""Messiah"" that would save all people from sins. Each biography presents the life of Jesus from a different viewpoint. However, if you do not have any background in the Bible, you might want to read a ""synoptic"" version--one that has incorporated all four biographies into one chronological record also called a ""harmony of the gospels"".A free copy of one of these is available online called the ""Book of Hope"". Do a Yahoo search to find the page.OTHER RESOURCES YOU SHOULD LOOK AT* The Book of Hope (Free mailed to you-the gospels in harmonized, chronological order)* ""On the Physical Death of Christ"" (JAMA article on the crucifixion)* The Jesus Film (purchase it--most accurate & complete film on Jesus life made to date)* Watch the Jesus Film via streaming video online (no charge at JesusFilm.com- 60 languages)"	5.0	True to the facts and spirit of the biographies	2004-03-12	12	9	3

It is superbly shot, the cinematography literally breath-taking in its intensity and ability to add muscular heft to the familiar story of how Jesus came to fulfill the prophecy through his divine sacrifice on behalf of all mankind. The movie-goer is sure to be transformed by the magnitude of the oft-told and retold tale of how the events of the final twelve hours focused on the ways in which Jesus deliberately serves himself up as the sacrificial lamb for the manifest sins of the world, offering all humans the opportunity to re-establish their contact with the divine from whom they had been estranged.Indeed, I found myself almost speechless after viewing the film, and was not quite sure to what extent it was a result of the power of the film's message as opposed to the graphically violent context in which the tale is told. Herein lies the single criticism one can level against the film, which despite many worries from bystanders that it was laced with virulent anti-Semitism, seems to clearly blame all sinners (ergo, all of us) for the sacrifice of God's son on the cross. Yet Mel Gibson's sure hand is both able and accurate, and the violence shows how carnal man greets the divine, and how we react to the message of hope and salvation; through unspeakable cruelty and gratuitous violence. So, while this is indeed a very violent movie, the murderous acts depicted quite graphically have to be taken in the context of the supernatural events transpiring, as a kind of carnal counterpoint to the ethereal repose with which Jesus bears all of the acts visited upon him. At one point He tells Mary (After he has stumbled under the burden of the cross) &quot;Behold, mother, I make all thing anew!"" This was, for me at least, a quite stunning reminder of the godly forces at work amidst all the violence and carnage.This is a very personal interpretation of the final twelve hours of Christ's life on earth leading to His crucifixition. From the moment it opens in the solitude of the Garden at Gethsemane, one is immediately aware of the battle ongoing between good and evil, as the devil (cleverly presented as a stunning if malevolent woman with a masculine voice) attempts to dissuade Jesus from attempting what he about to undertake. From this it is obvious He is doing this for all mankind, Jews and Gentiles alike, and that we are all to blame, through our unremitting addiction to carnality and sinfulness, for the evil manifested in the world. This is a fantastic film, one that is definitely not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, and definitely not something I would suggest subjecting a child to. Still, it is a remarkable work, and one that deserves the very wide distribution it is about to encounter."	5.0	Superb, Albeit Quite Violent Portrayal Of Jesus' Passion	2004-02-25	207	177	30

On the one hand there are the faithful believers who rever him as the Son Of God & people who think he was merely a man who the Bible and the Church made a diety of in order to scare people into embracing their beliefs with half-witted ""prophecies"" of hellfire & brimstone.THE PASSION OF CHRIST is the third feature to be Directed by Mel Gibson, in fact the film was a sheer labor of love for him as he also co-produced & co-wrote the film (which is in Gaelic & Aramaic with English subtitles).THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST focuses on Jesus's last hours on Earth, from the Garden Of Gethsemane, the Last Supper, Christ's betrayal by Judas, Peter's denial of him through to extensive scenes of his trial for blasphemy and crucifixion (which makes up a good portion of the film). Jim Cavizel (billed as James here), best known for his roles in movies such as FREQUENCY & THE THIN RED LINE gives the performance of his career as Jesus. There's only one problem; and for me this really blunted the full impact of the film somewhat: for two hours I saw Jim Caviezel, the actor; PLAYING Jesus Christ.Depending on your beliefs you will either love or despise this movie. I thought it was good but I found it kind of sick how people can only enter heaven by worshipping Christ, ""God's Only Son"". I found it especially interesting after reading Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" last year, and seeing that the book HUMANISED Jesus. Interestingly, it's alleged the church covered up evidence Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a daughter named Sarah. Apparently the myth of Magdalene being a prostitute may have been the result of a smear campaign by the Catholic Church; and that in actuality Christ had blood descendants. Not a good image for the Son Of God, is it? But wait, when I was a Catholic as a child I was told we were ALL God's children! How about some common sense? How about THE TRUTH!In all fairness, I actually quite liked the movie. There are good performances, the film is beautifully shot and also THE PASSION OF CHRIST is truly a ground breaking film. I think this may be the first Christian exploitation movie! And boy, is it bloody! This is the first film to show the crucifixion as the disgusting spectacle it was. We see Jesus be bloodily whipped with barbs & having a crown of thorns nailed to his head (after Pilate spares a raving lunatic from crucifixion in favor of Christ, which I considered rather odd), Christ being forced to carry his cross up the Mount, falling several times along the way, being aided by Simon Of Cyrene and having blood cleaned from his face by Veronica. It's all very vividly created but all the film did was further reinforce my reasons for lapsing from the Catholic faith. What God would do this to his own son? Not MY idea of God. My God has a sense of humor (In fact there IS a scene here where Jesus displays humor when he is making a table & talking to his mother. Where's the humor in the Bible?)Also, I could not write this review without pointing out one of the biggest ironies in the history of NZ's censorship laws I have EVER come across. SPCS, the people who are still trying to ban BAISE MOI & VISITOR Q (Their motto should be ""If at first you don't succeed: Fail, Fail & Fail again"") are lobbying to have the films R16 rating in NZ LOWERED so 13-15 year olds can see it with a parent! Because this is JESUS! The violence is JUSTIFIED! Not only that; but how can that classification be ENFORCED? It's beyond a joke & especially ironic considering this co-stars Monica Bellucci of IRREVERSIBLE! (NZ seems to be the only country in the western world where IRREVERSIBLE is not getting a DVD release! So I legally can't buy it! I love NZ).So I'll finish off my review with a question: Why is it supposedly OK according to SPCS for kids to see this (Personally I think the movie would give them nightmares) but, as I've said before adults can't watch what they choose of their own free will? A classic example of the pot calling the kettle black, if you ask me.How much you enjoy (""enjoy"" being a loose term here given the movie's gruesome subject matter) THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST boils down to your personal belief system, and will be interpreted and discussed in countless different ways. In a nutshell though, three star review aside; this really is a movie you should see for yourself, regardless of your religious beliefs: Christian, Jew, Muslim, atheist, agnostic it doesn't matter.

It sucks your soul dry and fills you with despair.  It says that we humans are worthless, despicable creatures who delight more in the suffering of one historical figure -- than in paying attention to this man's message.In other words, it's entirely about Jesus torture and nothing at all about his best message:  Love each other.A real shame, this is.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest, I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another, and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here, hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated.	5.0	touching	2009-07-21	1	0	1

This movie helped trigger a conversation that helped re-inforce my belief in Jesus Christ as our savior. It helped to make me realize that I can admit I am a sinner and that I need to be saved by Jesus to enter into heaven someday. I think this movie helped put emotion behind the story of Jesus. Hopefully it helps others believe more strongly in Jesus. Watch it and see. You never know how it might make you feel. Even if there's only a slight chance that Jesus really did go through this torture for us, it would help to try to believe, just in case! Hell for eternity would be awful. I want to go to heaven.

It made me, literally, cry like a child, but the message really hit home. No Gospel reading and no meditation had ever brought the reality, the brutal physicality of what happened in those twelve hours so vividly close to me.One reads about suffering, and violence, and humiliation, and builds a picture of it within himself which is forcibly limited to the experiences of violence and suffering that he could himself observe, or imagine.But this film is different. This is ""being there"". This is the violence of the nailing, or the unbearable brutality of the scourging, as vividly represented as I could never have imagined it myself, because of the lack of the most elementary experiential frame. Not even with my imagination had I been able to correctly understand the sheer atrocity of the events.I discovered that I had been able to read about, to vaguely imagine, but not to really feel what does it mean to be scourged, or to be nailed to a cross.Therefore, the violence is not useless; on the contrary, it is an indispensable instrument to the true understanding of those events, the more so because our society is, thankfully, so far away from such levels of violence. It is not a Hollywood gimmick, but a learning instrument. It is not there to awaken your worst instincts, but your best ones.I cannot know, and it is difficult for me to judge, what effect this movie might have on a non-Christian, though I can well imagine that for some of them, this film might be life-changing.But I feel pretty sure that the impact on sincere believers will continue to be very powerful in the decades to come."	5.0	Did not want to see it.

He's your typical left wing smear merchant who flood amazon's reviews and slam Christians and President Bush. So, disregard all the 1 star reviews by the left wing loons and read this. They provide no evidence and only throw out labels and name's. A typical Left Wing Tactic.This movie is as close as a movie has ever been made to what really happened to Jesus Christ. The movie is good. I say anyone at the age of puberty should see it. It's true, straight from the Gospels and some of the Old Testament, with some info from the Catholic Church to give it some more story which probably did happen or was consistant with what did happen.Now for my 2 gripes...Jesus was nailed through the wrist, not the hands. I figured that Mel Gibson would have got that right with all the research he did. My second gripe is for all the 2 hours of blood and gore, which was necessary, there is no reward at the end. It just ends abruptly. There should have been a bit more, or a prequel and a sequel. Watching this film one would learn nothing about Jesus except he was crucified. You need to go in with some knowledge of History regarding God.So, it's a must see, right along with 'Jesus' starring Jeremy Sisto, which is to this day the best account and up to date movie about Jesus life.Oh, and this movie grossed 10 times more than it should have thanks to the left wing media slamming it left and left.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A23BH24MXOPUZU	Ben	The movie itself is beautifully filmed. The acting is quite good and as a history freak I found it interesting to hear Latin and Aramaic. I did not find it anti-semitic, but then I can understand why Jewish folk might be suspicious, given the beliefs espoused by Gibsons' family, and never actually disavowed by Gibson himself.I am not a Christian, so it struck me as odd that Christians would like this film from a theological standpoint. Perhaps I am just not getting it. I always understood that the most central point of the Jesus story was that he arose from the dead, not that he was tortured to death. So it suprises me that the film would concentrate almost entirely on this one aspect of the story, rather than on the resurrection part. That it does not, smacks of violence-as-a-marketing-tool to me. When all the hoopla has died down, it will be interesting to see how much money Gibson will have made off of the suffering of his savior.I have to say that I am more than a little shocked at the fawning tone I have seen in these reviews, particularly from Christians. The enthusiastic way in which they are taking joy in watching someone being slowly tortured to death is sickening; and exactly the same sort of bloodthirsty eagerness that the ancient Romans displayed when they watched animals and people (including Christians) being executed in the arena. The fact that there is a religious purpose to the film does not excuse this. I wonder if this movie were made with the exact same types of scenes, but without the religious content, how many of reviewers would still sing its praises. I guess Jesus' message has not really changed the human heart, eh? Shame on all of you.If you don't think about the movie's religious implcations and view it as a horror flick in period costume, the movie comes off just fine. However I suspect that this was not Gibson's intent.Not being a slasher movie fan, I probably won't see this movie again. Or even bother renting it, much less buying it. But if you are a modern day Savonarola, and believe that pain and suffering is the most important aspect of your religion, you will get off on this film.	1.0	Hypocritical and blasphemous.	2007-04-01	52	9	43

I let the whole religion thing kind of blow over and took it from a more historic point.The acting is beyond Oscar worthy, as is the directing, score, cinematography, and sound.I don't predict too many nods for this film because of the incredible difficulty in watching and digesting all that is thrown at the view in the 2 1/2ish hours that this film comes in at.DEFINATELY NOT FOR THE WEAK AT HEART OR STOMACH as the gore is extremely intense and disturbing. But the scenic view that this film is shot through may be some of the best ever. We left the theatres and we were (among the hundreds with us) completely speechless. Not since Schindler's List has this happened. Take this movie how you will. I'm not going to go a preaching rampage about accuracy and the tride and truth that it did any religion, but is overall a truly sensational and extremely powerful film. Just take my review as that. I will take this film as a piece of indesribable cinematography and I think that using not so popular actors was a wise move by director Gibson as it makes it more realistic because we are not so quick so say ""wasn't he/she in that old stupid movie""Essentially, see it, but with this is mind... whether or not it is ""the power of christ that compels you"""	5.0	Passion - Sensational, Disturbing, Emotional, Haunting	2004-02-25	2	2	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	This is a jarring, violent, uncomfortable film, depicting the last, horrible hours in the life of Jesus as a deluge of suffering and sacrifice. I am not religious, and I don't agree with several of director Mel Gibson's political stances. But THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a brave, risky, harsh film that knows exactly what it's trying to do and does it well. It doesn't look away from the harsher aspects of its violence, for it's trying so desperately to communicate the feelings of pain and grief to its audience and move them. In the midst of Jesus's long walk to the cross, at one point, Mary is shown weeping for her son, thinking of him as a boy. That moment in the film, where Jesus is shown at his most human, is, for me, when it's most touching. Like SCHINDLER'S LIST before it, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is not at all fun and may be too difficult to watch more than once, but it's a tremendously effective, smart piece of cinema.	5.0	Violent, but thought-provoking.	2004-12-28	16	9	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1UEW7L44EOXYA	benjamin morris	Wow, what a experience.  People had told me I would love this movie and they were not wrong, I cried as if I were a wee little school girl.B8t after all was said and done, and this is in no way undermining the incredible job that Mel Gibson did on this film, I was left with an almost empty feeling...and it didn't take me long to realize why.  It needed more violence.  Sure, Jesus ribs and elbow bone are exposed and there isn't an inch of his body without gashes on it, but there were some key moments were extra violence could have been added. For instance, when he falls to his knees and Mary thinks of him as a child, and runs to him whispering gently, I am here ...what was the point of that? It did nothing but take away from the extraordinary violence taking place.  Another scene has Mary Magdalan being stoned, but all we saw was Jesus feet and her face  (with only a little bit of blood on it!)  I would have reall yloved to see her getting pelted with rocks and potatoes.  Personally I think the actors who play the roman guards should be up for best supporting actors, as every moment of their pereformance makes you question your own soul.  I do have to say that the spikes being driven into his palms and feet is an exquisite piece of film making. Over all a great film, but Mel could have gone that extra mile to make it a little more violent.	4.0	Changed Forever	2004-03-18	21	0	21

I cannot think of many superior cinemagraphic experiences than viewing ""The Passion of the Chirst.""  With the soldiers and the Pharisees, it is nearly unfathomable that such hate could be conjured up for one's fellow human beings but there are endless reminders around us today which document that such hate still exists.  Christ in particular remains despised in numerous hearts and locales.The artistic merits of ""The Passion..."" are weighty.  Merely hearing Aramaic and Latin for two hours straight is valuable in itself.  All of the acting is strong and this is even true of the minor roles as one's outrage at the individual soldiers is palpable.The choice for Satan was fascinating as I don't recall ever seeing a more perfectly androgynous human being captured on the big screen.  The way that Mel Gibson ""fleshed out"" Pilate was stupendous, and quite surprising.  In the context of the times, it is possible to feel sympathy for him.  The very small things are what makes the film uniquely memorable, such as the use of flashbacks, the motif of the dove, and the death scene of Judas.

I watch alot of true story movies and this was not one of those movies. There is no way that ANYBODY could survive the whipping he took, and IF they did they would not be concious especially not concious enough to carry a big wooden cross as far as he did. I hate when people pick movies apart but this movie was so full of holes it was realisticaly pathetic. I guess it was so ultra sappy it was just hard to stay interested, Mel could have done more to draw in the non-church going crowd. Mel Gibson is a gifted director, but this movie was biting too much on Braveheart's success and it showed all through out the film. I would think after seeing this movie people would be even more skeptical of the events that supposedly took place at that point in history because I already was a skeptic and now this whole Jesus phenomena is all the more laughable.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AEBOD21JROJ4G	"Bighairydoofus ""-"""	"One thing I want to say first off:  THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR KIDS!When I went to see this film, I was shocked to find that there were many young children in the audience.  I don't care what your minister says, allowing anyone under thirteen years of age to see this film is WRONG.  It's an incredibly brutal and violent film and there are many alternatives if you want young people to see a movie about the crucifixion of Christ.  I know that kids these days get exposed to lots of violent movies, TV shows and video games, but if you're even thinking of letting your child see this watch it first by yourself, then decide.Now that I have that over with, on with the review of the DVD.  Mel Gibson made a technically brilliant film, from the costumes, sets, languages and the like, but he didn't take a great deal of risks with this movie.  The film is beautifully shot, but the characters take a back seat to the unrelenting violence.  The depiction of Satan is particularly one dimensional, with virtually no interaction with Jesus except for a brief exchange relatively early in the film.  The rest of the time, the devil skulks around looking very creepy and sinister, but ultimately comes off as a spooky but ineffectual piece of background.A comparison begs to be made to ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".  In that movie, Satan tempts Jesus by showing him just what he's giving up by allowing himself to be crucified for the sins of humanity - the love of a woman, a family, in essence giving up the chance at a normal life.  You realize the gravity and scope of that sacrifice and are compelled to admire the choice he made.In contrast, all you get with Gibson's film is a portrayal of the betrayal and subsequent slow, brutal murder of a human being.  The relatively accurate glimpse of life two thousand years ago is a bonus, but I feel that Mel could've made this much more than it ended up being.  It shocked me, but it didn't go much deeper than that.Considering the subject of the film, that's pretty sad."	2.0	A potentially powerful movie reduced to a splatter film...	2004-09-04	27	17	10

A story read by many, pondered on by fewer and believed by even fewer still, the Passion does what no other form of media is capable of doing; it draws all the senses together and let's you feel the story of the Gospels.Like all movies that are based on a true story, it goes out on a limb in a few places to fill in the gaps, where books are free to be ambiguous but movies are not. Yet those places are few and far between and in my opinion actually fit the story quite well. We may never know in this lifetime whether the fill-ins are accurate, but I see no greater harm being done then when believers speculate in private as to ""this or that"".A professional ""critic"" Ty Burr, of the Boston Globe, stated that the movie was too much focused on gore and not theology and A.O. Scott, of the New York Times, stated that the film seems to arise less from love than from wrath; to which I have to say I'll never read the reviews of these men again. I make this statement confidently, since I, as an occasional moviegoer was able to find what they somehow missed. It's not as though I am the only one, at the time of this writing eleven reviews with an average of ""A"" have been written by the professionals; all but these two are rated high. Therefore I am more inclined to believe that ulterior motives are behind the negative remarks and I find that very unprofessional.A closer look at the criticisms reveals the impractical and unwarranted nature of the attacks. To say that the film lacks theology demands a comparative, that is to say, compared to what? Certainly not your average film, I don't know of too many films that are rich in theology. Comparing the film to other Christian movies, such as the famous one by Charlton Heston, is not comparing apples to apples, in the sense that you expect the Mel Gibson film to be more a dramatic experience than a dry narrative. Don't get me wrong the movies of the past are great in their own respect, but the most dramatic they ever attempt to get is voice inflection, when Charlton lowers his voice and says ""Let my people go"". It's the difference between the Discovery Channel's special on the Holocaust and Schindler's list - both are valuable and both need to be graded based on their own genre. What is surprising is that the movie maintains such a large degree of historical accuracy, not that it is lacking in any or lacking a theological lecture; something the movie was never intended to be. To the charge of a lack of love, I am awestruck. The love that the man Jesus shows is exactly what Christians have maintained for over two millennia. It is the story of a man, wrongly and falsely condemned who shows compassion for those ""who do not know what they are doing"" and who even a sinner dying besides the man Jesus, recognizes as not worthy the punishment but ""praying for you"" in the midst of the horrible torture. ""No greater love has a man, than this..."" cannot be escaped as you watch the film. Truly a most horrible oversight by a self proclaimed ""professional"".All having been said, I am a better person for having watched this movie. Paul Harvey said it best when he said: ""You don't watch this movie, you experience it!"" Perhaps it is due to our multi-media culture, that I have grown up in, or an overall dumbing down of the populace - but I don't seem to be able to create the drama of the film in my mind, when I read a book or listen to a tape. Some people have been blessed with that ability, but not I. For me then, the movie does what no other form of media can, and with the small discrepancies and conjecture on the part of the movie and director aside, I am thankful and proud to recommend Gibson's work."	5.0	The Most Powerful Movie Ever Experienced	2004-11-11	19	10	9
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A35TI8DM5EFPUF	billie r walker	I prepared myself for a week through worship & reading the gospels before I went to see the Passion of Christ. I praise Mel Gibson for showing me, in the best way he knew how, the sacrifice Jesus made for me.  I did receive a blessing through his film & grew closer to my Lord that night, The only problem I had was with the audience.  I could tell which ones came seeking a spiritual experience & those who came to be intertained.  I have to say it was very upsetting.  But then I realized, it was the same crowd that came to see Jesus crucified. And then I was sad for those people.	5.0	The Passion of Christ	2004-02-29	1	1	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A48THA5X4OUAB	Billyjack D'Urberville	"After about 1/4 or 1/3 of the way into this movie, one begins to wonder hard what the fuss was about.  The fact is, unlike Gibson's previous two major historical outings (Braveheart & The Patriot) this movie is about 80 % historical sources (in this case the broad outline of Matthew and other synoptics, with dialogue therefrom), 20 % the director.  The other 2 movies had a less than 50% historicism & were well over 50% personally interpretive -- and at very critical points.  In my view these last two directorial attempts by Gibson were flawed for such reasons -- given very questionable historical interpretations in both.  These were the trepidations I had before viewing this movie, rather than the rest of the unbelievable hoopla.The fact is, lacking either Roman or Jewish sources for Christ's passion (although both the Roman Tacitus and the Jewish Talmud admit Christ was actually put to death during Pilate's tenure) there is no detailed historical source other than the gospels for this story, like it or not.  Coldly viewed, the film is thus no different than several other films which more or less rigorously follow some pre-existing text -- putting aside the question whether the text is fact or fiction, ie. Kubrick's Barry Lyndon ( historical novel), Fellini's Satyricon (ancient book that may or may not be historically based), The Bounty (mixed fact and fiction). It is virtually impossible to imagine a filmic treatment of any text that does not have at least a 10 to 15% dose of interpretation from the maker. So the criticism that has followed  is necessarily not based on the Gibson interpretation, but against the gospel itself.  The argument, necessarily then, must be that the gospel should no longer be represented filmically, for some reason.  This is a political question, since such censorship could only be enforced by political means.  Despite many expressed fears, such a result -- outright censorship -- is hardly likely in the United States, now or in the forseeable future.In brief, if didacticism is properly understood as the artist's overlay of personal vision and interpretation -- and not what the artist's personal creed (religious or political) happens to be -- the film is much less didactic than Gibson's other ventures into historical presentation, and for that matter much less didactic than the vast majority of other film.  The current criticism, again, necessarily is with Gibson's own doctrine; rationally speaking it could not be with the fact he has one (since any honest person will admit that every adult has some sort of a belief system in the broad sense of the word).The historicism of Passion is visually obvious to any rational viewer, believer or unbeliever.  To a disinterested viewer, ie., one without any particular religious axe to grind, the movie resembles nothing so much as an attempt to portray the confusion and cruelty of the ancient world in a highly realistic and authentic manner.  Why this should not be a valid enterprise for an American realist would be hard for critics to say; they avoid the issue.  Research on the institution of Roman crucifixion and scourging demonstrates that this sort of scholarship much more informs the making of Passion than, say, Gibson's use of the Catholic mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich, which while it has been much vaunted is really only window dressing here.  The long and short of it is that the scourging (the truly new element in this passion film presentation, never previously so fully rendered in other films about Christ) is highly informed realism consistent with scholarship and with the reason for this scourging, in Christ's case.  See  Zugibe, ""Forensic and Clinical Knowledge of the Practice of Crucifixion"" (Turin 2000); Zaninotto, ""The Shroud and Roman Crucifixion:  A Historical Overview"" (Turin 2000).The realism and subtlety of the portrayal of Roman leaders and the Roman system in this film far outdistances the best of similar recent ventures, ie. Gladiator.  It matches the highest standard I know of in this area, Kubrick's Spartacus.  I doubt Gibson's Pilate will ever be improved upon; it is worth the price of admission.  You may like this or that disciple in the film more, but take a close look at Pilate if you can stand it; this guy is really us.I would also frankly admit that the Jewish authority figures are not presented with the same subtlety.  It would be a better film if they had been.  But their milieu in this film is not presented as malicious in any sense, rather highly confused (which Pilate points out).  In any event the figure who is quite obviously the hero of the film, in the full classical sense, Jesus, not only reinforces Pilate's verdict on their behavior -- ""they know not what they do"" -- but also explicitly forgives them.  A person attempting to pin an anti-Semetic didacticism onto this film therefore ignores the most pointed statements on the subject by the story's focus and hero -- a most dubious venture.  Of course, it is well known that the anti-Passion  campaign has only been successful by innuendo, guilt by association (Gibson's father), and other tactics unworthy of serious discourse.If one is reduced to keeping count of such things as an indicator, the subtlety of the psychological realism of the characters portrayed, and their corresponding sympathy, switches polarity at the street level (unlike Caiphas, most ordinary Jews at street level are remarkably ""round,"" in E. M. Forster's sense, as compared to the rank and file Romans who, unlike Pilate, are somewhat cartoonish).  Such an effect is not possible, of course, if the director or text is anti-Semetic.  Before using such terms regarding film, one ought to know the real thing by having viewed a couple ""educational"" films from Nazi Germany about the science of eugenics.  In any event, true racism is objectively presented in the movie -- of certain Romans against Jews.Beyond the authentic/realistic context, our hypothetical viewer without a particular credal axe to grind, knowing nothing of the new testament (like a man from Mars) would most likely just legitimately wonder -- why are they doing this to this man?  The film's explanation (based on Matthew) is Jesus' apparent claim to be part of a deity, by a certain formula of words.  Focusing on the passion, the film does not fully explain this -- the man from Mars would basically come away with an impression of some sort of great taboo that was broken, causing frenzy and confusion among the Jewish authorities.  But again, malice would not be the conclusion.  Indeed Caiphas is portrayed as not wanting to kill Christ before the taboo words are spoken.  An objective atheist or our man from Mars could not then come away holding that any sort of assumed racial defect or malignancy was the cause.  If anything, it is the sheer power of the taboo that is the cause.  A true atheist or confident rationalist would not fear this critical focus of the movie, then, since he would reject the taboo ipso facto as a religious belief system.  Indeed he might well yet be interested in the film, very interested in it indeed, as a modern attempt to authentically portray the consequences of breaking a powerful taboo in the ancient world.The fact is, I have heard no criticism based on the fact that the movie justifies the breaking of the taboo against saying ""I am.""  Yet a truly principled attack on the movie would not only have to start there, but grapple with that centrally, and then say something in favor of continuing that taboo in conclusion, ie, censorship of texts or artworks that include that verbal formula.  Of course, none of us have heard such a thing.Regarding the use of Anne Catherine Emmerich, the Marian and/or ""stations of the cross"" images, etc.:  this is nothing more than Gibson's signature, the 20% quotient of interpretivism.  It is mainly visual, and neither adds nor subtracts any major element not in the source, Matthew.  It is a question of emphasis.  And it serves to give artistic unity to the whole.  Yes, it does also admit that Gibson is a believer -- such an unambiguous admission to the audience actually being an honest, and therefore praiseworthy virtue, even from the perspective of an ethical pagan.  Only certain modern pagans, cut loose from Aristotle, Homer, and the roots of Western culture, advocate the creation of subversive artwork that fools or tricks its audience into beliefs or attitudes cleverly disquised or contra-indicated.  While a prime tool of Marxists, such tactics were considered unworthy in the ancient world and indeed there are no known texts from that world which employ such a strategy.Actually, the real subject of this movie is conversion.  Gibson conveys Christ's gaze as the operative machine of this process, with some analogy  to the fine use of Christ's shadow by director Nicholas Ray in King of Kings (1961).  Comparing and contrasting to this and other filmic precedents would be more interesting than much of what we have been hearing, not only from foes but also from some purported friends of Passion.I have been trying to write this in a manner to avoid taking a lot away from a fresh first viewing, which I certainly urge.  But I cannot help adding one last comparison -- of the Simon scene to John Paul II's poem, ""Portait of a Cyrenean"" a/k/a ""Simon of Cyrene.""  One cannot claim that Gibson read the late pope's poem, but the visual parallels are remarkable.Actually, your best prep for this movie might be to rent out a good silent movie, like Abel Gance's Napoleon or anything featuring Chaplin.  The subject appears to have pushed Gibson back to the roots of cinema: gestures and faces.  Thankfully not everything is subtitled.My overall conclusion: 3.85 stars out of 5.  I don't hold with those that think this is the greatest movie ever made.  The Christian Word -- which includes the dogma of a personal Savior and all the eccentricity that may go with it --is  inherently incapable of a 5 star movie, or a 5 star artwork of any kind.  The closest post-Biblical Christian literature came to 5 stars was Dante, who admitted his failure in his Divine Comedy's last line, and that was a supreme admission from a very proud man and ought to set us all to fear and trembling.  Rembrandt for the most part gave us a lot of 3.75 star Jesus paintings, and to borrow from Hemingway, he probably had the best shot at the title.  Well, there is a fine Rembrandt etching of the Crucifixion that clocks in at about 4.1.  As for the movies, every sincere effort gives you a facet of the Christ -- Jeff Hunter in King of Kings, teamed up with Nicholas Ray behind camera, was heading for a 4.3 maybe, but as we say in Indy town, he ""kissed the wall.""  See it again anyway and ignore a lot of the script (based on the top ""scholarship"" of its day, by the way).Saint Bernard, a.d. 1200, saw the West taking a questionable turn before the Renaissance, as far as religious art is concerned:  a return to sheer classic realism is a gain, of course, but also a loss because the room for the personal vision is thereby limited.  If you have seen Michelangelo's Pieta you cannot imagine that scene ever another way.  I thus don't grant any Michelangelo, DaVinci, Raphael, Bernini etc more than a 3.7 when it comes to Jesus Christ.  Mel gains not because he's more talented than those guys, but because those guys are his school and he builds on them.  Many justifiably still prefer icons in this particular competition.John the Apostle even threw in the towel on this one, you know: ""He said many other things but not all the books in the world ...."" & etcetera.  So as our famous dean of American realism might have put it, ""Don't get into the ring with John the Apostle.""Of course, Mel did get into the ring, didn't he?  Of his hubris there is no doubt -- its just not very apparent in this movie, though, scene by scene -- or at least on the surface.  As for even undertaking the project -- sure, that's some hubris, all right.  But Gibson's stepping into this ring only proves that in the realm of art, certain rules can be broken if counter-balancing compensations are made.  Here, as in much of the best art of this country, the bow was to the aesthetic of realism with both feet.  The movie has much more in common with Clint Eastwood's unflinching look at the old west in The Unforgiven than with any filmed version of any didactic tract or religious text.  If you want your didacticism plain, go see a Star Trek movie and may be the wind be at your back.As for this film, there's enough going on in it -- including much not mentioned here -- that you should avoid as much of the debate as possible, even or especially from Mel's friends, and just go see it with an open mind as to what will hit you from a talented believer shrewdly aware of both his own limitations and those of film generally."	4.0	Trying to Look at the Passion Dispassionately	2005-10-01	7	4	3

Fanatics of NyQuil could potentially be dangerous, so don't give Christian fanatics something else to use against anyone who may happen to have a different belief that they do.Did Jesus go through this? Something like it, probably not exactly. Does Mel Gibson deserve the money he makes? No. Did Mel Gibson take a risk? No. He already had a large audience that would go see the movie even if no one else would. But he knew everyone would go see it because it's controversial. Controversy make a lot of money, look at Eminem.This movie is not a life changing experience because it is a movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3AF8P0GINFADV	Black Barbie	At first sight, I reckoned this was going to be some self-righteous film that aimed to convert as well as to impose. I was wrong. This film focuses on Jesus of Nazareth from Judas Escariot's betrayal to Jesus' death. On a visual level, Gibson successfully incorporates graphic violence with flashbacks to give the viewer a convincing view of how Jesus may lived and how he suffered. In terms of substance, the acting was superb - James Caviezel was the perfect person to play Jesus. There was something about him -- I thought his presence gave the film the intensity that it had. However, other figures such as Mary Magdalene to the Roman soldiers were excellent. It is clear that a great deal of emotion and feeling went into the actors performances - you can feel Mary's pain when she is crying for her son and her desperate need to console him and you can almost feel that Judas' betrayal is eating away at him. Furthermore, another positive point was the language enriched the film and made it more authentic. Regardless of what religion you are part of, if you are an agnostic or an atheist, this film is highly recommended because it is an intense study of human flaws such as betrayal and condemnation.People will have differing views on this film because religion is such a controversial topic but don't let yourself be discouraged by negative reviews - you have to see it to make up your own mind.	5.0	Overwhelming	2004-04-10	1	0	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2U0ZTNJA3YRZV	Black Jack	The Passion of the Christ is controversial because the person it  depicts is the most controversial person in the history of the world.One cannot accuse the movie of being anti-semitic without accusing the gospels for the same.  The movie is true to the gospel account of the passion of Jesus.Yes it is bloody and some may not like the blood and violence in the movie.  But as  Monica Bellucci (acting as Mary Magdelene) said, 'it is a violent film against violence.'Owning this movie is like owning a copy of the Bible.  I bet it is going to be a part of every Christian video collection.Mel Gibson had undertaken the most daring project in Hollywood history.  The film was written off by the media from the very beginning.  Mel put in $25 million of his own money into a film he deeply believed in.Once again the doom's day prophets of the media were wrong when they said that no one would want to buy the video.  On the very first day of it's release on 1st Sept. 2004 it sold 4.1 million copies and hit no. 1 on the amazon.com sales list.I recommend strongly with this movie 'Jesus of Nazareth' by Franco Zeffirelli (ASIN: B0000633QW).  Originally made for TV in 1977, this in-depth (six hours plus) version of Jesus' life is thorough. It accurately protrays the life of Christ from the gospels right from his birth to the crucifixion and his resurrection.For reading besides the Gospel account from the Bible, I would recommend 'Life of Christ' by Fulton Sheen. It is a literary masterpiece.  It will unravel the mysteries behind every event of the gospel in a way that has never been done before.	5.0	A Controversial Film about a Controversial Person.	2004-09-11	11	8	3

I thought to myself, ""Here it is - He committed no sin, harmed no man, and yet even as they cursed him and spit upon Him - He was able to pray for their forgiveness.  And so many of us today, can't find it in our hearts to forgive someone who merely cut us off in traffic.""The film was beautiful and the acting was superb.  I got an opportunity to see Jesus, not only as my Lord and Saviour, but as a man who loved His mother and as a Son loved by His mother.A friend of mine, who went to view the film with me, commented that she had goosebumps as she left the theatre.

This film is only as violent as it needs to be in order to show todays world what  sacrifice is really like. Comparisons to ""Death Wish"" and ""Chainsaw"" movies are ridiculous. By observing the anguish of Christ, my understanding and appreciation for him is far greater than if I had squeamishly turned away.That other wonderful movie, ""The Gospel of John"" is a brilliant portrayal of a complete gospel with fantastic acting and narration.  It shows us the life of Jesus and is a tremendous teaching tool. ""The Passion..."" offers us only a fraction of the words of truth and love that Christ has to share.  Instead we are given our first chance to share in the death and sacrifice of our savior spoken in the original languages, which rather than creating a barrier have broken a barrier to realism.If the temple guards are portrayed as brutal, so be it. Why wouldn't they be? If Caiphas and the Pharisees seem unforgiving and enraged, why wouldn't they?

In fact one reason I watch a movie is to escape reading. Perhaps that wouldn't have bothered me so much if the subtitles were left on the screen long enough to read which often they aren't.The acting isn't anything really great but then exactly how is an actor supposed to bring any insight into a character when the majority of the movie is comprised of painful and anguished expressions of a man who's been flayed alive?! The fella portraying Jesus of Nazareth does a pretty decent job of expressing sincere pain especially in the throws of death but watching the contemptuous and sneering/laughing expressions of the Roman army becomes somewhat tedious, repetitious and a bit annoying.The general consensus seems to be it's either a glorious masterpiece or a hateful/bigoted piece of filth and I'm very glad to disagree. This flick isn't anywhere near as bad as much of what the industry puts out these days but neither is it the best thing I've seen (even this week).

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1KGAGI7YN8V9E	Bookman	"Reflections on The Passion of Christ:Inundated by the sound and the fury of endless media discussions about Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, and wanting to stay abreast of important current events, I decided to brave the long lines and get an early took at such a significant phenomenon. I thought it might be better to actually see it before proffering an opinion.As I experienced The Passion, it become clear that in a couple of areas many of the negative pundits were, as Shakespeare would say, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""Anti-Semitism: The most loudly trumpeted objection to the movie by the many pundits was that it would inspire anti-Semitism. While the religious leaders in The Passion were fervent in their desire to have Jesus crucified, the average American - not burdened with medieval European hatreds, would see no more than a bunch of pompous big-wigs trying to kill off the competition.They represent Everyman, not just jealous Jewish leaders, as the Iranian clerics showed by excluding Muslim moderates from running in their elections. In addition, leaders hiring hit men to do their dirty work is, after all, a great tradition among criminals, businessmen, and politicians.Jealousy is jealousy, no matter where it pops up. Most Americans would see the Sanhedrin as jealous leaders, not jealous Jews.Violence: Movie critics who praise and give awards to the most horribly violent and disgusting films are now complaining about the violence in The Passion. It is ironic to hear complaints about violence from critics who have absolutely no compunction about foisting even the most perverted garbage upon our children as Great Art.Mis-characterized bad guys: The idea that ""we know that Pilate was too bad to have had second thoughts about killing Jesus"" is simply silly. A man intelligent enough to be governor of the toughest Roman province was certainly capable of wondering whether a charismatic teacher who was constantly followed by thousands should be executed by obviously jealous leaders whom Pilate didn't like much anyway. May we be protected from theological novelists.Although Mel added a gratuitously gruesome eye-pecking crow for effect, at least he didn't try to change the essential nature of a main character in the reasonable historical accounts that we have.Slightly Negative: As one who comes from a religious tradition that mixes enthusiastic worship with quiet meditation, I fully expected to be moved to tears and renewed devotion by the movie, as I am often moved by movies that have much less of a claim on profundity than the Passion. But I did not seem to experience the strong emotions that some have professed after seeing the film.Why? First of all, while a realistic vivid portrayal of the beatings and torture of Christ could give moviegoers an accurate picture of the physical sufferings that he endured, there comes a point at which such details numb rather than enlighten the observer. Mel Gibson's tendency in his other movies to stretch out scenes longer than they need to be is evident in The Passion.The horrible beatings inflicted by Pilate's Roman soldiers are almost overwhelming by themselves, though they seem to be more inspired by flagellation fanatics than historical accuracy.Flogging and crucifixion were a science for the Romans, as they tended to give ""forty stripes save one,"" as many more lashes would kill even a strong person. A Roman soldier who was charged with simply beating a prisoner would be severely punished if his prisoner died. The blood and gore of the beating scene was clearly overdone, as no one who had lost that much blood could have survived to make it to a crucifixion, which was designed to be a long, painful process to death.Interestingly enough, a more representative picture of the damage done by Roman flogging could be seen on the man of the Shroud of Turin [...], whether or not one believes that the shroud is the genuine burial cloth of Jesus.While wounds from flogging would be terrible, they wouldn't be as overwhelmingly grisly as the bloody dissections in Mel Gibson's reconstruction. And then Mr. Gibson adds even more beating scenes in an excessively violent journey from Pilate's Place to the place of crucifixion.It is unlikely that highly-disciplined Roman soldiers would have behaved in such an undisciplined way, creating and accepting near-riot conditions during the long walk to Golgotha by someone who had already been beaten to a pulp.It is also unlikely that even a healthy man could carry the huge 400-pound cross up and down such steep hills. I expect that potential victims would only carry the crosspiece, not the whole cross.As followers of Jesus generally believe that the burden of collective responsibility for all of the sins of the world was far worse than physical suffering, which many have endured, it would seem a bit unbalanced to over-emphasize one at the expense of the other. But maybe that's a question for theologians to endlessly argue about - not movie-goers.However, for all its weaknesses, The Passion is probably the most realistic portrayal of a powerful and charismatic Jesus and the humanity of his mother Mary ever seen in a movie.Along with the final scene, which is, after all, the main thing that distinguishes Jesus' death from many other victims of torture, Mel Gibson's movie graphically illustrates why the followers of Jesus profess to love a leader who can, in the face of the most hideous torture, ask his Father to ""forgive them, for they know not what they do."""	4.0	Passion Passion: Realistic, Unrealistic, Educational, and Politically Incorrect	2007-03-25	0	0	0

Watching what Jesus went through makes my issues so small. The things we complain about in everyday life could not compare to the Cross that Jesus had to bear.I am a Catholic and had no issues with Mel Gibson and this movie. It is a story that needed to be told from a different point of view, a view that was more reallstic. The Passion of the Christ was very graphic and that's what made it a superb movie. The movie touched me so that I have not watched it again since the first time I viewed it, because it made me take a hard look at myself. What I need to do more to be a peace with God and myself, not to say that I don't want to, it just seems like its so much work to do. I need to take heed to this movie and be more forgiving because what has been done to me is nothing like what has been done to Jesus.While wrong was being done to him, he repeatedly asked his Father to forgive them because they know not what they do. That is deep, so deep because we are so quick to seek revenge on out enemies.Please forget about the hype that is surrounding this movie, look past that and learn a valuable lesson.Later...."	5.0	Do I really have problems?	2004-09-07	8	4	4

At times it was so violent that it was impossible to even believe (in a cheesy Hollywood way). I was looking forward to a movie that focused on the ""passion"" aspects of Jesus' story, but this one was disappointing. It is well known by now that the Romans did not crucify people in the manner portrayed in this film (search the web for ""Jehohanan"" the crucified man for more info). That might seem like a trivial detail except that this film deals almost exclusively with the torture and death of Jesus. Also, I would have begun the film with Jesus' arrival into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. If you're not familiar with the Gospels, you'll probably feel lost in this movie. Finally, anyone who would allow a young child see a violent movie like this should be arrested for child abuse. I didn't feel any sort of emotional experience watching this in the way that I feel when I see movies like ""Jesus Of Nazareth"" or ""The Last Temptation Of Christ."" I just felt like whoever made this film was seeking to commercialize this story. BTW - I cannot believe ANYONE could have survived that flogging, much less carry a cross that size after coming to.

I thought Gibson's 'Braveheart' was one of the most vile, disgusting pieces of filth ever made. (Historical inaccuracies, glorification of violence, flat out false hoods, openly biggoted comments, the very UNSUBTLE attacks on gay people, and the totally amoral glofification of people getting killed.) On the other extreme, his ""Hamlet"" was very beautifully done. A little different from Shakespeare's masterpiece, but nothing that really hurt the play. This movie is somewhat in the middle. The scenery is ok. The costumes are alright. And there are some interesting character portrayals. (Pilate and Simon of Cyrene) It is an interesting watch, but it lacks the indepth scholarship of ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (1977). If you are looking for a movie that has deep character development as well as some really educated speculation, than you are probably better off with Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (1977).

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A24G1H61L0TQHN	"Brad Shorr ""Brad Shorr"""	Some say this film is fixated on the suffering of Jesus, that there is much more to His Passion than pain.  It seems unfair to judge any film for what it is not, instead of what it is&#65533;namely, a physically graphic, agonizingly detailed reenactment of His final hours.  Considering how profound and far-reaching is the message of Jesus, and how impenetrable is the mystery of His existence, I think Mr. Gibson makes a fine artistic choice in limiting his themes and thereby enabling (forcing?) us to appreciate the magnitude of His sacrifice. Violent?  Without question.  But violence is essential to the story.  I recall &#65533;Schindler&#65533;s List&#65533; and my revulsion at the depictions of utterly inhuman violence.  Yet, to not see such a film, to close one&#65533;s eyes to the message, is almost to deny the Holocaust.  Can we afford to do that?  Holocaust survivors emphatically say &#65533;no!&#65533;  In the same way, how can we sanitize Christ&#65533;s Passion and still come to terms with it?  If the violence of the film makes us uncomfortable, perhaps it is a discomfort for our own spiritual good.  That being said, I found the physical brutality far less appalling than the dark sides of human nature Gibson so graphically portrayed&#65533;the lusty sadism of His torturers, the calculating manipulations of the megalomaniac Caiphas, the mindless, reflexive scorn of the Pharisees, the debauchery of Herod, the crass moral relativism of Pilate, the utter indifference of the people, and even the temporary cowardice of Peter.  It is far less unnerving to watch physical acts of brutality I would never think of committing than to watch these spiritual acts of sinfulness I commit daily to one degree or another. Yet, there is more than enough human goodness in the film (to say nothing of the subtle but powerful portrayal of His divine goodness) that I came away with great hope and a raised spirit.  The devotion of the Virgin Mother, the amazing conversion of Simon of Cyrene, and the periodic flashbacks to inspiring events in the life of Jesus, show us that with His help and example and inspiration, we can see evil for what it is and begin to overcome it.	5.0	Magnificent!!!	2004-03-01	1	1	0

The point of this movie isn't what Mel Gibson or any of the actors think.  The point is what's happening on the screen.  If you don't get that, you don't get the message.  Why cloud the true message with a bunch of talking heads who are only going to say what's been said in countless magazine/newspaper interviews?  This is a powerful movie that needs no explanation.  It captures a part of Jesus' life that has been overly sanitized.  We (Christians) know that Jesus died for us, but how many of us have actually considered ""how"" he died for us?  Watching this movie should make a lot of people sit up and take notice.  It's not an easy movie to watch, but once again, that's the point.  You're supposed to feel uncomfortable.  You're supposed to be horrified by the brutality and callousness of what happened to the Son of God.  Mel Gibson did a magnificent job of capturing the last hours of Jesus' life.  He didn't sugarcoat anything; he didn't downplay any of the ""ugly"" aspects.  I respect him and this movie for that.  This is definitely a movie that stays with you after you watch it.

Yes the violence was extreme, but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We, the audience, become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words, the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not), speaking from a film-only critique, it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh!

It may not be 100% accurate, but the message and the feeling behind it is the truth.  This is to date, the best portrayl of Christ's final hours ever put on film.  Since it was directed by Mel Gibson and stars Jim Caviezel, you know that alot of time and effort, and research, went onto the making of this film.  I think that any creed of Christianity should see this and know exactly what was done for us.  My only complaint, and it is minor,it that there wasn't more shown in the garden of Gethsemene, since it was it fact the most important part of His sacrifice.  But other than that, it is perfect.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A254RFFJDTFJKJ	"Brasington ""johnsan50"""	Critically, this film can be flailed (!) for its omissions, contradictions, etc.  For this, I award four stars.  However, the cinematography, acting, directing, etc. are all tremendous.  It is too strong for children, so don't let your non-teen children see it unless you want them to have nightmares of bloated-eyeball Jesus.  It is a gory torture movie full of blood, pain, and little else.  That said, I think it should be required viewing for everyone else on Earth.  Historically, religiously, and culturally, the film is a triumph, and seeing it make $300 million + at the box office amidst all the cruddy kiddy movies was extremely satisfying.  But don't listen to me--you've already probably decided whether or not to see it.  Here is what this movie will be remembered for after all the hype dies down.Passion is an anomaly within its admittedly odd circle of like-minded films.  Compare 10 Commandments, Ben-Hur, King of Kings, etc. to this film and you get the feeling that the Christians have finally caught up to the realistic standard in cinema since those films were released nearly 50 years ago.  It really is a step forward even from Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, which was released over 15 years ago.  (If you hate that film, by the way, you probably haven't seen it.  It's a beautiful expression of faith in its own right.)  Finally, Gibson takes the bible-history movies into this millenium.Passion is a film made by Christians for Christians.  I know many atheists who saw the film, however, and at least respect the principles of Jesus now.  If anyone says that this is not an achievement, then they know nothing about the difficulties of trying to preach to the uninitiated.  Those people on the street corners handing out flyers get spit on daily; they have guts, too.  Think they're nuts if you want, but admit their determination is uncommon.In the same way, it's necessary to appreciate the message of this film:  this is the man we have based our religion on, and this is what we know he went through.  In dealing only with the tribulation of Jesus, Gibson reduces belief to pain.  Would you suffer physical pain for the notions you hold true?  Few would.  This, my friends, is why we still see him as a model for the rest of us.  Jesus had inner strength uncommon in man.  Gibson is no savior, but he does remind us of something vital with this film.Mel Gibson has a lot of guts.  You have to respect a man who put his neck on the chopping block of public opinion in order to express his religious convictions.  Too bad he didn't have the gall to finish producing F 9/11, but I'll take one major career risk a year as sufficient progress.	4.0	Necessarily brutal.	2004-07-20	19	7	12

While I can understand the controversy, I never fully understood just what Jesus did for us until I saw this film. This was truly a great man. As a bible belt resident who spent 18 years in Sunday School, I already knew about Jesus dying for our sins so that we may enjoy eternal life, so I was not too impressed with this part of the story, no, what amaazed me was that Jesus was the inventor of the modern table. I have read the new testament and never knew that Jesus first had the idea for the modern table. I have two bad knees, so this really raised my opinion of Jesus. Eternal salvation is great, but not having to kneel down when i eat, wow, now that's something to worship a man over. Also I would like to thank the good people at AMC Theatres for reminding me that nothing goes better with incredibly graphic images of our Lord being crucified than popcorn, Diet Coke, and some penut butter M&Ms.	4.0	A powerful revelation	2008-09-05	5	3	2

It has no plot, no character development, and no theology other than ""God hates us"". Mel's legions of worshipers like to use words like ""brilliant"", but the only brilliant thing about it was the marketing. He personally talked to every group of fundies in America to ensure the Christian right that he is every bit as hateful and racist as they hoped, and then he got to just sit back and let the Church take over the marketing. They plugged this flick in nearly every sermon for 3 or 4 months (Was there even ONE church marquee that didn't mention this trash?) and bought out theaters to guarantee its success.Mel engaged in race-baiting (complaining about Jewish criticism BEFORE it even existed), and many Passion-supporters helped out by sending racist letters to Jewish groups (""Didn't the Holocaust teach you people anything?"" one asked.) According to a poll from the Pew research group, the percentage of young people who now blame Jews for deicide has increased to 30%. Perhaps more importantly, though, countless children have been exposed to this gruesome work of brutal piety. It's sadistic. It's pornographic. And it's endorsed by the same people who usually condemn movie violence. What hypocrisy.I don't know which is my favorite Passion-related story. Is it that several people--including Caviezel-- were struck by lightning during filming? Or is it that Mel and Caviezel blamed the lightning on Satan, when historically it's associated with God? Or maybe that a couple got in trouble with the law after stabbing each other with scissors after seeing The Passion?

Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel ""Sadist"" Gibson, I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe, but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim. In short, it's just a movie, not a particularly good one, with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what's happening or to make you care. It looks terrific---Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness. But that's about where the praise ends. The whole thing has a nasty tone; in Mel's version of the tale, anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery, and while I'm not a believer myself, my guess is that's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it. And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end, eyes a-blazin' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack, I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to ""Braveheart Part II."" Mel Gibson is a wretched director, and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously, for that gives them clout they don't deserve. All he's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie, complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire ""Friday the 13th"" series. This stuff was camp 30 years ago, and it's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie's complete lack of narrative grounding.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2EXWZDOCUBS6T	Brian Boozier	I'm sorry.  I was expecting it.  I read about it.  I was dreading it.  But it never assaulted me as I was promised.At first the anti-semitism.  Then the historical shoddiness.  Now the gore.  No anti-semitism.  Good History and well, I've seen far 'gorier' films than the Passion.Kill Bill, Titus, Gladiator, Bravehart, Saving Private Ryan.  These were hard to watch.  But the critics didn't think so.  In my opinion, the hypocrisy with which some of the naysaying critics treated the Passion is astonishing.  I can understand if some genuinely felt conflicted - feeling like the message of Jesus' love was overshadowed by his torture (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone for example) - I can respect such reviews.  But to call this a 'gorefest' - sadistic and even pornographically violent -  equivalent to a snuff film - even to go as far as equating it with Nazi Propaganda - is completely dishonest and vile.I hate gore.  I wince at blood and guts.  But I was able to watch this with eyes wide open.  No guts.  Plenty of bruises, exposed flesh and oozing blood, but nothing like the hacking off of heads, slitting of throats, dismemberment of limbs and squirting of blood that other critically praised films seem to wallow in.  Dont get me wrong - The Passion was brutal and difficult to watch.  It deserves the R rating - but it certainly did not live up to the critics' embellished NC17 warning.  And such reviews come from the same critics that praised Schindler's List for its realism and flicks like Kill Bill and Titus (Julie Taymor) for their style and Gladiator and Braveheart for their courage.  Hmmm?Futhermore, this was a depiction of reality.  Again I allude to Schindlers List and Private Ryan.  Much like the incredible history captured in these great films, this too captured real history.  This wasn't made up.  Nor did Mel intend to wow the public with the sensational exploitation of Jesus' bloody death for entertainment purposes.  Certainly not entertainment - this is to be an experience...a window in time.  This is THE most famous event in the history of mankind - carrying with it both unparallel political and spiritual ramifications.  It deserved to be communicated with raw integrity.Now to address the controversy surrounding the historicity of this picture:  I was pleased with Mel's rendition.  I was pleased to see that history was preserved.  It made sense.  We were given the political and theological context not found at face value in the Gospels.  Of course, this is one man's interpretation - not a documentary.  But I believe Mel's interpretation is worthy of praise.  For instance, Pilate.  I found his role in the death of Christ to be calculated and rich - true to history despite the absolutism with which liberal scholars treat his character in light of this event.  Was he a monster?  Yes.  We can't ignore the fact that he did authorize the crucifixion of a man he believed to be innocent.  But what about the portrayal of his reluctancy?  The circumstances existed to pressure him.  When put in context, it makes total sense that he washed his hands free of Jesus' blood - that he was portrayed as malleable and submissive to the Sanhedrin.  (Given the political ramifications - having been chastized by Rome twice for previous crucifixions and now threatened with the possibility of a riot, not to mention his wife's prophetic nightmare concerning Jesus...it just adds up.  History corroborates this interpretation)  Though imperfect (what dramatization of history is perfect?), Mel did his homework.Although there was no hint of anti-semitism, there was definitely a staggering sentiment of anti-corrupt-political-jewish-leaders-belonging-to-the-sanhedrin-in 30 AD-ism.The message of this film couldn't be more obvious and anyone who misconstrues its intended message of Love - finding hate or any sense of malice therewithin - went to the movie looking to pick a fight with it.  Jesus' Love couldn't be MORE obvious.  Listen to his voice.  Read his eyes.  Read the subtitles.Bottom line:  Mel did an EXCELLENT job focusing on the personhood of Jesus and on the lives of those who were touched by Him.  Especially moving and unique to this picture was the depth of His relationship with His mother.  This is by far the most personal Jesus I have encountered on film.  Mr. Gibson created a moving picture with integrity.  It was as lyrical and poetic as it was real - exactly what he set out to do.  A real God as a real man met with real evil bestowing real love to real people in real need.  And we are the reason why.  Wow.A moving artistic cinematic portrait reminiscent of the rennaisance accentuated by a sweeping score, this was a beautiful film.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2U81L4XYDNL8T	Brian Bowen	I waited some time to watch this movie, and after watching it for the first time I don't think I will be watching it again. The way Mel Gibson decided to depict Jesus of Nazareth's suffering was so grotesque I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the screen. The story is, don't get me wrong, one that must be told. A story of one man that was killed in order to save the human race is extremely courageous. The whole time Jesus of Nazareth was being tortured he was asking that his punishers be forgiven, something that no one but Jesus could or even would do. The entire movie I felt myself hoping that Jesus of Nazareth would be let go, but like the movie Titanic, I knew how it was going to end going in. In the end I do think that Mel Gibson did seem to take it a step further and maybe go over the line. Many scenes were entirely too gruesome, but the point was really driven home, one man suffering for an entire race. The way people were killed in those days are a far cry from the lethal injections today. Those same injections that have been called cruel and unusually, to me a needle would be a much better way than Jesus of Nazareth went out in this movie. Lastly the entire movie is in English subtitles and that did take my eyes off of the scene to figure out the translation of the conversations. Overall the movie as very well done but the fact that this movie put images in my head, all of which are horrifying, is not a good thing.Brian Bowen	2.0	A truly numbing movie	2006-07-10	25	10	15
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2VD0PHPR7SIIK	Brian C. Miller	This is the only movie I have ever seen that I would call an experience. I have never seen any movie which was so riveting that time seemed to stand still. When it was over I had to just sit in my theater seat, decompressing, listening to the beautiful music.This film starts abruptly. I didn't initially realize that I was watching the movie. There are flashbacks to Jesus' ministry and his life. When Jesus was carrying his cross on his way to be crucified, the flashback to the crowds welcoming him a few days before was startling. There's another flashback which is a real tear jerker, and if you haven't seen the film I don't want to even give a hint. I heard about it from a radio show, and even knowing it was coming, the scene still hit me hard.I think that there is about 20% or so artistic license in the film. I don't expect any movie to be absolutely perfect. The crucifiction scene reminded me of Monty Python's Life of Brian, as the arms were bound to the cross and then the nails were put through the palms. The shroud of Turin shows the nails going through the wrist, which actually supports a person's weight.If a person comes away from this movie untouched, I think that person came to see the movie with to many predjudices. I saw a man cruelly punished, yet he had love and forgiveness, even to his dying breath.	5.0	Not just another movie, but an experience!	2004-07-27	15	11	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	Note: Aramaic, Greek and Hebrew with English subtitles.'The Passion of the Christ' released in '03 is a magnificent and powerful film meant not so much to be enjoyed as it is to be endured. It's something you probably won't watch often but something you'll never forget once you do. This is an incedibly brutal yet poetic film about twelve horrific hours that changed the world forever.James Caviezel is absolutely perfect in his characterization of the tortured and rejected Messiah slowly but surely moving closer and closer to his preordained death and final fulfillment of his earthly mission. Monica Bellucci also shines in her understated performance as Jesus' adoring Mary Magdelene, her face mirroring the pain and suffering of her beloved teacher with each stroke of the wip on his pulverized body.There's a surreal, dreamlike feel to the sequences in which Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) appears. Having the Great Adversary played be a woman provides an androgenous quality to the persona of evil that works well. Watching Satan glide through the crowded streets of Jerusalem accompanied by a small entourage of infant-like demons gleefully observing the ongoing torture and humiliation endured by Jesus in his last hours is quite Bergmannesque.Believer - Deist - Agnostic - Atheist? Doesnt matter, a great film is a great film.	5.0	Excess Within Control  ~  The Brutal Poetry Of The Cross	2006-06-23	23	12	11
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2H5H625C57NF8	"Brian Kazmarck ""Virtual Mortality"""	Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most fully realized visions of cinema I have ever witnessed.  Very rarely does a director's intentions fully come through for one reason or another.  Here, Gibson has financed this film himself, hand-picked his cast (mostly unknowns) and put together a coherent and linear script coupled with masterful directing.  And best of all, what you see on the screen is what Mel Gibson saw in his head.  Of course, that can never be known 100%, but, the depth of emotion that this movie goes to, and the rawness of it's power can only mean the the director has gone to incredible extremes to put forth their vision.  Of this Mel Gibson should be commended.  The title of the film is The Passion of the Christ, most commonly referred to as a time consisting of the last twelve hours before Jesus Christ was tortured and crucified.  Anyone looking for the Life of the Christ will not get that in this film.  The title already says what it's about.  The Passion.  Now to the film itself.  First, Jim Caviezel portrays Jesus Christ in the best way possible, spiritually resilient yet completely vulnerable to all the elements of being human.  Totally divine and totally human.  The cinematography is brilliant.  The musical score, while borrowing from the Last Temptation of Christ (supposedly) is just good enough that it supports everything we see but doesn't overdo it.  The choice of having the dialogue in Latin and Aramaic is inspired.  It lends itself to the authenticity of the film.  This leads into the violence of the film.  Well, I wouldn't call it violence, I would call it torture.  Violence is armies lining up on a battlefield or a gunfight followed by a car chase.  The Passion contains a lot of torture and blood.  The question of whether such a brutal portrayal of the torture was necessary, I would be inclined to answer yes, if Mel Gibson's intention was to be as authentic as possible (which it was).  A Roman scourging/flogging brutal and ugly and angry.  Anyone's body would be fileted after such an event, as was Jesus Christ's.  The crucifixion itself is also honestly brutal and ugly as well, and Mel Gibson does not blanket that.  So, what can be said overall?  I don't care to debate the religious context of the film.  It's a work of art, and it should be judged in that arena.  As a film/work of art, The Passion of the Christ succeeds where many other films fail.  It is a fully realized vision of a passionate director.  And for that alone, this film deserves a full five star rating.	5.0	A triumph of vision	2005-05-20	8	4	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3SJ2VSCHZB18	Brian Markowski	"Here's what's good about ""The Passion"". It's a beautifully filmed movie. It's a dark and disturbing look at the last 24 hours in Jesus' life. Its dialogue is all in original tongue (Aramaic and Latin) giving the film a wonderful ancient perspective never before experienced. It's a movie that has an amazing amount of power.Here's what's not so good, it appeals solely to Christians. There is no doubt in Mel Gibson's mind that Jesus is the Son of God. From the appearance of Satan though out the film to the earthquake after Jesus dies, Gibson reminds us that it is not a man we see but God in the flesh of man. As a result of this, it is not surprising that many Jews are offended by this movie. They are portrayed in not the kindness light. Which brings us to our next point, is it a movie about history or faith.In the end, this is a movie about faith.  Sadly, it would be a better movie if others, than just Christians, could access that faith. I don't think this movie tries to divide people or faiths, but any movie solely about a particular kind of faith is going to alienate others. I also know of many children who have seen this movie and I cannot recommend it for them. This is a graphic and violent film that promotes adult discussion about faith. It is not for kids. Finally, since this was such a controversial film, I am surprised by the absence of DVD extras, not even commentary. I think in this movies case, the extras could have been added respectfully in providing a little more clarity to a film that has had such an impact.(3 and a half  stars)"	3.0	3 and a Half Stars	2005-01-04	11	7	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A26PAN8REXYBYH	"Brian M. Ranzoni ""Da Killa B"""	I caught Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* at the Albany Cinema. The latest film about Jesus Christ, messiah of the Christian faiths, Gibson's *The Passion* particularly plays on Christ's torture and crucifixion, beginning 12 hours before Christ's crucifixion. Throughout, Gibson expresses his own passion, while portraying images of abuse, demons, and Jews so over-the-top it sets an altitude record.Down-to-earth, *The Passion* impresses me. It plays as if the makers understood they dealt with a time-honored tale, but wanted to avoid a rehash. Likewise, it plays to impress today's comfortable Americans with the magnitude of Christ's suffering as imagined by Gibson. Finally, I get the impression Gibson drew parallels to his own self-destructive behavior and feelings.As such, *The Passion* draws not entirely unexpectedly from horror films. Gibson sets the audience up with enough jump scenes to rival *Freddy versus Jason*; darkened doors fly open and women jump. Gibson shows people suddenly punched, or snakes abruptly stomped on, or pieces of property slammed about, usually in dark hallways and corners. CGI demons abound in these places; in one case, literally coming out of the stonework. Children sprout reptilian teeth and cloudy eyes as they torment a guilt-ridden Judas. Creepy crawlies crawl out of Satan. In the last scene for Judas, Gibson focuses most on the leering corpse of a decaying donkey. Necro-fans will love this film.So will sadists and masochists. As soon as Jesus surrenders, about fifteen minutes into the film, he is severely beaten, choked cursed, and spat upon. After spending the night in chains, Christ is beaten all the way to the local Roman governor, beaten to King Herod's, beaten back to Pontius Pilate, and thrust upon Roman soldiers who are ordered to chastise Christ. These soldiers obey their liege's orders in a lengthy, graphic torture sequence. Christ carries his cross even though he can hardly walk; Gibson repeatedly shows Jesus collapsing and being beaten as he lay. With another graphic depiction, Gibson takes us on a guided tour of crucifixion.Gibson also managed to pull some interesting rabbits out of his hat with this film. Satan is portrayed as a pale, sexless anti-muse, softly persuading Christ to deny God. Its minions are equally androgynous imps: children with wrinkled leers and deep crow's feet. A brief shot of Hell shows a barren, ridged wasteland, littered with blackened skeletons of unidentifiable creatures.Yes, the demonic imagery made quite an impression on me in this film. I found it more disturbing and memorable than the bloodshed and the suffering of Christ. This is an unfortunate distraction from Gibson's story, but that's what happens when a Hollywood darling and action megastar makes a supernatural movie.Gibson's portrayal of Jews is a more complicated distraction. *The Passion* itself may not be anti-Semitic, but whether by accident, unconsciousness, or design, *The Passion* clearly portrays Jews as the earthly masterminds of Christ's fate.Jewish priests arrest Jesus and condemn him to death. Backed by a raging mob of Jewish citizens, the priests threaten rebellion if Governor Pontius Pilot fails to kill Jesus. Pilot authorizes Jesus' torture to placate the mob.Although sneering Roman soldiers inflict the most heinous tortures seen, Gibson repeatedly takes the camera back to the Jews looking over their shoulders, Satan wandering among the priests. The Roman torturers and guards periodically look over their shoulders in fear of the mob. Unsatisfied, the bloodthirsty Jews threaten to smear Pilot's name as an enemy of Caesar.By now Gibson portrays the crowd as so threatening that Roman guards must beat them back. Pilot, his wife, and his commanding officer are visibly disturbed by the very idea of killing Jesus. All of them speak lines indicating their good faith.-particularly Pilot, who is seen as possibly recognizing Christ's divinity. But the fear that Caesar will have their heads if the Jews rebel inspires them to cave in, and Gibson shows us an endless parade of frothing, jeering Jewish peasants hounding Jesus to his doom.*The Passion* left no question in my mind that the Romans are unwilling victims of Jewish force. It unmistakably emphasized Jewish pressure for Christ's demise. Critics who deny these elements must have seen a different cut of the film.Overall, I walked away inspired more by Gibson's passion than that of Christ. I like his choice to use period language, and I mock people who think he should have filmed in English. I also respect his vision; even if it struck me as a masochistic drama replete with distracting iconography and horror-movie elements, it also struck me with the power of Gibson's convictions. Gibson drives his convictions home with a desaturated, over-exposed cinematography reminiscent of *Saving Private Ryan*.It is a shame, then, that *The Passion of the Christ* is only okay. It distracted me with the scale of the blood and gore and the prominence of the demonic imagery. And whether intended or not, Gibson plainly tips the balance of blame towards Jewish people. Still, it is a powerful story, cutting to a center of the Christian faith. I don't blame people who deny any distractions or anti-Semitic impressions, except to say they need to see the movie again and pay closer attention. Gibson did not make me believe Christ was a real person, let alone one that died for my sins. He sure made me believe his own sincerity, though, and I commend Gibson's passion; it inspires me to express my own views in public forums.	3.0	The Passion of the Gibson	2004-08-01	11	4	7

Having said that it's a very good movie the acting is great. I don't pretend to be a specialist or expert on religion, the bible or so called biblical events but over all it seemed to hold to the idea we've all heard regardless of what our religions are & doesn't seem to try to hollywood it up for effect. Highly recommend it. I haven't seen this in a while but when I did it was in the ancient language of Aramaic which supposeably is a dead language & thus needed subtitles which can make it hard to keep up or for some make the movie seem longer then it is. Still subtitles or not even if you arent religious or cant read subtitles or understand fluenant Aramaic it's still a great movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"The most controversial film of 2004, Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ was widely derided by critics and detractors as a two-hour anti-Semitic pornography/horror flick, complete with splattering blood and arduous torture. But among the Christian community (of which I consider myself a part) and open-minded people who actually saw the film, The Passion stands alone as the most eloquent expression of God's love for mankind ever to grace the big screen.The Passion certainly is violent, but not anymore violent than similarly rated films of the past ten years. But despite contentions by some evangelical Christians that everyone should see this film, I don't think young children should see it. This movie is for mature audiences only, and I think anyone under the age of sixteen should have a full understanding of the previous events underlying the main focus of the film before viewing it.The entire movie was filmed in the original Aramaic with English subtitles. This enhances, rather than detracts from, the film's enjoyment because it creates an emotional aura of mystery and sacredness to the subject. Since most people are at least vaguely familiar with the storyline, you won't find yourself distracted by reading subtitles as one might think. With just the opposite effect, you find yourself paying greater attention to the visual images displayed on the screen, and the power of the events unfolding before you is amplified several times over.The Passion of the Christ combines the four written accounts found in the New Testament Gospels to create a vivid and powerful portrayal of the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.The film opens in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus of Nazareth (James Caviezel) is engaged in prayer, asking his Father to deliver him through the events soon to come. A satanic figure lurks in the shadows, dispensing a series of temptations and doubts. ""No one man can bear the sin of the world. It's impossible. It's too much,"" the figure says. When Jesus refuses to give into Satan's temptations, his disciple Judas arrives to betray him to the Temple Guard...Gibson's cinematic genius is apparent by his measured and precise use of flashbacks which draws the audience away from the violence in brief intervals so as not to cause an emotional overload. Flashbacks include Jesus teaching to a crowd about his power to ""lay down my life, and take it back up again,"" Jesus washing the feet his disciples at the last supper, and Jesus as a playful personality interacting with Mary. One particularly powerful scene traces back to Jesus as a toddler. When he falls down and injures himself, a panicked Mary runs to his rescue. This flashback correlates with the film's portrayal of Jesus stumbling under the weight of the cross.Overall, this ranks as one of the greatest films ever made. If you believe Jesus of Nazareth was the Biblical Messiah (which this film reviewer does), then The Passion illustrates the enormity of God's sacrifice. But even if you think Jesus was just a mere mortal, this film serves a valuable purpose in that it underscores the barbarity of a human race that, more often than not, persecutes the innocent. Mel Gibson's greatest production to date is a film every student of history, philosophy, and human nature owe it to themselves to see...The DVD Report"	5.0	Emotionally powerful...	2005-04-20	15	13	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ASV9DYAW4ZM89	"Brother Shane ""Brother Shane"""	Although not completely accurate, it's the best and most realistic film of the suffering and crucifixion of our Lord.I had seen it the day it was released in theaters, but this was only the second time I've viewed it. It made for an interesting experience. Not only was i moved and drenched in tears...again, but i was also able to be more of a film critic this time. I noticed they reduced the amount of gore and injuries on the body of Jesus. It would have been much worse than what they showed. Not that that was their fault...it was most likely advised to them because audiences would already be in shock for what they were seeing. I would rather have seen it the way it actually happened, but this telling was enough to get the desired effect.As you watch Him recieve His stripes, you cannot help but think that, with every lash, another disease was just erased from our life. All our sickness was taken upon Him.I doubt that Mary stood under Him and was sprayed by His blood, but overall, this was an egrossing and powerful viewing experience.Children under 8 years old should not watch it, unless you feel they're truely mature enough. I would think it'd be too much for their young minds to grasp, but 8 and older should see it. Children by that age know right from wrong good enough. They should see what it took to have all their wrongs erased. It might make them appreciate things more as well.Some of you might think it traumatic for a child that young to watch. I disagree. I don't think God would let that happen. If your 8 year old watches this film and has nightmares, then I'd be fasting, praying and making sure my own life was in order. Because if that is the case, it's not the film that's giving him nightmares...it's evil spirits...in your home.****1/2 4 and a half stars (to earn 5 stars it would need to be Scripturally perfect)	4.0	A film we should all see	2005-09-21	12	8	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1E964QT0AQKLU	"br_tengu ""br_tengu"""	"This movie has some scenes that are violent (nothing that hasn't already been show in other movies before), but it's not gratuitous violence. The violence depicted in this movie has the objective to emphasize the contrast between the atrocities that Christ suffered and the power of forgiveness and love that never fails him.  Whether you are a Christian or not, the fact is that for Christians (and therefore in the context of this movie) Christ is the son of God. So, we have to understand that the violence against Christ is even more shocking because he was suppose to be adored and revered. Instead, this person - that should be revered -  was despised,  humiliated, tortured and finally crucified. In this day and age Christ would be considered a ""loser"": he was poor, hated, disregarded. Despite all these things, Christ accepted his destiny and forgave his enemies by the power of Love. That's the core message of the Passion and it can only be fully understand if we realize the ordeal that he went through and that's the purpose of the violence shown in the movie. That's why this movie may have a strong impact in some people, specially believers: they may realize for the first time the amount of punishment that the Son of God suffered, and that he did it for us.I rated this movie 4 stars because I would like to have seen more flashbacks about Christ's life during the ""Via Dolorosa"". I think that that could have been better explored. Anyway, kudos to Mel Gibson for having done an exceptional movie, even going against Hollywood (that revenged by not nominating the movie for any Oscar).To end this little review I'd just like to mention that the Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern who plays Virgin Mary is Jew and she is also a daughter of a Holocaust survivor.  If she had seen any trace of anti-Semitism in the movie I'm sure she wouldn't have taken part in it."	4.0	It's not gratuitous violence	2005-03-03	4	4	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ALC3LG8YTNHU3	"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow"""	"A few observations (without spoilers)I finally saw this movie when it was released on home video. I went twice to watch it in theaters and was appalled by the ""audience"" awaiting admittance. The first time, I was walking from the parking lot to the box office when a small bus pulled up and a church Sunday school group that included roughly a dozen small children (ages 5 to maybe 8 roughly)hopped out with chaperones. I got in line behind them and listened to the adults talking about the number of times they had each seen the film and how much they were looking forward to discussing it with the children afterwards. Having been previously advised from numerous places of the ""realism"" of the torture sequences and crucifixion, I decided the greater ""horror"" for me would be in seeing these small children react to the supposedly graphic violence. I simply walked back to my car and went home. The second time (a few weeks later after the initial ""rush"" of people going to a new movie had died down a bit)I actually managed to purchase a ticket and was waiting in the lobby for the previous screening to let out. A few minutes later, the doors opened and the crowd began shuffling out. Once again there were several families with small children. While the parents attempted to masquerade their emotional reactions by blinking and talking about how the sudden bright sunlight was ""tearing"" them up, the children weren't old enough to be embarrassed about showing feelings in public. Most were openly sobbing, all had red eyes, and one small girl (perhaps 4 or 5 years old at most) was shaking so badly that her dad had to pick her up, console her, and carry her outside. Once again, I was so upset and angry I had to leave.Now that I've seen it with my own eyes I can see why those kids were so freaked out.Although I don't belong to one of the most commonly known denominations, I am a Christian. I am also a daily reader of the scriptures, and have lectured on biblical scripture and prophecy all over the Eastern U.S. in churches and seminaries, as well as on college campuses. In other words, while I wouldn't define myself as an expert on all things God, I'm a bit more spiritually ""seasoned"" than most laypeople.The life of Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Bible, is centered around the final 3 years of his earthly life. His birth is depicted - especially in regards to the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and Jewish traditions - and there is a brief mention of his youth in the book of Luke. There are literally dozens of events during the 3 years of Christ's earthly mission that are filmworthy. In fact, the sheer number of films made about his life stand as proof of that fact. Did the world truly need a story that not only focuses primarily on Jesus' final week, but uses every means of modern effects to splatter gore and depict the massive agony endured by the Son of God? Maybe I'm in the minority (apparently, I should say) but I don't need to watch Jesus writhe and scream with each strike of the lash in order to respect and understand the sacrifice such suffering represented. I didn't need to personally witness the nails being driven in, the biblical depiction sufficed. The Glory of Christ's sacrifice is not found in his willingness to endure pain and death in God's name. Literally hundreds of millions of ordinary people have done that before Christ's birth as well as after. The Glory of Christ is found in the Word of God that came from his lips and the power of the Holy Spirit that transformed the entirety of humankind.We are asked to live the message and believe in Christ's name. We are not required to bear witness to the atrocities committed to his human vessel.But most important of all, I deeply believe that forcing or allowing small children to endure the trauma of watching the torture and murder of someone they have been taught to love above all others is not only unnecessary, but borders on abuse. Learning of the Passion from the Bible or from suitable talks with parents, clergy, and Sunday school teachers should be enough education for a small child to understand that God loves them and that Jesus can live within their hearts.Mel Gibson may have had the best intentions (my right to judge ends at the tip of my own nose) but I am of the opinion that the end result represents a massive and grotesque misjudgement.Feel free to slam this review if that is your wont. But please take a moment to consider whether this film is age appropriate to your own children as well.Thank you for your time."	1.0	The Book was better.	2012-04-05	24	11	13

There is unfortunate confusion concerning which version of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is on this DEFINITIVE VERSION. Though the back of the DVD cover only mentions the RECUT version (about 5 minutes shorter); this DEFINITIVE VERSION contains the ORIGINAL version as the one you see when you hit the PLAY button.The RECUT version is to be found in the SPECIAL FEATURES section of the Main Menu. There, it even says that the Commentaries are only available on the full length version, not the Recut. This is too bad that this DEFINITIVE VERSION is so poorly described on its own back cover. I am sure that it has diminished sales of this superior DEFINITIVE VERSION, since you can't tell that the original version is on the DVD until you actually get it home and watch it yourself! I had it at home for a week before I found out that both version were included!The widescreen is best for THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, of course, since some scene compositions are often too large to see everything going on, if you are watching a FULL Screen DVD. This is most notable in the scene when the serpent is stomped on, a real crowd pleaser due to Scriptural references, but in the Full Screen I think it is hard to even see that the snake was in the picture! The DEFINITIVE VERSION only comes in Widescreen.This DEFINITIVE VERSION is years overdue, in my opinion, but at least it is finally available! IT IS GREAT, if you like Commentaries and Making Of documentary material.There is about 100 minutes of short Making Of topics, which you can hit PLAY ALL to watch it non-stop. This is all good, and what you would expect to see. There is a lot of insightful information concerning the filming of this classic masterpiece film! Then there is another half hour, or so, of theological video documentary material, not specific to THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST film, but about the Gospel sections that are shown in Mel Gibson' movie.The Commentaries are very good, as well! Mel Gibson appears on two different Commentaries. The first one is dominated by Mel, with two other folks who made the film with him, and there is another Commentary with Mel concerning theological concepts. Mel takes a back seat on this one, but he can still be heard every once in a while, but it is still a very interesting Commentary, though it may be heavier on Catholic concepts than even the actual film seems to be. It is still very interesting.I learned a lot from all of these Bonus Features! For instance, they shot most of the film using different frames per second, to make motions look more graceful. Also, there's talk about things like Satan's old baby, finally explained by Mel! This shows how evil mimics good things, but when you look closer, the perversion is revealed. There is also a short video shot of Mel trying to coach Satan into licking the old baby's face, which Satan reluctantly does, though it did not make the final cut.This DEFINITIVE VERSION is a MUST HAVE for any fans of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST film! It is too bad that it is confusingly labeled, and years later than it should have been released, but you will likely forgive all that after you have gone through all the new Bonus Features and Commentaries, and you will have understood the intents of Mel Gibson and his collaborators much better, and maybe even pick up a few theological things that you might not have thought of before!	5.0	Contains BOTH the ORIGINAL and RECUT Versions!

He is alive and well.  Mel Gibson has a great reward awaiting.  I am filled with joy, tears, and peace just to know that I or anyone else could not have endure the things Jesus did.  We would have been dead from day one.  All that for us.  He suffered without saying a word.  He was abused and never said a word, just for us today.  We should live as Jesus did and we should love one another and pray for one another as Jesus did.  All that for me.  I'm thankful and greatful.

The film is expertly crafted and directed beautifully; it is, actually, the first time I have been impressed with Gibson's directorial ability.  There's no question he can direct violence better than almost anyone out there... but is it that bloodlust that made him decide to focus on these 12 hours?  Here's what we have to keep in mind:THE CREATION1) For those of us who never fully fathomed the horrors of Jesus's death, Gibson shoves it in our faces and forces us to deal with it.  The central event of Christianity, the elephant in the center of the room, is finally poured out in all its disgusting honesty.2) Contrary to critical opinion, I found the brief Resurrection sequence to be incredibly redeeming and inspiring, perhaps because of how short it was and not in spite of it.3) Every aspect of the filmmaking is superb and gives more weight to the message of the gospels.After seeing the film, I was stunned.  And then, over then next week, I began hearing more and more about Mel's dubious character...	4.0	One Human Being and his Artistic Expression	2004-03-02	10	4	6

You can say what you want about Mel Gibson but he really nailed it here. This story, so simple in it's broad, cinematic release simply tells the tale of Jesus, a simple spiritual giant who came, taught, and was killed because of these teachings. More importantly, throughout the movie we are shown how to pray properly and the true battle of good and evil (which is really harmless if we know this). All through the movie, we see the demons, Satan, the snake taunting Jesus and the important aspect here is how Jesus handled this. He gave no thought to evil and gave it no power, hence giving it no life. In the end, the metaphysical message is clear, if only we open our eyes.	5.0	Excellent	2010-09-15	3	1	2

How the story unfolds; the beautiful cinematography; the wonderful acting displayed on screen, all equal sheer perfection.Mel Gibson is to be honored for pulling off such an amazingly powerful and touching film basically all on his own. The hateful attacks that Gibson has had to endour, even to this day, because he dared to make this shining light among a sea of garbage, that is Hollywood, is a tragedy. The fact also, that this film was not recognized as the superb piece of art that it is by various award groups is also travesty. Frankly, it is understandable that Gibson may be bitter at some groups of people who were the biggest critics of his film for translating the Chistian Gospels for the screen.Everything about this movie is powerful and moving and if it doesn't have an impact or an effect on you then your soul must be dead.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1VONCVB0ANIEH	B. Wolf	"Problem 1: People who take on side immediately, only because they want to feel connected to the ""mass"" pop-culture audience.  This is no mystery or suprise; be it sports, fashion, cars, vacation spots, etc., people desire connection to larger things mostly out of dissapointment from their own failures, losses, and frustrations.  Gibson did not just pander to the religious-right bible thumping deep south fanatics, but what he really was after was placing blame square on someone's shoulders: seeing that Morgenstern's father had to beg Mel to cut out the blood be on your children part, it's pretty straightforward as to where he comes from and who he wishes to demonize.  Furthermore, Gibson is staunchly Roman Catholic, demanding that people follow him and keep prayers in the Latin tongue...umm, alright Mel, frankly that whole side to you is lame and passe; it's like saying to someone ""Hey, do these prayers my way or the highway!""  Mel really looked to place blame and rekindle old doubts and frictions between the Vatican and the Middle East; perhaps he had is way in that respect.  Main Point: Mel loves his Vatican and old religious practices and tried to turn the good Christians in America toward the side of the Vatican.  Result: very bad move.Problem 2: Religion or Race?  What is really more important and deeply engrained in the minds of most peoples?  Do you cast greater prejudice on grounds of physical features or religious affiliations?: Answer, race motivates on a deeper, actually realistic level as compared to phony religious claimings.  All of the worlds struggles, great conflicts, boil down to nationalistic pride and xenophobia more so than religious differences; e.g. the Persians allowing Jerusalem to be a site of worship for all peaceful peoples.  The real cancer on the Earth today is still the Vatican, which is itself pagan and by no means perfect (crusades, persecutions, papal bullying of nations including England and Germany by Romes legions, grand inquisition, etc.).  Will there ever be an African Pope?  Ha, not bloody likely.  Let's be real people, the world is determined and judged not by titles or teams (though commendment and numbers do help a cause) but by physical looks and similarities to our own ideals and preferences.  Main Point: Cut the nonsense, this world of ours is a cyclic sphere of national aspirations and individual coruption when faced with far-reaching decisions.  Result: we judge not by content of character or work ethic but by ideals.Problem 3: Religious difference as excuse for Racial decimation.  The Vatican, Mel's favorite big brother, that old institution in Rome once hellbent on ruling the world (how dare these thugs in robes who do little work...Karol Wojytola or John Paul II as an exception...and do absolutely nothing for science or human alleviation but would rather tell women how to live and enjoy old religious ceremonies tell whole nations and unique peoples such as Russia and China how to live) has been shown in the last few years (child molestation and financial fraudulence) to be highly corrupt and hypocritical.  How can Rome try to invade England and ruin Germany and deploy Spanish troops to Ireland hundreds of years ago, leaving death and destruction in their wake (Mel should have thought harder when making Braveheart, but being chauvanistic as he is, he forgot how the Scottish painted their faces blue and fought off Catholic Roman and Spanish troops trying to invande and take over the British Isles, not fight the English who have been a model nation to the world in regards to civilty and scientific thought...Newton ring a bell anyone?).  Main Point: for a nonspiritual demagoguery such as the Vatican to escape unscathed for what they've done to so many nations who were gentle and intellgent and progressive all until Catholic dogma invaded, they've really dodged quite a few bullets.  However, their time is running out.  Result: a world growing increasingly tired of relgious teachings as their ever evolving senses tell them of its use as a pretext for conquests and plundering.Problem 4: As the brilliant Harvard professor Samuel Huntington has portrayed in his books on clashes of cultures and remaking world order, the world is by no means stable.  Not even after civil wars, revolutions, world wars, coups....none have secured the longlasting peace so hoped for by many, but not all (e.g. thugs, gangs, criminals, dictators - the less intelligent real-life monsters of past and present).  The world of tommrrow is not one of religion (even south america is growing apart thanks to hugo chavez's finger pointing at america) but one of national identity...ironically, that has always been the case.  Main Point: integration and segregation continue to pull at eachother, fracturing America more than ever before.  The unrealistic thoughts of everyone ""liking"" each other and just ""getting along"" are over, and have never been much more than false words for false security.  Result: An America and Western world that wakes up to the threats from the east, a new China that could be peaceful partner or worst nightmare, and countries forced to take extreme measures due to unwanted influences (i.e. muslims taking over London's streets, France becoming a barnyard bash that doesn't work, and China wanting to remain a cultural empire unhinged by capitalism.  The world will survive and grow as old ideas of how to do just such collapse across the globe.  Dogma fails while reason, service, and a new humanity to all neighbors, be they of any race, flourishes.  The Herculean Man-God ideal fades as people grow tired of God being white, black, asian, green, blue, etc.  The world matures, people relax spiritually, and scientific advance continues to do some good, some bad.  As John Lennon so poetically said, sometimes we all have to ""Let It Be."""	2.0	Absolute Truths Abound!?	2005-05-27	21	7	14
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1SP38JKYFFVJS	Caesar M. Warrington	"What more can be said about this movie? It has become a symbol of adoring love for so many (and judging from the spitefully pornographic scribblings of a few ""reviewers"" also one of intense hatred).All of us who were raised in Christian households, who went to Catholic schools have heard and read the words: ""scourging"" and ""crucifixion."" We've seen re-enactments of these evils in Passion plays, we also watched them acted out in previous movies on the Life of Jesus. But it took Mel Gibson and a fantastic actor like Jim Caviezel to graphically display the horror of what these truly were. Some people call this movie disgusting, some call it a gorefest. Well, that is what Gibson intended to film. Scourging went beyond punishment, it is the rendering of the victim into a symbol of broken and torn submission. Crucifixion displays the victim as a symbol for all our various fears of death and pain. A man crucified was a man who was bound, broken, bleeding, slowly suffocated and totally helpless to the fangs and beaks, claws and talons of every nearby carrion eater. Gibson forces us (the spoiled and the complacent) to witness this. I thank Gibson for such a realistic display of barbarity and evil for he shows us what we all are truly capable of doing.As for all those Chicken Littles in the Jewish community who feared we were going to see this film, then exit the movie theatres and go on a pogrom spree, they owe Mel Gibson a much deserved apology."	4.0	A True Icon	2005-08-30	9	6	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3LX5ELWX6HYK6	Caligula II.	Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good, too, but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all, using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly, casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus, stroke of a genius, this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence, but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes, which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17.	5.0	BEST RELIGIOUS MOVIE EVER MADE	2014-02-06	2	1	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AFLPMS5K3DZL5	calmly	The depiction of the violence did not seem gratuitous. Anti-Semitism was not apparent to me. The film seemed geared to all Christians, not just evangelicals. Also, non-Christians of any kind seem like they might find value in what was shown. Gibson's re-creation seemed largely faithful to the Gospel accounts and not in itself divisive or sectarian.Gibson's effort seems entirely sincere and worthy of respect. I'm surprised at some of the hostile reactions to this film and to Gibson. I had stayed away from the film until now due to many negative media reviews. The violence was certainly unpleasant to watch but I didn't have to turn my head away at all or feel manipulated. Gibson's direction seemed not only responsible but  a contribution. Yet many of the media reviews of this film seem to have been unduly negative. I'm glad I finally ignored the media reviews and took a look for myself.That said, the focus on the sacrificial theme is open to serious question. Although concerns about violence or anti-Semitism by reviewers seem exaggerated, any concern seems well-placed about the focus on the death as sacrifice. A concern about how that might be being manipulated nowadays also seems due.	4.0	A lot of apologies seem due to Mel Gibson	2005-03-21	25	18	7

After I saw it in the theater, I has a different view.  I Thought it was a wonderfully done. It was a awesome depiction of the sacrifice Jesus made for the us. Because he loved us so much, he didn't want to see us all perish, but wants us all to be with him and the father in heaven.  But we are sinful by nature and there is penaty for sin, but the only penalty is death. we would have had to all perish because the debt that is owed is far too great. So Jesus came to earth as a man to make a bridge for us to the father God, and also had to die for everyone so we would have an oppertunity to be with the father. Jesus didn't want to die...I think he was actually scared and asked the father if there was another way. It's an extraordinary story whether you believe it or not.I've heard a lot of people argu that he was beaten too much in the movie and there was too much blood, I actually kind of agree; however, I'm sure it was a gruesome death and it probably hurt pretty bad.My biggest argument with the movie is the few things that mel gibson threw in that were kind of goofy.  ex. The CG demon, the crow on the cross, satan with the baby, and the monster children.I think mel gibson is off his rocker and is pretty much crazy. Althought he can make a good movie, the guy is a paranoid crazy.But because of all the controversy of this film, I think it grants the right for your view.

Many people don't wish to understand that this movie is not about Jesus being tortured, but what he went through in his final moments on earth. Many also state that it is impossible that one can handle such beating and still be able to walk with a huge cross on its back. I did my thoroughly investigation after I watched this film for the first time, browsing through websites from people that have studied such brutal events like the crucifixion. I even watched a special documentary on the Discovery Channel when this movie was released in the theaters, regarding Jesus deaths and all events he went through and they all concluded that it was not pretty to witness it. Back in those times many people were crucified and they had to endure torturous procedures before being killed in the cross. And Jesus, convicted for `swearing' he was the son of God, might of actually tolerated a bit more than the usual.It was a movie that took a lot of bravery and valor from Mel Gibson to make, and that courage paid off with this great film which includes terrific acting and cinematography.  `The Passion of the Christ' does contain a lot of violence and gore, something one must have in mind if they are easily offended by that subject.	5.0	Powerful!	2010-02-17	1	0	1

In 2003, Passion producer Mel Gibson, was accused of every sort of malice from the Hollywood elite that is hostile to this movie, Christianity, and Western Civilization in general.The movie is the story of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and it is filmed in a color tone that reminds the viewer of a Renaissance painting of the same subject.  It is also unique in that the dialogue is spoken in Latin and Aramaic, the languages of the time.  Greek is left out although it was the lingua franca of the Eastern Roman Empire.The movie make a point to emphasize the various smaller Saints that were part of the story.  For example, Pontius Pilatus' wife, an Orthodox Saint, is favorably featured.  An Ethiopian servant is also shown as receptive to the message of Christ.The movie is graphic, torture and blood is featured, however the affair is artfully done.  Violence, after all is a major part of art.Most movies pushed from Hollywood is nothing more than ""dreck,"" but this work is high art melding the classic works of da Vinci, Albrecht D&uuml;rer, Rembrandt, and Michelangelo with the modern medium of cinema.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3AVQKK0XMF75F	Carmen	"As a devout Catholic, I looked forward to this film a great deal.I was not at all disappointed.I think it needs to be said that while most of the film is true to the Gospels, this is still what I would consider a work of art--it is Mel Gibson's very deeply personal interpretation. That doesn't lessen the impact of the film for me.The experience of this film was a very personal one for me as the viewer. None of the unrealistic 1950/60's films' bloodless and passionless depictions, none of the Mary looking like an fair Irish lass out of a holy card--barely registering emotion at the foot of the cross, none of the WASPY looking blonde blue eyed actors, or aloof Jesus....Thank goodness! It's about time someone showed the more personal side of this greatest story ever told. And that would include a large amount of blood and pain and suffering--that's what ""passion"" means--and that's what Mel achieved: THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. THIS IS WHAT HE DID FOR YOU.Be mindful of some scenes if you haven't noticed them directly: Veronica's veil, the Last Supper/Crucifixation scenes as Mass, and the face of Mary--looking into the audience as she holds her dead son at the foot of the cross--have you noticed? Are you aware? She is directly looking at the audience as if to say, ""Now that He has done this for you, what are you going to do about it?""I am thankful to Mr Gibson for having the courage and the tenacity to see this through.It was not anti-semitic either. If there are people around still subscribing to that mistaken view, they are coming from both ignorance and their own particular prejudices. There were no pogroms, no one was hurt or killed, none of that happened because of this film.Instead, a few criminals who had seen the film came forward to confess their crimes--the film had that kind of impact on them.Now that it's on DVD I expect more good will come from this masterpiece as many more people have a chance to see it.It is now the standard by which all religious films will be compared.

I saw the movie in the theatre and was so moved and heartbroken that I (like most there) just cried.  Though I have been familiar with Jesus'  story for so long, I never really FELT his sacrifice as real and shocking as the movie made it.  This movie made me really &#34;feel&#34; the pain and anguish we are told Christ experienced for our salvation, though it was felt through watching the actor's experience.  Someday, when the time seems &#34;right&#34;, I will view it again to see if it affects me the same.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1N37L78ZREG8Y	Carolyn Paetow	Since Mel Gibson meant this movie as both an artistic endeavor and a manifestation of religio-historicity, any examination of the film's merits should involve both of these aspects.As cinematic art, the movie is a work of absolute beauty.  Moodily atmospheric at times, wrenchingly earthy at others, it is superbly casted, acted, and directed.  Its oft criticized bloody torturousness is the primary reason it is so effective in demonstrating how Jesus's love and forgiveness survives such astounding horrendousnous.As a docudramatic undertaking, the film is simply the embodiment of Gibson's Christian beliefs as expressed through traditional Catholic imagery.  As with all movies based on actual events, the story is fleshed out with typical human actions and reactions.  It must be stressed, however, that Gibson does not depict known personages in non-historical ways.  If Pilate, for instance, is shown as equivocating, then that is the way he actually was, according to the Gospels.  And as for bad representations of Jews?  Jesus was a Jewish man in a Jewish nation with Jewish followers.  Some of his countrymen loved him, some hated him, and some were ambivalent.  Gibson very clearly shows this, as anyone can see who pays attention to the action.  As well, some of the Romans are sadistic brutes, and some are decent people reluctantly carrying out duties.  The only being that truly gets bashed is Satan, so if his admirers want to complain, they have reason.	5.0	The Greatest Story's Greatest Telling	2004-02-25	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A14LV2SJSR3102	Cartimand	"I'm not a particularly religious person. I, fact, I tend to switch channels when the ""God slot"" comes on the TV. This, coupled with rumours of an anti-Semitic bias (certainly untrue IMHO) and no particular fondness for Mel Gibson (I regarded Braveheart and The Patriot as historically inaccurate anglophobic nonsense), put me off seeing this movie at the cinema.  My lady went to see it though and found it an immensely powerful experience and said I just /had/ to watch it.So I got the DVD, sat in my comfiest armchair surrounded by my 5.1 speakers, cup of tea at my side, and pressed play.Two hours later, the tea had gone cold and, with tears in my eyes, I felt utterly emotionally drained and profoundly moved in a way that no film has affected me before.  For that reason alone I could not award any less than five stars.Other reviewers here have already given detailed accounts of the screenplay and, as this is very much a movie that does /exactly/ what it says on the tin, I won't comment further on the story.  The consensus appears to be though that The Passion is very faithful to the Gospel accounts, although Gibson clearly does take some liberties with the personification of Satan (Rosalinda Celantano as a unsettlingly androgenous figure, which made me think of Marilyn Manson for some weird reason!).Magnificently filmed - from sweeping landscapes of a beautifully recreated holy land, to the excruciating detail of Christ's suffering, complemented by a powerful score and impeccable acting (most notably Hristo Shopov's oscar-worthy Pilate), this is a triumph, which you don't have to be a devout Christian to feel moved by.A unique cinematic experience, but one of such intensity that I don't know when I will watch The Passion again."	5.0	I certainly wasn't entertained, but oh boy, was I moved	2005-04-04	17	11	6

This is certainly the case with Mel Gibson. Mel wishes himself he were Jesus, and after making this movie he has definitely received the acclamation he desired.I thought the cinematography was good. The stars are for that and the acting. The story was boring, and it was non-stop blood and violence. This film made me even more sickened by religion and what it has done to people. For those who believe and blame Jews for the death of Jesus, you wouldn't have your precious Christ if it was not for them. So you should be thanking them for it instead of throwing stones. Anyways, I don't believe the story was accurate at all, and according to history,NOT THE BIBLE- Pilate was malicious and not at all sympathetic and forgiving as Mel made him out to be in the film. The Romans had the control here-not the Jews. I think this film wrongfully portrayed the Jews as being in control-having authority, and being murderers-WOW! A totally anti-Jewish  ""Jews control the world"" viewpoint (which is totally fabricated).I believe wholeheartedly in freedom of speech-and Mel is entitled to do whatever he wants in his films-but that does not mean I have to like it. What I find completely contradictory of Fundamentalist Christians is that they will go to lengths to condemn violence in films-and yet this film, is considered a masterpiece. What hypocrisy!

""The Passion of the Christ"" is, I think, first and foremost, a movie.  It is not proof that the Christians hate Jews, nor is it an exact account of what really happened.  I think Mel Gibson understood that the best way to tell this story was to use abstract Bible imagery (i.e. Jesus crushing the serpant with his heel).  Jesus probably didn't REALLY crush a snake with his foot, but it is a powerful way of illustrating the point that he did not give in to temptation.  Also, people are complaining because the movie only shows the crucifixtion.  If you actually look at things about the movie before it was released, that is all it claimed to show.  It was never said to be about the life of Christ.  It is about the death of Christ, and the PASSION (get it?) that he had for humanity!

It's part art and message, and as one going in an art gallery, one must interpret the piece according to what he or she knows and feels.Viewers not very well-versed or even halfway-versed in the relevant Biblical scriptures will not understand that this is not based on some made up Hollywood storyline with a Hollywood plot.  Viewers having some knowledge or indepth knowledge of the scriptures will see this as Gibson's close rendering of the scriptures which have existed before and will exist beyond our own time.Personally, while I found the brutality harsh and realistic, I came away from the movie with a sense of of humility and the need to show my fellow human brother and sisters(even my enemies) love.  I would caution parents and other sensitive individuals (because children are not the only ones who can't handle such realistic brutality in a mature way, the message itself should not be cloaked though) to think about whether the individual in question would be able to handle this.From an artistic standpoint, the filmography is moving and rich, and the actors played their parts well and in keeping with the personalities and character of the historical individuals.Some people will see this movie just to say they've seen it, some will see it with the pre-existing ulterior motive of making light of it and the message, some will see it with an open-mind and heart, and some will see it because of their personal relationship with Christ.

Alas, I find little about this film that is likeable or meritable.First, the makeup and prosthetics were lamentably bad! The film had the feel of a concoction. For me, it lacked depth, gravity, artistic impact, rather like watching someone paint by numbers, or else place ingredients into a jar and shake them up, hoping they will come out arranged in some artistically rewarding order. Where was the inspiration?The one scene I liked- and I liked it very much- was when Jesus was at home and working as a carpenter. It boded so well...Alternatives?

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	I decided to give this film 3 stars, exactly in the middle of the rating system, because there were scenes of great beauty and insight and then there were scenes of torture that were excessive and made me question the motives of the film makers.After reading many of the reviews of this film, I am reflecting on the conception of the atonement in Christianity and whether this film supported or undermined that basic theme that undergirds Christian belief.The atonement is a process whereby a perfect sacrifice is made to God the Father for the sins of mankind. Since there is no perfection except in God, then God himself must be sacrificed, and this is done through the death of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ, who is one with the Father and the Holy Ghost.  Thus mankind's sins would remain upon us unless this perfect atonement is made, offering the possibility of life everlasting in heaven with God.So the question arises, is all this torture necessary for the atonement to occur?  Must Christ have experienced this incredible gory and terrible torture to take the sins of the whole world upon him?  As the sacrificial lamb, must he endure considerable pain and loss of blood, to take the sins of the world on his shoulders? I think not. It is the death of the innocent lamb that is the sacrifice and atonement for the sins of the whole world, not the endurance of the considerable bloody torture that leads to the atonement. It is the giving of his life, a pure, perfect, sacrifice that is the atonement for all of mankind's sins.So this leads to the question of why so much blood and gore?  Was Gibson trying to say that mankind is so terrible that we do not deserve the sacrifice and atonement? Well there is no question there for surely we know mankind not to be deserving of complete and perfect grace upon our own merits, either as a species or individually. Was there some commentary about the religious and political establishment being made by the torture scenes?  Well, it was organized religion and organized political oppression that together brought about the torture and death, to be sure, but is Gibson trying to say that organized religion in partnership with an oppressive central government is capable of great cruelty to the innocent, even unto God in a human state of existence?  I never got the impression that the meaning of the film and sequence of scenes was really strategically thought through and thus in some ways this is only a terribly vicious, painful, gory snuff film with little reflection on the meaning of the sacrifice and atonement which are central concepts in Christianity and far more important than the nasty beating scenes where the flesh is literally pulled off the back and ribs of Christ.Does a sensationalistic portrayal of the passion of Christ do a service or disservice to Christianity? It really does neither for the movement of the Christ goes far beyond our ability to conceptualize the vast mystery of why atonement is necessary and why God himself, in the human form of Jesus, must make that sacrifice. For muddled thought and purpose, this film only gets 3 stars.	3.0	What does the atonement mean?	2009-10-06	4	2	2

"I went and saw the movie at the theater and I loved it, I could not wait till it came out on dvd, but now here I am still waiting.  Why?  Because while every one else will rave about Gibson's marketing I think he made one of the sneakiest underhanded moves known to Hollywood.  Mel released the dvd with no special features at all, not even a director commentary. Why?  Because he thinks it will sell without it (and probably will), and then when every copy has sold, a year or two later he will release the ""Special Edition"" and make even more money.  Trying to get every Christian on the face of the planet to spend as much money on you, well that doesn't sound very Christian does it.  So now maybe I will boycot it, and if he's lucky maye some day I will forget how mad I was at his marketing and buy it... I don't know.  But Mel, here are some tips for you:1) Special Features are not special anymore they are common, hopefully you will loose money for this2) While obviously you know the last 12 hours of Christ's life you have forgotten the rest or just ignore it.  Trying to suck every last cent from a Christian's pocket isn't very Christian3) If you ask your preacher, maybe he will remind you of something Jesus said about how hard it would be for the rich to get past the front gates in Heaven. Something about the eye of a needle.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2WSWL714Q0N1W	"C. ""Corky"" Lichtenstein"	"As a Jew whose parents were both survivors of Auschwitz, I tend to agree with comedian Jackie Mason when he said (around the time this turkey of a film was being released into theatres) ""Mel Gibson is dipping his hands into the blood of the six million"".  I am shocked that there are not more reviews on here which take note of and condemn this film's anti-Semitism.  I suppose that in some respect I should thank Mel Gibson. He brought me back to G-d.  My G-d.  Our G-d.  Who was and is One, and transcendent; unable to be represented by images , and ,  G-d help those who claim it,  has never and will never bear any sort of ""offspring"", even if this is supposed to have been done somehow ""immaculately"".  There have been many false prophets and Messiahs in our Jewish history.  I for one, as his fellow Jew, do not feel that Yeshua Bin N'zaret (as he is called, by his true name, in this film) WAS even truly a false Messiah.  I do not believe that the man ever claimed to BE the literal ""son"" , or ""offspring"", of G-d.  Having been raised a devout Jew he would have realized the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that idea. He would have known that such an idea was (and still is) a purely pagan type of belief.  So, the rhetorical question, ""WWJD?""  In my opinion, what he would do, were he somehow to be raised magically from the dead and shown this world and told of this religion, ""Christ""-ianity,  he would be appalled first and foremost.  He would be appalled at the sight of swarms of people (non-Jews the lot of them) worshiping HIM as the literal ""son"" of G-d, giving devotions and praying to him in the form of graven images of himself in his death throes upon that most cruel Roman instrument of execution.  He would probably want to find the nearest shul and prostrate himself in prayer to his G-d for the redemption of his Jewish people, and ask for forgiveness for having inadvertently soiled hallowed Judaic tradition in such a way.  And, we must ask ourselves, what if he were to learn of the many pogroms, and the Holocaust ?  His own people being driven out, being brutally persecuted and murdered, oftentimes ""in his name"" or because ""they"" had ""killed him"". It might simply be enough to make the man wish he had never been born into this world at all.  The fact of the matter is that the man upon whom this movie is based did not intend to found ANY new religion distinct from his Judaism at all.  He was NOT, and this is quite paradoxical and hard to take in (from a goyish point of view) I realize, and would not have approved of anyone being, a ""Christ""-ian.  The Jesus cult of today is simply a Judaized paganism, ""Judaism for Gentiles"".  NOT a true monotheism.  At least we must hand it to Islam that it is a true monotheism and believes in the one transcendent imageless G-d.Going back to the question of ""WWJD?"",  Yeshua the man, Yeshua the Palestinian Jew from some two-thousand years ago, would probably have much more in common today with, would probably feel quite at home with , the Satmar Hasid strolling down Lee Street in South Williamsburg in Brooklyn, as opposed to the gentile American Southerner, of Scotch-Irish descent, who eats barbecued ribs on the Fourth of July and has a bumper sticker that reads ""Jesus Saves"" on his pickup truck.  Odds are, in fact, Yeshua the man would quite possibly not even want to have anything to do with these ""meshuga goyim"" (to use an old affectionate Yiddish/Hebrew phrase for them). Yeshua the man would, quite possibly, view these ""Christ-ians"" as nothing more than ""barbarian pagans"", untouchable ""idolaters"" and ""eaters of swine"".  THAT is in FACT what ""Jesus"" would do.  If one wants to worship the one true G-d, then one should do so.  But to do that one would have to convert to Judaism and become a Jew, like  ""Jesus"" was,  AT heart and through-and-through.  For G-d CANNOT be approached through crazydom,  through meshugadom,  through pagan ideas about his having borne a ""son"" with some promiscuous teenage Jewess from the Galilee.

John 3:16 HE loves you and this is a portrayel of the extent of His love. Even though this movie is gory, the beatings were actually much worse in real life for Jesus, (the bible says the He was marred beyong recognition and that He was marred more then any man ever has or or will be) I suggest that all watch this.

I am a huge fan of Scorses's The Last Tempation of Christ.  This Movie was INTENSE to say the least.  I read some of the other reviews on the film comparing it to mindless horror flicks.  The movie was filled with violence.  So much so that perhaps it was hard to follow the story line.  However, Realisticly we are blinded by stories of a man who suffered and died for our sins.  If you look closely beyond the violence we see a people controled by a religious few.  The Romans at the time struggled with the Jews who resented being ruled by a group who whorshiped many pagan gods.  The Roman govenor talks about his struggles with the Jews, and fearing an uprising condemns Jesus to death.  The Romans, in oreder to have more control over the Jews, built the Jews a temple.  Jesus makes little reference to the temple and says that it will be destroyed and built up again.  The reason he speaks out against the temple is for many reasons but more simply because it was a source of control.  The Zealots used it as a base inwhich they could control the Jewish people and the Romans then had the Zealots in the palm of their hand.  Jesus was a threat to the Zealots power because he challenged the very thing that gave the Zealots power.  As far as this movie being anti-semitc, I only saw a corrupt theocracy attempt to rid itself of a person who challenged its power.  It is a theme that has been used by powerful people still to this day!  I felt that to simply see this movie is not enough.  One needs to have an understanding about the complexity of the times.  There was a lot of struggle within the Jewish population, between the rich and poor, between the Jews and the Romans.  That struggle sets the stage for one of the most talked about, argued about, understood and misunderstood, events of our time; the death of the Christ.	5.0	Awesome Movie	2004-02-25	2	1	1

The camera movements were awkward, the editing horrid, the slow-motion unbearable, and the lighting was often too dark to even guess at what was occurring.The only thing this movie made me feel (and this is my personal opinion) is disappointment.  I was disappointed in human kind.  From this retelling of Jesus' story I realized how his name is used in vain every day.  Jesus' teachings went completely ignored.  We are no better today than those who crucified him.  Perhaps that is a bit cynical, but it is what I got from the film.

I'd bet that it's not likely to be topped by anything anytime soon.  Not from horror.  Not from dark fantasy.  Not from sci-fi.  No, this one will pledge it's vision into my skull for a long time even if I never watch it again.The ""Passion"" is probably partly based on less extreme Passion plays that are featured around the world as a commemoration of Christ's death.  It is clear, though, that Gibson went for the throat with this film.  There is no question here.  You either sympathize with the devastated Christ or you have no soul.  That's the message of this film.  The plight of Judas Iscariot is no less powerful than that of his Master becoming the victim of circumstances that he could not forsee in his greed and power hungry heart.The fleshed out depictions of the spiritual forces of evil add a wickedness to the story that draws a clear disinction between Christ and the great Accuser, Satan, who is played by a woman to give the ancient rival of God a clearly feminine cast.  Not sure why Gibson felt that was necessary, but it is visually stunning.The beating of Christ, however, is the most gruesome feature of this film.  No one below the age of 17 should be allowed to see it.  It is so real and cruel that it makes one wonder if the human race is worth saving at all, if it cannot do any better than this.  The wounds are horrid.  The blood is all too convincing.After this, the crucifixion is almost anti-climatic.  Almost.  Gibson manages to stage the culmination of the story with gruesome and dour aplomb.  He manages to make Christ seem and feel real against any doubt that might capture the heart.  Excellently acted and directed this movie is one for the ages."	5.0	Visual depictions that hammer at the conscience.	2008-01-18	4	2	2

Good Friday was an incredible sacrifice for mankind, and it is good for us to understand the suffering that went on.  But, we don't want to forget the point was the gift he left us, a chance to have relationship through him with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  Also, when Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane there were Angels there with him, not Satan.

FLETCHER ""movie nut"""	"Growing up Roman Catholic(half italian) and being force-fed the story of Christ on the Cross, it was easy to discount the suffering done in our name.  I remember thinking, ""I can't wait til this is over, I've got a softball game today"".This film, for me, has brought new meaning to the 2000 year old story, which for myself and my friends, was a chore to endure rather than a gift to be celebrated.In my 39 years on this planet I never even once, to my shame, really gave a thought to what this lowly Jewish carpenter endured for our benefit.To all the antisemitic complaints and antisemitic people who misunderstand and/or misuse this Holy story to further their own hatred, I say, ""Shame on you!"".(stands on soapbox)Yes, the Romans crucified Christ.  Yes, if my ancestors had anything to do with the crucifixion, I bear some responsibility.  Yes this was all done with the Jewish clergy's(READ AS: ""A very select few Jewish people's"") consent, wishes, and blessing for no other reason than to maintain their power and control over their Jewish brothers and sisters.It is important to remember that Christ was a Jew. And not just a 'goes to temple on holidays' type of Jew, He was an extremely devout Jew. Most of His disciples and followers were also Jewish.  Paul, the founder of the Catholic Church, was a Jew.  Anyone with a functioning brain who is a true believer in Christ's teachings would:1. not blame an entire people for the misdeeds of the few in power.  To do so would make them just as guilty as Osama blaming all of the people in the U.S. for the perceived crimes of the government2. at the forefront of Christ's teachings was forgiveness.  So many hypocrites claim to follow Christ, however fall short when it comes to forgiveness.  Bear in mind as you watch this film and are completely disgusted at the torture this Son of God is enduring, that when all was said and done, He forgave, as He hanged in agony awaiting death, He forgave ALL involved.  For myself and anyone else who calls themselves Christian, to not forgive would be to completely disregard all in which we claim to believe.(steps down from soapbox)In closing, I'd like to say that I found this film to be a true work of art as it provoked thought and debate on a subject that has divided people on this planet for over 2000 years.  As a Catholic, this film has both renewed and strengthened my faith in ways that 39 years of going to Mass failed to do.  I would have given the movie 5 stars, but I feel that their should have been a at least as much emphasis on Christ's forgiveness as on the torture endured.You probably won't enjoy this film, it's powerful imagery and blatant violence will probably disturb you.  But everyone, both Christian and non-Christians alike, should see this film.C. Fletcher"	4.0	Former Altar Boy Finds New Meaning In Stations of the Cross	2004-08-31	10	8	2

I was born and raised as a Catholic and over the years, my faith in God and Christ has always been strong. This past weekend, my mother, father, and I took ourselves to the theater to see this film. After the movie had ended, I felt my faith grow so much stronger than ever. The movie is very, very graphic and gory, but that only goes to show you that that Jesus actually suffered that badly. Seeing how this innocent man suffered brought immediate tears to my eyes. All I wanted was to meet the real Jesus and just give a huge hug.I cannot say for sure if I liked this film or not, but I gave it five stars because of it's outstanding direction that was done by the famous Mel Gibson. James Caviezel gave an unbelievably incredible performance as Christ himself. If you are a Catholic who has not yet seen this film, I do recommend that you go out to see this film. If you are not a Catholic, I highly recommend that you go out to see this film. But I must warn you all, Catholic or not, if you do decide to see the film, I can assure you that you will be in tears throughout the entire movie.

From the beginning, I knew I was going to see a movie the likes of which I had never seen (and I've seen many). First, there were no previews at all(I kid you not). The lights went dark, and it went right into the movie. It opened with the passage ""But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed (Isaiah 53:5)"".  I couldn't believe that I was watching a movie that began with no previews, nor could my girlfriend.  If that is an example of the seriousness with which this movie is taken, I don't know what is.  I'm not going to go into the details of the violence. I'm sure you've all heard of it by now.  I can guarantee that it is without a doubt the most graphic movie you have ever seen.  But, it was an excellent movie.  I am not a religous person AT ALL, but this film made me appreciate Christ.  It is well worth the money to own the DVD.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A34T30OCVVSV7F	Chad L Summers	"What we've heard so far from the critics is a mingled version of jealousy, negativism, racial animosity and atheistic reaction. But on the whole, their voices trail off into little muffled cries and can be easily compared to the petty whining of a child.It is not difficult to see that we've had an outbreak of immediate public reaction (of innumerous proportion) to the film's content and religious voice...which apparently has spoken louder than all our words and also louder than Hollywood had anticipated. The fact of the matter is, this motion picture has succeeded indefinitely in reaching into the hearts of mankind with a force so powerful, it has overtaken us. Why do you think all the controversy and non-stop talk? This film alone has prompted it, which could only mean that it is undeniably of the extra-ordinary.Yes, we have brutal graphic violence excessively throughout the production. Yes, we have disturbing images. But was not this on the warning label? There seems to be a surprise coming from our audience, which is ironic to me. It was the director's intention to portray historical realism, something very much differing to the ""pretty"" crucifixions we've witnessed on screen in the past...which have been anything but real. Again, as I mentioned earlier, this is not usual but extra-ordinary. Historical Roman crucifixions aren't clean, pleasant, or by any means enjoyable to watch. Did not the preview and synopsis explain that this film was a depiction of the final hours of the life of Christ? ...with an ""R"" rating attached? I mean, what exactly did our audience interpret Christ's final hours to be and entail? To say that this film did not give us prior notice is akin to a sign reading, ""Caution: Wet Floor is Slippery"", and someone falls down, then tries to sue for physical damages. I am somewhat confused; can someone explain this to me? But one thing I am certain of is the fact that this film has given many a big dose of reality medication, which I feel is about time.And a FYI to those who feel that the film has reflected prejudice feeling toward the Jew or to Jewish culture in general (i.e. that this group alone was responsible for the death of Christ), let me clarify a valuable point to you. The director himself has openly declared to the public that his film was solely to depict Christ's suffering and passion for the world and for all cultures within it...Jews and all. It was not to point fingers at who in particular was responsible. Mel's intent was simply to follow the events as they were written in the Scriptures. Any individual coming against the film in the regard of it being anti-Semitic needs to re-study the 4 Gospels, for obviously they lack prior knowledge of what is contained in them. All I am saying is that Gibson did his homework; I don't know about anyone else. He even added that ""those who are saying these things aren't coming against me or my movie, but against the 4 Gospels of the New Testament."" Yes, the Jews may have cried out for Christ's crucifixion 2,000 years ago, but Mel let us know that ""because of our sins, we ALL have a part in being 'spiritually' responsible and guilty for putting Christ on the cross.""Excellent movie. ""Must-see"" film."	5.0	LET THEM WHINE. IT STILL CAN'T STOP THE FILM'S MAGNITUDE.	2004-03-08	20	13	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2DE249NY4SMSN	Chad Taylor	"It is sometimes difficult to imagine why and especially how Christ suffered and died in order to make peace between God and Man. This movie tries to display that suffering so that people understand what He experienced.  This movie is overly graphic in the depiction of the violence against Him, but brings home the reality of Sin in the Christian context.  Sin cuts Man off from God; Christ mission was to seal that breach. ""Look, Mother,"" he says, I make things right.""Although I found the Aramaic initially annoying, Gibson paced and placed the subtitles so that you could follow along without missing a scene.  It seems the choice of language is two-fold: one to appropriately depict the language of the times and also, I believe to keep us slightly distant from such a painful display - as though we had some way to look back at it all.  Gibson was extremely brave because the scourging and crucifixtion are extremely painful to experience and could have sent people away in droves.  However, I think Gibson tries to focus on the purpose of His suffering.  Satan (wonderfully protrayed as a mocking amorphous being) confronts Christ in the garden and tells him that NO ONE MAN can take on the sins of the world  - and that's why such a display of violence: each lash, each drop of blood, each thorn, each nail, is sin upon sin visited upon Him so that Man would not suffer separation from God.  That being said, comments from Protestant nay-sayers who revile Gibson's message as being overly Catholic only show their bitterness toward Catholicism and miss Christ's message just as the Reformatists did so long ago - submission."	4.0	Painful, Violent, Heart wrenching, but with a Purpose...	2004-08-20	6	0	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AB34G6VKP28L	"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic"""	"""He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, and by his wounds we are healed...""The words from Isaiah, written 700 years before the crucifixion, are the only introduction to this remarkable film. On a moonlit night the clouds part and bathe a figure crying out in a garden, his soul wracked with torment, in white light. The man is the Messiah, Jesus, who only days before was welcomed into Jerusalem as a holy man and king. His disciples are asleep nearby, despite his pleadings for them to stay awake and pray with him. From the shadows a figure observes, mesmerizing but evil to the very marrow of his soul. The shadow is Satan and deception and selfishness are his tools as he urges the Christ to give up this road, to let mankind atone for their own sins. But Jesus refuses to submit to the seductive lies of the deceiver and symbolically crushes Satan's pet serpent under his heel.In the Jewish Temple Judas stands before the High Priests. He has been promised thirty pieces of silver for betraying the Christ. The coins scatter around him on the floor and he hastily bends to pick them up. Torches illuminate the night as he leads them to the Gardens to arrest the Messiah. The disciples resist but Jesus comes willingly into the Temple Court. At the moment of his arrest Mary, his mother, awakens in torment, certain something terrible is happening. John has managed to escape and comes to fetch her and Mary Magdalene. They are not allowed inside the counsel but there Jesus is questioned, slandered, spit on, and sent to the Romans in order to plead for his execution. Pontius Pilate's wife Claudia has awoken from a nightmare and begs him not to sentence the ""king of the Jews"" to death. But Jesus has been sent to earth to bear the burden of sin for mankind. The penalty is persecution, merciless beating, and eventual crucifixion.One of the most emotionally disturbing but profoundly touching films to come out in a long time, The Passion of the Christ has arisen great controversy, and for good reason. Between the themes and the brutality, there is a lot not to like... and a lot to appreciate both as a believer, and as a scholar of history. This film is visually stunning to the point of being overwhelming. Its subject matter is extremely dark but mesmerizing. The slow arch of the bag of coins as it flies through the air into Judas' outstretched hand... a close up of Mary Magdalene as Jesus cries ""It is finished""... the tears on her face, the wind slowly caressing her hair... the captivating but disturbing image of Satan watching Jesus flogged nearly to death with great pleasure, holding a child-like demon in his arms. These characters are real. You empathize with the good and hate the bad. For an instant when he first appears you're mesmerized by Satan, wondering if the apparition is an angel... but then you realize the truth. The malice in its eyes, the cold deception of its words. Jesus is someone you instinctively love. You pity Him, feel each of the blows... flashbacks illuminate moments of His extraordinary life. The acting is so good you don't even think about the actors... it's too real. I loved the enhancement on James Caviezel's eyes... they are absolutely spellbinding, full of love throughout torment.Catholics will appreciate the symbolism rampant throughout, as well as nods to traditional Catholic teachings and the writing of Josephus. There are mild deviations from scripture and a few of the writers' additions are unexplained, but the film is one we should all see at least once. If you're a Christian, you need to understand The Sacrifice, and if you're not... you need to understand what we believe."	4.0	Powerful & Thought-Provoking	2012-03-22	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AB9WCN34TY8CV	Charles Sutherland	"This movie is very interesting indeed.  It does not follow the gospel stories strictly, as anyone who reads the Bible will be able to tell.  There is artistic license, that is brought in from the longer tradition of the church.  For those who know the stories from pilgrimage times, all of the pieces of following the trail of Christ are there.  In some South American countries doing this reenactment is still very popular around Easter.For those of you who don't like subtitles, this movie might be confusing.  I found it hard to follow some of the characters, since they aren't named very often.  Also, a friend of mine who knows Latin didn't think that the subtitles translated all of the dialogue, but that might be a matter of interpretation, too.  The character of Satan is quite a unique creation, not at all what one might expect in the biblical tale.In the end, this is a movie that whatever the viewers want to see in it, they will.  If they want to see anti-Semitism, they can find it, but it isn't a hit-them-over-the-head kind.  If they want to find a fictional recreation, they will.  If they want to find a passionate and spiritual experience, they can find that too.  It is a movie open to a lot of interpretation.  It wasn't too spiritual an experience for me, but others in the theater seemed to get that feeling from it all.  I did find it fascinating, though.This can be a disturbing film, because many of us are used to cleaned-up Sunday school type of stories about Jesus, and this is the ""real thing"" so to speak about the agony and violence.  It bothered me a little bit, but in the end I guess that is really what was happening.It is an interesting film, and I hope at the end of the day it will make people want to read about the real thing."	4.0	Interesting portrayal	2004-03-12	4	3	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A14LSVZHC1XS75	Che Broadnax	"This is not going to be a tirade about religion.  In fact, this review has nothing to do with religion or faith or Christianity or God.  This review will simply talk about The Passion of the Christ as a film.A film which I feel will not be terribly well received by non-Christians or film afficianados.Let me start with the most glaring shortcoming.  For those who are not intimately familiar with Christian theology, the movie does very little to fill you in or bring you up to speed.  The film begins with Jesus of Nazareth being apprehended by Roman soldiers.  It becomes clear that Jesus is undergoing some personal and spiritual struggle.  In the arrest scene, Jesus' struggle is primarily shown as an internal one, with actor James Caviezel doing a fairly respectable job.  The dialogue for the film is entirely Aramaic and Latin, though, so it's difficult to gauge the performances outside of inflection and body language.  For most of the rest of the film, Jesus' struggle turns from an internal, personal, spiritual struggle, to an external one.  And thus the film becomes a plot-driven spectacle film, rather than a character-driven drama.  Case in point.  Rather than Jesus' internal conflicts and suffering being played out via subtext, we are treated to hours of physical torment and bloody gruesome torture.  Incidently, there are few movies more violent than this one, but they are out there.  The problem with the external portrayal of Jesus' suffering is that without having studied beforehand, a viewer doesn't know WHO Jesus is....Before I'm hunted down for suggesting that audience members might not know who Jesus Christ is, I'm reviewing this movie -- NOT Christianity.  During the course of the film, we're given three or four brief flashbacks into Jesus' adult life, to help explain who this man is and how he wound up in the predicament we find him in at the beginning of the film.The first flashback is a fairly mundane and trite sequence showing Jesus interacting with his mother, Mary.  We get the idea that he's sort of an average guy at this point, nice enough, in that honor thy mother (and father) sort of way.  He is humble and hard working, loving and honest.  Seems like an okay guy.  The two other flashback moments involve a scene at what seems to be ""The Last Supper"" -- a moment that non-Christians or those not up on their bible studies may not recognize.  This scene did very little to develop Jesus as a sympathetic character.  In fact, he says ""I am the way"" and, though these are the words we're familiar with in the King James edition of the bible, without context it seems fairly arrogant.  Again -- this is a critique of the film, not the bible.  With greater context, rather than just a short several minute flashback sequence, one could get the full gestalt of his message, whether a viewer believes he was suggesting the way was literally through him, or that he was an example on how to live one's life.  The most effective flashback (if I remember correctly) was the Sermon on the Mount sequence.  Cleverly, the filmmakers choose the verse about loving thine enemies rather than persecuting them.  This is the only flashback I feel truly worked to paint a picture of Jesus as a peaceful and forgiving man, the type of man that would build a following and change the world.  It is particularly interesting in contrast with the rest of the film, in which Jesus' enemies specifically do NOT forgive, and specifically DO persecute him.  It is a stark reminder that Jesus lived his life in peace, with love in his heart.  He was not vengeful, and ultimately, rather than persecute his enemies, he allowed himself to be killed, for he believed he would be reborn.  This flashback sequence, however, is but a brief few seconds amongst hours of bloody violence.  Finally there is a short sequence in which Jesus intervenes as angry crowd prepares to stone Mary Magdalene to death.  The scene is short, and without much backstory, we only gain the wisdom of ""let he who hath not sinned cast the first stone,"" a powerful statement, indeed.  The depth of Jesus' forgiveness here, though, is not explored.  Why was the crowd preparing to kill this woman, and why did Jesus come to her aid?  Again, bible readers will recognize this scene and its relevance, but the curious non-christian viewer will not understand its signifigance.  The laws of the Old Testament and Jesus' direct challenge to such vengeful ways goes unmentioned.During the rest of the film, Jesus' seems somewhat distracted, his dialogue fairly abstract.  Without knowing the full story of who the man was and what he had accomplished and done, Jesus unfortunately comes across as obstinate and somewhat disengaged.  The film itself does not portray Jesus as a sympathetic character... That is, until...It is difficult to not suffer along with the protagonist as he is beaten within an inch of his mortal life, then forced to carry an enormous wooden cross through the town, up a mountain, and is eventually crucified on the thing.Ultimately, the film's greatest failure is that we only see a man tortured, and see very little of that man's greatness, his accomplishments and wisdom and teachings.  However, the filmaker, Mel Gibson has chosen to focus on the suffering of Jesus, and man does he deliver.  What is odd, is that it is said that the hands that nail Jesus to the cross are in fact Mel Gibson's.  I question why he shot his own hands in this sequence, why he felt the need to write his way into history in that way.The movie looks and sounds fairly good.  Neither the score nor the cinematography are anything to write home about for an epic of this sort, but they are certainly proficient and above average.  The picture does not look as though it were shot by Slawomir Idziak or Janusz Kaminski.  The score is plenty powerful in the theater but will not follow you home.There is much to be said about this film from a sociopolitical standpoint, but this is not where you'll hear that.  Essentially, you already know where you stand in support or against this film for political or religious reasons.  I only hoped to give an objective, filmic critique of the piece, as if viewed from inside a bubble.  Where none of you are."	2.0	From a strictly filmic point of view...	2005-03-10	16	6	10

THis movie will strengthen the faith of any believer and make a non-believer either believe or gain just a bit of faith. This movie has had the biggest impact on me than anything has ever had on me. It takes you through the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. It shows how gruesome his death was as they kicked, punched, whipped, spat on him, and tore his skin from head to toe. It is not meant for someone who might get sick from watchin something so gruesome. When he is nailed ur body jumps whith each hammer of the nail. As if you too can feel his pain.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A25TDEGIPHZTZS	"chris banez lim ""Crutchead"""	"The crucifixion is one of the most highly effective means ever given by God to man in order to execute a criminal. Its method is to suffucate its recepient by nailing the person in a seated possition without any buttocks or back support, while hanging dependently with its nailed hands across, along with the feet nailed together, that the criminal crucified would thus be forced to pull its body upward through its nailed hands, while using the nailed feet to push upward in order for some air to come into it's lungs by lifting its body , so as to loosen the strangulation caused by the rib cage , when a person is set in such a possition . This movie THE PASSION Of The Christ, focused itself on the last days (or rather hours) of Christ in its intentional means to fully visualize the torture and great hardships that Christ went through in order to die for the sins of mankind as a means of retribution to save men's souls -- through loosely unbiblically based dramatization sequences with the help of amazing make up prosthetics and special effects, and with the means to emote a lot in its scenes for that matter - which could've saved itself of some - if they only stick with the facts to be authentic with the details, like if they studied enough and get the idea of how the crucifixion really works, it would've simply saved the producers all of the trouble by trying to be so gory dramatic in the number of sequences for this film. As it is that the main idea of director Mel Gibson and its production is to show the viewers how much Christ have suffered, and gain the viewers's conviction about it. However, the movie have in that aspect have studied the type of lashing methods which are being used in that time that Christ have recieved, peculiarly, even based on the enigmatically fraudulent TURIN SHROUD findings.Supported by the Jesuits, this Mel Gibson film heralds to share the sentiments of the Catholics with regards to Mary. However biblical it is with the emphasis concerning the Jews who have the part of pushing Christ into his death by crucifixion, which caused the protest within the Jewish community for the film as ""anti-semetic"" -- the movie's main purpose is to pull up the sentiments concerning the Saviour's sacrifice for mankind's sins and their retribution.Through flashbacks along with its storylines sequences, the movie is uncanny to the viewer in its presentation - that it is devoid of any detailed explanations for the scenes as if it have totally considered that all who would view the film are already familliar of the story of Jesus Christ. Let alone who would comprehend what are the things that are going on in the motion picture if one is totally unfamilliar to any of the accounts of Christ written in the Bible.However though, the film is a success as far as its tear-jerking factor is concerned as it have been effective in that aspect to the most of its audiences.Furthermore, if in any case an athiest would watch the film should he be convinced or moved about the saviour, when the movie seemed to only have its strongest appeal to those who are already symphathizers of the faith. Anyhow, given that if it is indeed the idea that Christ's mission on earth is to open up an access for the salvation of mankind by dying on the cross and through sufferings-- then God is fond of using irony indeed."	2.0	To Nail or not to nail	2004-04-11	22	5	17
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2BXVL1JW115LS	"ChrisB ""ChrisB"""	Full of blood and gore but lacking any real sense of majesty, glory or spirituality.  Obviously the intention was to show the reality of what Christ endured, giving us a better appreciation of his sacrifice.  For devout Christians, I can understand how they might bring their own sense of faith and &#34;passion&#34; to the intensity of what's being shown.  But as a film, and as a historical account, it expressed a lot of pain and agony but not a great deal of depth.  I don't believe for one second Mel Gibson was inspired by God to make this, and that kind of talk is just crazy fanaticism.  Visually, the movie looked very closed in and confined, when there should've been a feeling of expansiveness.  &#34;Braveheart&#34; was more inspiring and epic than this, which shouldn't be the case.  In fact, I was more moved by Jesus Christ Superstar than &#34;The Passion.&#34;	2.0	The Book Was Better	2013-11-27	3	0	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ICAAD0883C47	Chris B.	I listen to the New Testament on tape in my car every day. I have listened to all four versions of the Gospels and all of The Apostle Paul's letters and teaching several times over. Paul pretty much laid down the entire belief system of Christianity, after Jesus Christ's revealing what He called &#34;The Good News&#34;.This movie, for me, was the most accurate portrayal of both the Authority and suffering of Christ. Nowhere in the New Testament will one find Christ being anything less than absolutely in charge. He knew exactly what was coming at all times, and from the very beginning knew that He would die, and in what manner. Imagine knowing you would die a horrible, excruciating death; for years, maybe decades. He knew all the references about Himself in the Scriptures. What kind of burden would that be on your mind, your emotions, maybe even your body?  And even knowing &#34;The Hour&#34;, as Jesus Christ said.The moment when it all begins, when He begins to suffer and be extremely sorrowful, is where the movie begins: The Garden of Gethsemane. You all have probably heard the accounts of Christ's Passion, so you know where Christ's Passion leads the Savior to.I can't say enough about this movie. It would literally take me hours.This movie changed my life.  It made weep deeply the first and second time I watched it, both for Jesus, and His Mother Mary.  It filled me with tears to see Mary seeing Her Divine Son being obliterated. Any parent can feel that, if you've had children, just on a human level. Not to mentioned that She knew Jesus better than anyone. She was His Mom! She was there at every important event of His Life, not to mention the fact  that She lived with Him everyday. Changed His diapers. Fed Him at Her Breast. Taught Him. Watched Him. Who knows the Nature of God better than Her?  She lived with and watched Him and &#34;Pondered/kept all these things in Her Heart&#34;. She was there when he was Crucified. She was there when He appeared to the Apostles after His Resurrection. She was there when the Holy Spirit descended, as Christ promised. She was there and was instrumental in moving Christ to perform His first miracle at Cana.As to the brutal death and violence, that didn't bother me at all. Anyone think the Romans liked to perform nice tidy torture and deaths? Crucifixion was for insurrectionists! To make an example of them!  Many victims died of the scourging, and never made it to the crucifixion.  I feel like finally someone showed it how it really was, or as best as we can know. Thank God for the Miracle of this movie even being made at all in today's Anti-Christian geopolitical spirit of the air.Much props and gratitude to Mel Gibson. Thank you, Jim, all the cast and crew and producers for the Miracle. It changed my life and brought me eternally closer to Jesus Christ and His Mother Mary.Jesus the Bread of Life John 6:27-29&#34;26Jesus answered them and said, &#34;Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. 27&#34;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.&#34; 28Therefore they said to Him, &#34;What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?&#34;&#8230;29Jesus answered and said to them, &#34;This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.&#34;&#8230;	5.0	Best movie ever made of Jesus Christ's Passion	2014-01-12	2	2	0

Even with all of the controversy, you have stood by your film and I salute your commitment and passion for your work and your faith.This is an amazing movie.  Yes, there are very many appalling scenes of Jesus being beaten and crucified.  This movie made me tear up in many parts, especially when Jesus saw his mother Mary and gained strength, after a brutal lashing, to continue carrying his cross to his eventual death.  This movie really made me realize one thing.  Any time that I feel as though I am sacrificing alot, I will think back on the punishment Jesus recieved for our sins and realize how ridiculous I am.	5.0	Powerful truth	2004-02-28	1	1	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AIZN7WYHINEFT	Christian J. Fobian	"Excellent portrayal of the story Christ. I think that everyone should watch this once, although it is not something I would sit down and watch often. It is very graphic, but the death and torture of Christ was very barbaric. The reason that I gave this movie 4 out of 5 and not 5 stars was the fact that the story focuses a lot of the physical abuse and persecution of Christ, but this was not all that was going on. There was a HUGE spiritual battle that was going on as well. Christ underwent more than just the physical pain of being hung on the cross, but deal with bearing the sins of us all, which was more painful than the physical that was going on. I think that it is important to keep this in mind when watching the film.Overall this film has had much controversy, it seems as if it has ""offended"" some Jews, making them seem cruel. Those who feel offended have taken this out of context. It was the Jews who sacrificed Christ who were brutal. Not all Jews are this way, nor does the film imply that all Jews are this way, thus, do not take offense when watching this film if you are Jewish.-Christian Fobian, Author of Why Christ?"	4.0	Must See at Least Once	2006-11-09	11	7	4

It really made me understand more deeply the great and wonderful love that my Saviour has foreach and everyone of us. Even though the Jews despised Him, Heshowed an awesome amount of compassion and love for them,too.I dislike how so many people say that the Jews are responsiblefor Jesus' death b/c that is totally beside the point! Every single one of us,wheither we're Catholic,Christian,Jew or Paganwe are ALL responsible for the death of Christ.Some people did not cry during the movie,but were deeply moved.Others,were not very moved at all,and still others(like myself:),absolutely cried our eyes out during the whole thing!It really moved me and helped me in my spiritual life as well.I hope that many more people will be touched by this film afterreading my review. Mel did an absolutely superb job as well on the photagraphy,location of the filming and the actual story.I really do not think that anyone else could of done a moreprofessional job. Way to go,Gibson!Jim Caviezel did a great job of acting as Jesus as well.I think of Jesus acting almost the same way as Caviezel potrayed Him in the film.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1EKOYM2H8EYIR	Christine Durrenberger	"It's been 3 days and 23 hours since I saw ""The Passion of the Christ"", and I am still in awe.  Each time I sit down to write something about it, I end up frustrated because I don't have the words in me to express what the film is and what it does.Cinematically it's perfect.  Viscerally, it's brutally. Spiritually, it's divine.  The best way to understand the impact is to look at the crowds waiting to see the movie in contrast to those walking out of the movie.  We went as a church group of 300, cramming in a jovial, talkative lobby of the multiplex.  The previous showing of the movie ended and the crowd having just seen the movie moved passed us silently, tearfully, humbly.  We knew then it's wasn't a popcorn movie.  Two hours later, we were the sobbing, silent bunch filing past the anxious newbies.  I saw their faces and they knew then.  Someone in the line waiting to see it handed me a tissue.  I wanted to say ""you will never be the same"" but I just couldn't.  We just stood in the lobby and hugged and cried.As a Christian, I have no doubt in my mind that Mel Gibson was only the key grip and this movie was written, produced and directed by God.  Watching my friends, my town, and the nation receive this film, I am stirred and inspired.  No preacher in my 38 years of going to church ever gave me what ""The Passion of the Christ"" gave me in 2 hours.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1O834DDK5QNKE	"Christopher Beard ""I...review...huh?"""	"What is there to say about this movie? This is the story that portraying to us that God has opened the door for all to heaven. You can't sugarcoat what happened to Jesus, and you can't dumb it down. Listen up people, watch this movie and remember this as you watch it: This is all for you! No, not for all of mankind, but for you. God's love is so great for us that he would give his son for just one of us. This movie was made with a purpose, and it's purpose was fulfilled. Gibson did a masterful job as well as Caviezel.Listen to me, watch this movie...and if by the end there is not a tear running down your cheek then check your heart. No, don't check your heart, check if you have one. And if your heart doesn't jump and your whole world isn't upside down at the part where Jesus turns to say ""This day you will be with me in paradise"" to the sinner on the cross next to him, check your pulse. I have no idea where people are even coming up with these wild allegations that this movie is not in line with the bible, are you sure you watched the right movie and you aren't reading the book ""Adventures of Huck Finn""? I think that is just crazy because I've been studying the New Testament and I just don't see where it isn't following the Bible.This movie isn't fiction, it is real. THIS HAPPENED OUT OF LOVE FOR YOU! It was all for you. I watch that movie and just rejoice at the thought of someday I will be with that man in heaven. I can't wait until God comes for his loved ones. This movie is life-changing, no, this movie is the story of our lives and the greatest gift that has ever been given. I commend Mel Gibson in his passion on making the movie, the man has some gumption. Watch this movie, if you've seen it, watch it again and check your heart.

Many of the reviews on here and throughout the community say that this film is life changing...is it life changing...not sure I would go that far on this one...yes it is sad the things that they did to our Jesus Christ, and I am very proud of what he did for us and our sins. I love our Christ a lot! AMEN!!The film seemed to jump around a bit...a major plus for this film is the subtitles that ran across the screen were timed very well, and they were easy to read...they did not distract from the film at all.Is this film a bomb???

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A4LLXH0IZ3LMQ	"Christopher Forbes ""weirdears"""	"I find myself approaching the review of this movie with mixed emotions. I know that whatever I say will be a magnet for negative votes. So I may as well just be honest about it. I found the movie by turns beautiful and infuriating. When I think back over it more of the infuriating stuff comes up, and yet I was moved a number of times during the film. sometimes the movie seems to be cheap and exploitive and sometimes it is pierced through with an obvious spiritualityFirst of all....the good things about the film. The visuals are actually quite beautiful, like a Carravaggio come to life. Gibson is obviously highly influenced by Counter-Reformation ideals of art (with both good and bad results I think) but as for visual beauty, you can't do much worse than that for inspiration.I found many of the ""small"" moments to be the most compelling. The healing of Malchus, the High Priest's servant was very moving, perhaps the one moment in the movie where you got an inking of why Jesus' death is supposed to be a greater tragedy than the suffering of countless other Jews in Palestine during that time. The Denial of Peter was also very moving, though this is the one story in Holy Week that is always guaranteed to reduce me to tears. I relate to Peter rather strongly. Some of the other flashbacks are equally powerful, if I think too short. Why we didn't get the entire scene of Jesus stopping the stoning of ""Mary Magdalene"" I'll never really know...it's one of the most beautiful passages in the Gospel of John.Okay...now the problems or questions. First of all, is the blame of Jesus' death placed on the Jews? Yes and no....it is certainly placed on the Jewish authorities. If you are to be at all faithful to the Gospels you can't get around doing this...so in that aspect the movie is as anti-Semitic as I believe the Gospel of Matthew and John are in parts. You can blame the movie, but the blame should go squarely at the source I think. To sweep this part under the rug, you have to cut out part of the Gospel.What concerns me more is the subtle anti-Jewish aspects of the film, Some of the aspects are so subtle that I don't think many people without a lot of background in Biblical history will catch them. For one thing, Gibson does not portray the Last Supper as a Seder. There is some disagreement in the Gospels on this point. Matthew, Mark and Luke place the Last Supper on the first night of Passover, while John places it on the last night before Passover. Gibson takes the last view, as he shows Jesus blessing and distributing pita bread rather than unleavened bread. This is a subtle point, but it reinforces the unconscious idea that Jesus wasn't really Jewish. And it's not the only example of this in the movie, just the most obvious.The worst scene to me is one that doesn't get much comment. Judas, in torment over his betrayal of Jesus is teased by a bunch of little children, looking like little Yeshiva boys in short pants and yarmulkes. (I'm not even sure that yarmulkes date back that far, but I need to research this. I do know that kids wouldn't have worn short pants!) The yeshiva boys then turn into demons. This ""attack of the killer yeshiva boys"" is perhaps one of the most evil things in the movie, being purely out of Mel's fantasy mind and having no bearing in scripture at all.Then there is the issue of the filmmaking itself. By focusing so exclusively on the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, Gibson leaves very little room for character development. If you come to this movie as a committed Christian, you probably will be moved, since you know the character of Jesus already. But for those without much familiarity with the story, the characters are hopelessly two-dimensional. We know that Peter, Mary, Mary Magdalene and others are moved and distraught over Jesus' execution, but we don't really know why from a motivational standpoint. Taking the last twelve hours of Jesus' life without at least a little insight into who Jesus was, robs the movie of context and robs the death of Jesus of it's context.Also, the focus of this movie is so unrelentingly on the death of Jesus as to be a theological distortion. Jesus' death is one of the central mysteries of the Christian faith, but only one of them, and perhaps not the most central. The Resurrection is what puts it all in perspective, and that's given very short shrift in this movie. This plus the extreme realism of the movie, actually defeats a Traditionalist viewpoint that Jesus was both Human and Divine.So, in conclusion, for me the movie was worth seeing. Even with all the caveats I mentioned, I did get something from the movie. It was akin to the kind of Ignatian meditation that I usually do on Good Friday. I think that if someone goes into the movie with a religious bent, you will come out with something. But if you aren't religious, this movie isn't going to convert you. You'll probably just feel lost and repelled.One final thought: the most disturbing thing about this movie to me didn't happen during the movie but happened at the end as the lights were coming up. Behind me an African-American man said to his date: ""Now I hate the Jews even more than I did before. They deserved what they got in the Holocaust."" A chill went up and down my spine at that. to hear something like that come out of someone's mouth out loud scared me down to my bones.  While this may not be Mr. Gibson's fault, the movie is fanning the flames and he's done precious little to douse them!"	3.0	By Turns Beautiful and Frustrating	2004-03-16	42	23	19
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	The Passion of The Christ, dealing with the last days of Jesus's life, is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus, laughing at his pain, mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent, but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable, and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it.	2.0	If a two hour Jesus lynching is what you want, here you have it.	2006-01-25	30	8	22

It is the only film I know of made in the last 50 years or so that is acted according the the &#34;old school&#34; style of acting, I did not think it was possible to find people who can act, and feel their part.  The film has that rare ability to make the audience &#34;there&#34; to draw you out of yourself and make you feel you are a part of each scene.  Not to be missed. Yes it's violent, but the redemption of mankind was not to be had without suffering and violence, the death of the Lord was violent.

Given that the earliest gospel was set down some forty years after the given date for Jesus' execution, and that the only other ""reputable"" reference is ascribed to Flavius Josephus (himself something of a fabulist [as well as a Jew swayed to things Roman -- unlike Saul/Paul -- to whom we may owe all that is currently recognizable as Jesus]), who can be sure.  But Mel Gibson is sure -- as sure in his Catholic beliefs, as his father is sure that there was no Holocaust (a fascinating juxta- (junta?) position, this: papa damns the Jews as liars, son creates an equivalent holocaust movie for Christians starring a Jew).  And the movie?  Well, cinematically, it is dazzling -- sepia to blood-red tones, sure-handed editing, appropriate Latin and Aramaic dialogue (with subtitles), horrific (as well as reputedly accurate) special effects, meticulous sets and costumes, a wrenching soundtrack, performances that rival (and sometimes surpass) anything on the silent screen (where dialogue was unnecessary given the emotive skills of the actors), and a direction (by Gibson) that is unrelenting in its graphic presentation of Christianity's first (and greatest) martyr.  But, throughout, I was driven to ask myself, what faith, what God, would compel a man to suffer what the Jesus (Jim Caveziel) in this film suffered?  And, what God, faith, disciple or follower, would so demand, expect or allow these agonies to be endured by one who ostensibly taught and lived love, tolerance and forgiveness?  Buddhism says, simply, that life is hard but suffering is optional; it is our choice whether we live gladly or painfully (Hamlet's ""there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so""); we need not seek out suffering to prove ourselves or to make ourselves more worthy (""better"").  I thus found myself watching and wishing Jesus would let everyone -- himself included -- off the hook; that he would show compassion for himself -- as well as for those who loved him -- and were looking on -- by not getting painfully to his feet for a more brutal beating, by not staying silent when before Pilate, etc.  Which then is the real and last temptation (with apologies to Kazantzakis) -- giving oneself over to a great matyrdom (and its accompanying saint-like gratification) or allowing it to be visited -- horribly -- on a loved one; imagine the anguish of Jesus' disciples, and that of both Marys, who chose to stand by while their master, brother, son, god, was beaten, tortured and then hung from a tree?  Romans, in an occupied country, were horrifically pragmatic -- crucifixions were cheap, they were public, they were often and they were bloody -- as any good deterrent against insurrection should be (proponents of capital punishment -- and I am not one of them -- arguing it as a deterrent should reconsider public executions).  And they were unforgettable -- remember the crucified along the Appian Way after the rebellion of Spartacus?  Gibson spares us nothing. It is as if he is testing our faith by asking us to endure -- visually -- all that he believes his Jesus endured.  And, like those who slow down on a public highway to get a better look at a traffic accident, we don't turn away.  ""What's next?"" we ask inside ourselves.  ""What new horror will be be visited on this poor man?""  And, those with faith, both in the story and in the man, might be asking as well ""do I deserve God's grace if the cost is such extreme suffering visited on one man?""The Passion is a very ably done film; but is close to unendurable; its excesses (and they are exactly that, however skillfully brought off) are inexcusable; I was left feeling as if I'd endured ringside seats at the first snuff film starring God.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3CM1CDUSWYDIO	Christopher Schmitz	"Up to this point, I considered 1993's ""Schindler's List"" the ultimate in cinematic emotional drain.  But ""The Passion of the Christ"" stirs even more emotions, the most salient of which are anger, shock, and melancholy.  By tapping into the primary art medium of our time, the darkest slice of Christ's biography, his torture and execution at the hands of Jewish clergy and Roman authority, has once again asserted itself as the most influential story ever told.Opening in a Gethsemane bathed in blue light, director Mel Gibson quickly introduces one of his innovations, an androgynous and Druidic Satan figure who will flit through the rest of the narrative, appearing even on the via dolorosa carrying some sort of mutant child.Overall, however, the film is faithful, perhaps even excessively faithful, to the canonical gospel accounts of Christ's last hours.  It strives for realism enough to allow its characters to speak Latin and Aramaic, revealing Jesus' name as ""Yehosua,"" but it presents the miraculous as well:  Christ restoring a man's sliced ear or the temple cracking in half as the moment of Christ's death.  Most significantly, it presents the resurrection of Christ in a brief and artful scene in which he disappears from his tunic, which fluffs and falls, reconstituting himself as unblemished except for the holes of his stigmata.But Jesus is hardly unblemished through most of the film.  Unless you've moved into the rathole vacated by Saddam Hussein, you're aware that this 2004 film offers the most graphic presentation of Jesus' suffering in any Christ film yet.  His torturers are far more sadistic than in ""King of Kings"" or ""Jesus of Nazareth.""  The scene of Christ's scourging has quickly become a conversation piece as the movie rules the box office.  Most of the Romans who administer the scourging are vicious thugs who seem to relish the destruction of a body.  Choosing a whip whose hooks tear flesh from bone, they render Jesus a bloody pulp from head to toe, exposing spongy subdermal layers and even a few ribs.  By the time the actual crucifixion occurs, we see an elbow bone poking through skin as well.  The first nail is driven in with a geyser of blood.This is not, however, gratuitous violence.  The suffering here is the point.  It is a statement and a sacrifice in the mind of the one suffering and his two billion believers.  Actually, Mel Gibson pulls his punches in a few places, since crucifixion involved asphyxiation and baking in the sun, neither of which isdepicted in ""The Passion.""The acting and direction are solid, even excellent in ""The Passion the Christ,"" but the real star here is an ace cinematographer.  Certain visuals are seared on your brain after seeing ""The Passion.""  These include the unctuous eyebrow-less devil with his mutant baby, the scenes of the two Marys taking linen and mopping what looks like gallons of Jesus' blood from around the scourging post, and the scene which finally brought tears:  As she watches her son fall with his cross, Mary remembers him falling as a little boy.  Maternal concern written all over her face, she runs to pick him up.  But 30 years later as she approaches her son, she is unable to aid him, only watch the gruesome spectacle.  His hair stringy, his face covered in blood and sweat, he assures her:  ""See!  I make everything new!""Was anyone ever so misunderstood as Christ?  So many in the film from Pilate to Caiaphas just don't comprehend that Christ doesn't seek power in the material world but would rather direct our eyes to a simmering mirage on a distant dune, the lifeforce around and within us, the everlasting spirit that will survive our bodies whose oxygen addiction will prove fatal in 80 years.  Mutiple and brief flashbacks to the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper feature a robust charismatic Jesus, but perhaps these are too brief and too few as some have complained.  They might have been increased and lengthened to create a more effective counterpoint to the story's endless gore.Still, even this complaint may arise from discomfort with massive human suffering.  Doesn't a person with advanced HIV symptoms suffer like this?  How about a person standing near a Palestinian suicide bomber or withering in a Serbian death camp?  This kind of agony and destruction is still all around us, so Jesus' ability to find meaning in it will not lose its power to amaze or its staggering value anytime real soon."	5.0	Its Attributes Overcome Its Flaws	2004-03-04	5	3	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2WNGZZVOFR40Y	"""chyno37"""	"So many people and critics have slashed this film calling it the most violent movie they have ever seen and that the point gets lost in all the ""pornographic"" depictions of torture Christ endures.  People have also been criticizing the film for not focusing more on the message Jesus preached rather than his crucifixion, well those people need to get a clue rather than a half-cocked opinion, Christians and Catholics included.  The title 'The PASSION', in its original meaning, refers specifically to the SUFFERING that Christ endured from his arrest to his death, not the three years he spent in ministry from age 30-33.  The message in this film is explicitly about the violence, hence the title, to show the true agony that one man went through to save those who couldn't save themselves.  And for those who say that the film is anti-semitic, that Jews KILLED Jesus, try reading the Bible.  It specifically says that Christ 'gave up his spirit', he wasn't killed or tortured to death (which would have been at the hands of the Romans anyway since the Jewish sanhedrin was incapable of condemning anyone to death), he willingly gave himself up and he knew from the beginning that he would have to go through such pain in order to create the new covenant between God and man.  If you had to take the sin of the world upon yourself while being nailed to a cross would you really want to live evena  minute longer?One more note...to the reviewer who said that Gibson cast an effeminate man to play Satan, the actor was actually a woman, with a man's voice dubbed over.  He wanted to present the Devil as odd, yet enticing, almost beautiful in a strange way. And for those who didn't get the part with the hairy baby in Satan's arms, it was a DEMON, even my friends didn't get that.  How you could miss that is beyond me, it sure wasn't mini-me.  See this film for yourself and not because of the critiques of others, it's one you have to judge for yourself.  For me I was deeply moved, do I fault those who weren't?

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A25L5XR8GVS7PJ	C. J. Booth	The reviewer who touts himself as an intellectual (who lacks basic typing skills), made a few large assumptions.  You speak freely of truth and reality, yet you dismiss religion wholeheartedly.  The problem with this is that without religion or philosophy of any kind, truth and reality have no definition.  By this I mean that religion and philosophy define truth for us in terms that aren't redundant.  If you define truth or reality as the things that happen to us every day, then you are simply saying that truth and reality are only those things of which we are aware.  That is a very limited view of reality.  However, if you broaden your view of truth and reality to include those things outside or our awareness, then you shoot your evidential argument full of holes.This movie shows a part of the truth of the life, death, and ressurection of Jesus Christ.  The whole truth is that his death on that Cross was meant to atone for the sins of everyone.  However, the reality is that only those who believe in Him will receive that atonement and a personal relationship with the God that created reality and truth.Here is your challenge.  I challenge you to read Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis, and Jesus Among Other Gods by Ravi Zecharias.

I was stunned by the display of human cruelty and it was extremely difficult to sit through certain parts for director Mel Gibson (who did a fabulous job) refused to hold back and sugarcoat the truth. However, beyond all the blood and violence lay the heart of the story which was Jesus of Nazareth (played by James Caviezel) not giving in to fear and remaining strong for his many disciples and for the Lord, His heavenly father. He couldn't even bring himself to hate the ones punishing him for his teachings were to love not only those who love you back but everyone - even your enemy - for hate only begets to more hate. I was moved to tears at the excruciating torture He suffered as He died on the cross just so us imperfect mortals could be forgiven for the sins we commit so if you haven't seen this yet than I implore that you do.

When I entered the cinema, on a Saturday night, it was packed with people waiting with a bucket of popcorn on their lap.They stop eating when the flogging started. The scene is far too long and self indulgent. Cardinal Lustiger,(archibishop of Paris) said ""This film is no less than sheer gore to attract spectators and it reflects the attitude of our society""! I agree a little.Some remarks- The symbols were not as silly as in the Last Temptation. It is difficult to say if Satan is a man or a woman, he is attractive and an androgyne. It is a very good idea, (Gibson remembered that angels are sexless and yet the actor is an actress)- Judas is a likeable poor sod. He was well acted, showing a man who realises, in a confused way, that he is led by his destiny. The horrid kids who are after him, pushing him to suicide are the reproduction of the Greek legend where Orestes is hunted by flies representing remorses. The ugly kids are the remorses and I hope Judas is in Heaven if it exists.- If the film is anti Jewish it is only for those who are already anti Jewish. I only felt angry towards a God allowing such sufferings. The Romans definitely come out far worse. How can a such refined civilization behave like that?? (They also transformed Christians into pet food for the lions and crucified all Spartacus's rebelled slaves)-  The mob has not changed. One day you are a hero, the next they want to tear you apart.- The scenes with Mary Magdelene and the Resurection were too brief.

The Passion really gave me the sense of Christianity as the worship of the killing of god and the worship of the ascendancy of man. With the gross amount of genocide, pain, and suffering that Christianity has been responsible for, as well as the respressive contributions it has given Western Society (not to mention the fear driven obliteration of indigenous societies), I really believed that it has served the purpose it was instiutionalized to serve.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A20X4KFGXHFNX	Clifford Dawson	"I came at this film from a non-Christian perspective in that I think the events portrayed either never happened or were so distorted by those who wrote the Gospels that they beared no resemblance to history.  That meant I couldn't respond to the guilt trip Mel Gibson meant to put on everyone about how Jesus  suffered for everyone's sins, so I looked at it as just a movie. A very boring movie.First the good parts. I thought using the ancient languages worked very well as did the look of the film, which featured some good filter effects (the garden scenes) and a drab color palette that evoked the past more than a bright one would have. I also liked Maia Morgenstern's performance as Mary. She did an excellent job of portraying her mixed feelings of pride and pain. The sets of the city were good and there were some great landscape shots, especially from the mountains. I also thought the DTS soundtrack was very good.Those weren't enough to make this a good movie for me though. The beatings grew boring very quickly, which made the final half of the film very tedious for me. Mel Gibson mostly worked in caricatures, portraying the Roman soldiers as mindless brutes, the apostles as dim-witted cowards and the Jews as a rabid mob. James Caviezel did a good enough job playing an impossible role, but I didn't find someone covered in blood or woodenly quoting biblical passages particularly interesting. The scenes with the Satan character didn't work for me at all.There was also the problem that, if you weren't a Christian or familiar with the Christian mythology, this movie would have made no sense at all. I guess to Gibson this wasn't a problem, since he was making this film for a specific audience. That audience made him a lot of money, so I suppose the choices he took worked for his pocketbook. That does not make this a great movie though. (As far as the anti-Semitic question, I agree that this film qualified. The Jews suffered for centuries because of the ""Christ Killer"" label, and this movie echoed that belief. The Romans may have did the killing, but the Jews started the ball rolling, a fact Gibson hammered home repeatedly.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A11NMQB8JSMSP6	"Clint Simmons ""MysticVenom"""	"First off, yes I am a Christian.  I really found this whole movie to be a complete waste of my time.  It really demands a complete suspension of belief to think this movie is anything resembling historically accurate.  First off, no human body would live through the flogging they gave Jesus in this movie.  So you say ""but he's Jesus"", and I counter with: ""He's human"".  Hence, no human could've lived through that, let alone walk afterwards or carry a cross.Next up, the Romans (specifically Pilate) would have had no compassion.  C'mon people, these were the same guys that brought us the Colliseum and opened it with 180 days of gladiator battles.  Yes, I believe entirely that Pilate forced the temple Jews specifically call out Christ to be crucified, but not in a sympathetic to Jesus standpoint.  It would have been more aligned with making them the perpetrators of the incident (remember, Pilate didn't want the Romans getting mixed up in any of the temple's affairs), so this is more of a sadistic CYA move on his part.Lastly, what's with the geyser of blood and water pooring from the spear wound?  The bible says that blood and water were spilled, not a fountain of it - the amount shown coming out of him would've desecated a human.Oh yes - that whole table/chairs incident?  What/Why?  A complete distraction.  Yes, he was a carpenter but why add that he's *inventing* the modern table/chair setup?  Complete lack of accuracy and a distraction.Well, I've said my piece.  This is a complete waste of time.  If you enjoy the whole blood/gore thing you are better off with something like Resident Evil or any number of slasher movies.  If you are seeking spiritual guidance I'd suggest The Gospel According to St Matthew or King of Kings or The Greatest Story Ever Told.  All of those are better.  Yes, Christ suffered greatly and that was his gift of divine salvation for the rest of us, but you would never understand that from this movie.

After all, when was the last time that a religious movie came out with such impact? Probably never. I'd like to clarify that Gibson's intention was NOT to try to convert people, he just wanted to portray his vision of the last hours of our Lord. This movie is great, but it's not for children or people that are weak of heart. The images are too strong. Christian or not, this movie would make any one cry... nobody is heartless.

Either it's a Christian propaganda film making the Jews look bad or a wonderful portrayal of the last few hours of Jesus. I heard it was brutal and sadomasochistic and also an accurate description of how the Romans would torture and kill criminals. Regardless of how you may feel going into this film, you can not deny the excellent cinematography, amazing sets and realism this movie portrays. You would have to convince yourself to come out of this movie feeling hatred for the Jews. Nothing shown in the movie made me feel any animosity to anyone including the Jews. The movie pulls you in right away and you actually feel you are their watching Jesus being crucified and I have to admit I did shed a few tears. I could not help it, the movie is that convincing. All this media hype about being overly violent and containing hate towards anyone is flat out ridiculous, and since when does anyone in Hollywood show concern over a violent film especially when they glorify violence, calling it artistic freedom. HYPOCRITES....very pathetic and sad.

Others: too violent. Others: too focused on one aspect. My teacher's sister saw the film and said that while it was good, there was way more to his life than just this. I'm writing this review as a spiritual person. I'm not Catholic, Buddhist, Muslim or Atheist. Or should I say I'm not solely one or the other. My spirituality is diverse with many branches. And people, it's okay to be catholic hater of this film or an atheist lover of it, but people seem to think you either are catholic and hate it or anything else and love. As for the anti-semitics? Please.The film chronicles the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life according to Mel Gibson so this film isn't a pseudo documentary where every event actually transpired(even if people doubt he actually existed). Anyway, the film starts with Christ being betrayed by Judas in the Garden of Gethsemane. Judas takes off and Christ is captured and others want him desperately to be punished. He's taken to Pontius Pilate, but he won't sentence him, King Herod won't either. But instead of risking a rebellion if Christ is freed, he orders his death by crucifixtion.While beautifully shot and some great performances even if you can't understand a word of Aramic or Hebrew, there is some problems. One: there's cases of extremes. The priests who want Christ are SO determined to get him sentenced. The Roman guards come off as extremely sadistic and almost seem to take pleasure with scourging Christ with poles and a vicious-looking cat o'nine tails(it looks like a claw). As for the violence, it is disturbing to a fault. There's a part where one of the claws is caught in Christ's side and is yanked, thereby pulling off some of his flesh. I don't know about you but does that seem necessary after such a brutal torture already? Or how about the 6, count em 6 times Christ falls when carrying his cross to the hilltop? Although one shot is can certainly be disheartening when Christ, nailed to the cross, has to be turned over but from the look of it, would hit the ground face first with the heavy cross crushing him although he's stopped. Quite an unnerving scene.  The Resurrection scene should definately have been longer also.The movie does have its strong points though. For one, the score done by John Debney is one to listen to as it's epic and moving. The cinematography by Caleb Daschanel is very well done, the performances, especially by Jim Caviezel(Christ) and Maia Morgenstern(Mary) are quite impressive too. Another, it's a very thought provoking film and stirred up a lot of debate. Don't listen to those ultra right-wing people who say this is a anti-semitic film. Watch and judge for yourself.	4.0	Cinematic. Powerful. Flawed.	2004-09-14	7	5	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL	C McGhee	This is a film about subjects most people would rather avoid.Death & religion don't lend themselves to rational discussion. Mel Gibson haterswill see this as proof of his insanity & intolerance. Christians will see too much violence to be on a big screen. Humanists will see the shining truth that Christians are gullible fools willingly self deceived, but what about the movie making?The events that are being depicted here are detailed fairly well in the bible. Does the movie stay close to it's literary source as far as events & beatings & death? I say yes it does.Someone somewhere should get credit for putting that on the screen. Your sense of appropriate levels of violence really took a beating in this story as it's told in the Bible. Go complain there. The movie is a good pictorial representation of the subject matter it claims to cover which is, the suffering & death of a man known as Jesus Christ as revealed in a book about his life.You can claim that Jesus never existed. You can claim that these events never happened. You can claim all kinds of personal preferences but you can't claim that this is a bad movie because it didn't stay close to its literary source. You can't claim that it deliberately embellished that story. Mel Gibson certainly didn't create the story & since it wasn't intended to meet any other muster than its relationship to it's source I feel it must be highly rated as a movie & movie making.Are you offended by the show for some reason? The show doesn't care. It wasn't made to not offend. To belittle what was done on screen here is to belittle every movie that ever stayed close to its literary source. I understand that people will have deep feelings because of their personal beliefs but it's really sad to see a movie bring out the sentiments of 'all opposition is based in stupidity or illogical beliefs' & no discussion of the movie or it's crafting.The violence is deep, gritty & horrifying but the subject requires it from the source. This is 5 star cinema & it's not for everyone. Especially not young unformed personalities.You know, you can discuss death, even murder, with a little child but it has to be within his speech & comprehension level. You can show him pictures of death & murder that far exceed their speech & comprehension levels & these images most assuredly exceed what children can comprehend.I'd just like to see more individual evaluations. One's not based on the doctrines of a group, be it religious groups or any others.	5.0	1 more voice	2004-08-01	17	9	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1VWKFNLZAAOQM	"C. Mills ""cam3150"""	"There really are no words to accurately describe the impact this movie has had on me.  I saw it initially 1 year ago when it was released in theaters and have seen it 3 time since.  I have thought about it every day since, in some way or another.  I am a born again Christian and attend an amazing church on a weekly basis so I am not new to this story and am familiar with most of the details that surround Christ's crucifixion.What this movie did was put a visual with something that I have heard about since I was a child.  Christians have glamorized the cross to an extent.  We wear it around our neck, we sing songs about it, we hear sermons about it on Easter Sunday.  But, before this movie, did we really have any idea at all as to the pure torment that Jesus went through for us?  I know that I didn't.  All I knew was what the Bible said and what my pastor preached about it.  I knew that Jesus died, I knew that is was bloody, I knew that His blood covered my sins.  For some reason, these few bits of knowledge were enough.  They should not have been.I will acknowledge that 'The Passion' is more geared towards Christians who are already familiar with the story of Jesus.  However, Mel did himself say that he left out 'backstory' on purpose.  He said that he wanted people to become curious and to go and read the Bible for themselves.  Also, as Mel and Jim Caviezel have said so many times, this movie was a soul focus on the last 12 hours of Jesus' life.  That was Mel's vision, his heart.  ""Passion"" is the word for suffering in Greek so the title of the movie is really ""The Suffereing of the Christ"".  Mel wanted those final, world-changing hours to be put to film in a way that no one has ever dared before.  He accomplished this in spades.I will never think of Jesus without picturing this movie.  Jim Caviezel's job in this movie is astounding.  He literally became Jesus.  He said that, all along, his prayer was that people would not see him, but would only see Jesus.  His prayers were answerd becase that happens in a way that I cannot explain.  I forgot I was watching a movie, I forgot I was reading subtitles.  It was as if, for 2 hours, I was transported back to that time and was literally a fly on the wall, watching all of this take place first hand.  This movie is the Bible come to life.  It give a visual to things that, until now, we have only been able to read about.Yes, the movie is bloody and gruesome.  But, Jesus died for the sins of the world. He had to endure enough torture to encompass every sin that every man from then on would commit.  How is that supposed to look?  Mel stopped short of going 'all the way' with the violence in this move.  I have no doubt that this movie looks like a picnic compared to what Jesus actually went through.  The Bible says that, when the scourging was finished, Jesus did not even resemble a human being anymore.  The violence is there for a reason and it accomplishes what it is supposed to. People who have a problem with it have a problem with their owns sin because that is what it represents.  As Mel said, we all nailed Jesus to the cross.  It wasn't Jews or Gentiles.  It was all of humanity.  That is why, the hand that you see actually nailing Jesus' hand to the cross is Mel's own hand.Trying to orgainze my thoughts regarding this movie is a difficult task, even after the year that has passed since I saw it the first time.  It was so much more than a movie to me.  Without Jesus' death on the cross, I as a Christian have nothing.  His death is the basis for my whole life.  To see it portrayed in such an amazingly beautiful way is more meaningful than anything else I have ever experienced."	5.0	There are no words...	2005-02-28	4	3	1

This film has been wrongly categorized and is really nothing but a HORROR / SLASHER FILM, incorporating elements of the supernatural, but mostly just long lasting sadistic torture....all somehow presumably presented for our entertainment.  OH, and it's in LATIN. Yeah. Fun. If you love watching someone being tortured to death over a two hour period, then this film is for you.This film has nothing entertaining in it (I don't find torture entertaining) and provides nothing that makes us feel good or is uplifting or is of any benefit, except for maybe the some very few interesting costumes and some good visual effects, editing and camera work. This film does not teach any moral lesson or show any examples of doing good for others or how to better one's life or the lives of others. There are no spiritual lessons or examples or guides to spirituality.  There is nothing that inspires any human to be a better human being.Mel gibson's use of eccentric and malformed persons laughing and heckling during one early scene somehow used to convey evil by their malformed appearance is particularly offensive to me as persons who in real life are malformed or suffer other natural disabilities are not intrinsically evil and such malformations are not caused out of some evil act.  I expect the musical score was inspired, or more accurately copied, from Martin Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ.  There is nothing creative here.Mel Gibson seems to be a deeply troubled person with a particular penchant for rewriting history and attacking people, beliefs and ways of life that he finds weird or different or that he simply does not relate to.  I wish he would have just continued acting and have kept his mouth shut; he would have been much easier to like.I find this film's level of outrage just below that of Pier Paolo Passolini's Salo; I own a copy of that film for some very specific reasons, mostly out of my high regard for free speech, rarely watch it due to its potency and perversity, and would never consider owning a copy of this pathetic piece of crap as it seems to have no redeeming value.I imagine Alex, the lead character in A Clockwork Orange, would likely find this entertaining.....Alex in his natural, pre-corrected state.SICK SICK SICK ....and just a HORROR FILM.	1.0	A HORROR FILM....and the product of a truly SICK mind.	2010-09-21	29	6	23
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A84OF8PC3D3AF	Connie Wong	Yesterday I saw the movie Passion of the Christ. I couldn't agree more with the editor's review. I thought the music score and acting were wonderful.  It concerned Christ's last twelve hours on earth, his crucifixion. It was very, very sad as you might imagine. I felt it was very well done, especially the actors who play Jesus and Mary, but they really dwell upon the punishment, the lashings of Christ, and it was very difficult to watch. The movie was all in Latin and Aramaic with English subtitles, which was wonderful for my deaf friend who accompanied me.Jesus had flash backs which were wonderful...but all too short. For anyone who knows the story of what happened, the movie will make perfect sense...but for anyone who has not read the bible and wants to understand what happened, it will be found very lacking, I feel. I think Mel Gibson is assuming that most who see the movie will know the story of Jesus. I have a video at home that is much better at helping those not familiar with the life of Christ, understand his life. It doesn't dwell on his crucifixion, rather on his deeds and teachings while he was here.In Mel's movie, the flash backs are a joyous relief from the cruelty inflicted upon Jesus throughout the movie. It does shine a dim light on the Jewish priests that condemed him to be crucified, and I can understand why there is controversy from the Jewish community. It was difficult for me to believe that all the soldiers who whipped Jesus could take such pleasure out of inflicting that kind of pain on anyone...hated or not. I had to remember it is, after all, a movie. Take a box of kleenex along......Because of the terrible gore, no child under the age of 12 should see this movie. I would encourage every adult to watch it and make up their own minds.	4.0	In My Opinion	2004-03-05	28	18	10
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ECR5R2LV0F0V	Conny Svensson	"Just for the sake of being clear: I am Christian liberal, I don't believe in miracles including virgin birth or the resurrection and I disbelief the gospels as a historical account.Watching the film awoke many feelings in me. I only saw the film in the DVD and not the bonus partsJesus is portrayed as a reflection of Mel Gibson in his Lethal weapon-films. If you remember, he breaks his own arm to get loose and it seems that Jesus goes thru the same phase as Mel when getting whipped or crucified. The milieu of Jerusalem is dark and devilish in the film. Some flashbacks makes Jesus remember his childhood and his period of preaching, but that is all.Mel has created a fascinating symbolism in the film, like how Judas hangs himself with a rope, coming from a dead corpse of a donkey ... or when Satan - as a androgyn scray being - tempts Jesus to give up sending him a snake - Jesus crushes the snake's head alluding to the so-called prophecy of Genesis.It has - I have to admit - some warmth in all the blood and the anti-semitism, in all the violence, its warmth comes from the ""nice"" people around Jesus: the two Maries, Peter, John, Nicodemus and it has that special Catholic mysticism, alluding to stigmata, crucifix and visions.It is Mel's Jesus who appears in the film, a Jesus who is hated by Jews and punished by them and excusing the very horrible Pilate - which by the gospels is portrayed so innocently. But this should be accepted in the frame of faith-promoting films, `cause I hardly believe that Mel would have given Buddha or Muhammad the picture that he gave Jesus.What is sad is also the fact that Mel thinks that it was Jesus' pain that delivered humanity from their sins, in my church, the Swedish Lutheran church, the fact that Jesus died and arose together accomplish a miracle, it is not the fact that he was tortured or that he voluntarily asked getting whipped till the flesh dropped down.In Sweden the film received a cold welcoming and I believe that I am talking for many Swedes who have cultivated a strong independent picture of religion and its effects. Many saw the film as nothing more than a Hollywood version of Jesus the Rambo. What was welcomed was the fact that the film was in Aramaic and not Shakespearan English.Whatever the language spoken: it is Mel who is speaking or his falang of ultra-conservative Catholics.  How wonderful it would be that Christians who hired cinemas in order to show the film could have put their money for people who needed it and not to brainwash others with cheap tomato ketchup dripping from a mutilated man's body. There are countries - as US, Saudi, Tchad -who still condemn people to death and torture them.I can picture the film as a wakening about the horrible death penalty - but as everything it is easy to judge things passed than things occurring right in front us.1 star, cause the film could never ever capture the message of Jesus' 30 or so long life, his wish about the best for his people, for his followers and do remember, his anguish of being put to death.

But that was really no big deal. Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ is a phenomenon of a movie. And it is portrayed accurately according to the Gospel of John.Gibson made a few concessions to Jewish protests and the movie came off without nobody turning to anti semiticism. Do some of you know that a Swedish Neo-Nazi saw the film and was converted to Christianity and renounced his racism and hatred for Jews?This is true!I too believe most people are very overreacting to Mel Gibson's Malibu Meltdown. So many of the Jewish community had it in for him and they seen this as an opportunity to finally get at him.

People today are very visual, so I thank Gibson for giving us a more realistic version. I look forward to more films with this vision of detail and accuracy.And for those people who think it was a bad movie because you didn't get more of what Jesus was all about or His teachings, you really missed the point of the movie. It's about Jesus' LAST 12 HOURS of life on earth. During that time, He really wasn't preaching to the general public. He did that before those last hours. Gibson is a Catholic. He knows the teachings of Jesus. I am a Catholic and grew up being taught those teachings as well. I have an understanding of Jesus and His teachings.

A figure of peace and justice, betrayed by someone close to him and taken by the forces of evil. A man struck down, only to rise again and carry out his mission to bring balance to the world.This is the story of Darth Vader.Amazingly, it also describes the story of ""the Passion of the Christ,"" a film by Mel Gibson. You might think Gibson should stick to making movies about burned-out, widower cops (with or without post-apocalyptic wasteland settings), but brother, you'd be wrong. He proved with ""Braveheart"" that he's adept at directing movies about rebellious, inspirational martyrs...and this time he graciously decided to let somebody ELSE play the starring role!Now, when this flick came out a couple of years ago, it was surrounded by controversy -- and not just because the title contains the word ""the"" more times than any movie except ""the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King."" For one thing, a lot of people thought the movie was anti-Semitic, because a lot of the bad guys were Jewish. Of course, a couple of the GOOD guys were Jewish, too -- not to mention the fact that many of the bad guys were Romans, not Jews. In truth, the movie is more anti-moron than anything. Just look at the portrayal of the d-bags who cackle and hoot while whipping Jesus with that freaky, scaled cat o' nine-tails; they were practically wearing dunce-caps.People also criticized the graphic violence in the movie. Frankly, I found the gore to be somewhat tamer than I was expecting, but I've sat through Troma flicks without blinking an eye. The scourging and crucifixion of Jesus is pretty brutal, but it's counter-balanced by Jim ""Angel Eyes"" Caviezel's excellent moaning. That makes you feel pretty bad for Jesus. Apparently, a bunch of people cried in the theater at these scenes, but I haven't shed tears at a movie since I saw the last five minutes of ""Jason X."" I will admit: I did find myself exclaiming ""Jesus!"" at a couple of points, which is actually pretty appropriate.While all this scourging is going on, a sinister figure constantly lurks in the background. He looks sort of like the dude in ""Powder,"" and in one scene even carries around a little ""Mini-Me"" who snarls at the camera. The film never makes it perfectly clear that this is supposed to be Satan, but the guy's lack of eyebrows makes you pretty sure that it's SOME inhuman force of evil (other than Whoopi Goldberg).Now, forgive me if I spoil the end of the movie, but Jesus is resurrected, and the final shot is him triumphantly standing up to leave his tomb and go kick some serious @ss. Jesus even has holes in his hands from the crucifix, which will cut down wind-resistance when he pimp-slaps evil. It's pretty cool -- I'm hoping Gibson decides to make a sequel, like ""The Passion 2: Operation Stranglehold"" or something.In truth, the most impressive thing about ""the Passion of the Christ"" was the marketing. Seriously, only Jesus himself has had a better Public Relations campaign. I mean, it's an okay flick, but they really made it seem like The Most Important Film of All Time.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3VDGERHHLOQVQ	Crabby Apple Mick Lee	"There are two different approaches within Christianity when it comes to Jesus of Nazareth.  The first focuses on the teachings of Jesus-especially the ""love your neighbor"" part.  The approach believes very much that Jesus came here and he had something to say.  The approach has had a long and honorable history within the Church.  Past a certain point it begins to break apart as far as exactly what it was Jesus had to say; but it is generally agreed that the message was of divine origin and reflected something about the mind of God.  In this regard, The Passion Of The Christ comes up short in that it is devoid of clear spiritual teachings.  Even the flashback to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount seems more than just a little subtle.  Instead we have a gut wrenching account of Jesus' sufferings on the way to the cross that is frankly more than many can endure.  Indeed, many members of the ""Jesus-Giver of Spiritual Wisdom"" school have a difficult time giving the crucifixion a meaningful place within the Gospel.  In some ways, by this viewpoint, the whole ""suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried"" part of the Apostles Creed seems more a distraction from the message of Jesus than an illustration of some moral message.  Thus several reviewers have remarked that Mel Gibson has utterly failed in his project by not placing the story of Christ's final twelve hours into a larger spiritual framework the viewer could walk away with.But there is a second approach.  This approach believes that the Gospel (and the secret of life for that matter) is not a collection of spiritual wisdom or a code of ethics and conduct.  This approach believes that the secret of life is a person.  In other words, Christ did not come to walk among us to get us to be better people or live on a higher spiritual standard.  Christ came to reconcile us to Himself.  He came so that we could place our trust in Him and trust in His righteousness to make us acceptable to a Holy God.  In this view, Gibson's movie makes sense.  The whole drawn out tale of the suffering Jesus makes sense because Jesus Himself is the point.It offends many that this one man in one particular time and concrete place is believed to be the meaning of it all.  It defies all reason and common sense.  Yet this is what the faith proclaims.  Hence at least some of the criticism this film has received is actually an expression of outrage at this very suggestion.There have been some complaints that in this version of Jesus' death that the Roman Governor, Pilate, is viewed with some sympathy.  Indeed, I think Gibson has done just that.  But whatever sympathy Gibson shows for Pilate is offset by the ghastly brutality of the Roman soldiers.  And troubled or not, Pilate cannot absolve himself of his part in the crucifixion by washing his hands anymore than he can declare himself a bird and fly away.At the viewing I attended, the audience was dead quiet throughout the entire film.  No one ate and only a few bothered to drink their sodas-those that did did so only to calm the upset in their stomachs.  Surprisingly, the toughest part of the film was not the hanging on the cross but when Jesus is beaten with a variety of whips.  To watch a man have the skin ripped from his body is an astoundingly harsh experience for the viewer.  It is with this particularly long scene in mind that I cannot recommend this film to younger filmgoers.This is a painful film to watch.  Most of the audience cried at some point.  A few had to leave the theater.  When it was over the audience walked out not speaking to each other.  This film is meaningful in the extreme to Christians long familiar with the habits of Lent and Easter.  It is definitely a Catholic view of the crucifixion-even so, it is not so oppressively Catholic that members of other denominations would find it distracting.  Most leave this film deeply moved and without regret for having watched it.Only time will tell if this film will have a lasting place among Christians.  I can scarcely imagine what place it will have in the world of filmmaking.  There is no other film like it.  The only film I have heard it compared to is Schnildler's List in its depiction of brutality.  It could be for that very reason it will be ignored in the long run by the film watching public.  Like Schnildler's List, it may be more honored than watched.  But this is an important film as a film.  And if you are a believer it will knock the wind out of you."	5.0	LORD OF THE DANCE THIS IS NOT	2004-03-05	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A16ZFFYQ98RGX2	Craig Collins	When I went to see this movie in theaters, I knew that it wasn't going to be a very pretty movie, due to the trailers and TV spots I had seen. As the movie progressed, I was kind of regretting that I had decided to go to this movie, and at the same time, I was glad I went. This movie mainly focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. First we see him praying, then he gets taken away, and, well, I don't want to ruin the whole movie for those of you who haven't yet seen it. I am very anxious to get this movie on DVD this tuesday. If you are an Adult, I wouldn't really recommend showing this movie to your child, unless you really feel that they should see it. When the movie is over, try to put what they saw into context and tell them why it happened. Being a kid, that movie was a little much for me, and I'm not really sure If I'll be able to sit through it again.	4.0	A gripping, emotional film	2004-08-28	1	0	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"GOOD - Kudos for someone finally presenting an accurate account of Christ's sufferings, as gruesome and horrible as they were, although, if you read the Gospel accounts in the Bible, it was even worse than shown on this film. Jesus' face was beaten to a pulp and ""unrecognizable"" so keep that in mind if you think the film overdid the beatings. However, the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film; it's an according-to-the-Book account and after you see this on film, it shakes you up.I heard that people were so stunned they couldn't speak for about a half hour after coming out of the theaters. I thought that was probably exaggerated, but it wasn't. I felt the same way, just stunned at what I had witnessed. As a Believer, it was something I needed to see to remind me of what this God-in the flesh human voluntarily went through. For non-Believers, scoffers or whatever, I don't know what your reaction was to the film but for me, it was a humbling, sobering experience.THE BAD - The unrelenting brutality against Jesus the last three-quarters of this film is so bad that, frankly, I would hesitate before ever watching this again. One viewing is enough. I am amazed so many people sat through this, including Christians. I wish director/producer Mel Gibson had shown more of Christ's resurrection instead of centering 99 percent of this movie on his suffering, although I understand Mel's point. However, all of Jesus' claims and sufferings are meaningless without the resurrection, so why not emphasize that instead of just tacking it on for the last minute or two? Just asking.It's a clich&eacute;, but this is a film you won't soon forget, but I would add to that, one you probably won't want to watch multiple times."	3.0	The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of The Christ'	2007-09-07	6	4	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	I found this to be a moving and powerful film.  Mel Gibson has made a film that shows us just a portion of what Christ suffered for mankind.  (It is important to remember that the word passion has a root that means suffering.)  If you don't believe or don't know the story the violence might be all you can see.  However, I saw Jesus reaching out with love, trying to teach, through all the torture and barbarity even while on the cross.  Tears come easily while watching this film because I know my sins put the whips and hammers in my hands and that Jesus was wounded for my transgressions, bruised for my iniquities, and that with his stripes I am healed.James Caviezel certainly portrays the suffering of Jesus, but more importantly he also always projects the absolute submission Jesus has to God's will and his boundless love for every human.  I particularly loved the scene where the man who had been compelled to carry Christ's cross to Golgotha looks into the eyes of Jesus and is tormented because of the love Christ still radiates.  I remember one of the negative reviewers said that the words of Christ asking his Father to forgive his tormenters (us) were not in the film.  That is wrong.  They are in there twice, when he is being nailed to the cross on the ground and another time shortly before he dies.The other actors are fine as well.  Hristo Shopov was very fine as Pontius Pilate as was Claudia Gerini as Pilate's troubled wife.  Monica Bellucci adds a haunting beauty as Mary Magdalene.  However, top honors goes to Maia Morgenstern as Mary.  She brings Mary to life as I have never seen before.  And when she looks straight in our eyes as she holds the broken body of her son you know she is not condemning us.  No, she is asking us to understand what her son (and she) gave for us and asks us to accept that sacrifice and let it change our lives.The actors who played the priests, the vicious Roman guards, and the crowds who called for Jesus' death should all be commended for powerfully playing those thankless roles.  They contributed so much to the film in such a difficult roles that I just want to say thank you to them.	5.0	Powerful, moving, and full of love	2004-09-06	20	12	8

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1Z54EM24Y40LL	csm	Words just fail me as a journalist in describing this movie. You just have to go and see it and run, don't walk. If you're a Christian, it will deepen your faith. If it doesn't affect you in some manner, then you should check yourself to see if you're alive. This is by far the most intense movie I've ever seen, but in a great way. It will change your life and move you to examine where your life is headed and where you've been. I was afraid to see it but knew that I must. Now, I just cannot tell you enough about it. The symbolism is amazing throughout the movie and the mother/son scenes are just something else. If you're a mother and particularly of boys, it will really make you sob. Gibson really showed Mary's perspective of what it meant to lose her Son. Jesus died for us and when you see how horrifically He did, then you'll have a decision to make. I'd never seen a cat of nine-tails before this movie and hope I never do again.In addition, my particular favorite part of the movie is in the beginning when Jesus stomps on a snake! Awesome! Even as Christians we need to be reminded of that power every now and then! The ending is amazing and I won't ruin it if you haven't seen it. This movie is just amazing - you'll sob your eyes out and it will leave you speechless. It's sometimes very difficult to describe the things of the heart and this is definitely one of those times. But honestly, I don't think I could ever watch it again.  It's that intense and difficult to take and to realize that it really happened.  Highly recommend but not for the faint of heart.	5.0	Words really cannot describe the depth of this film	2005-03-07	4	3	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A11B61QBGHLQDN	C. Stephans	Gibson's Passion portrays the suffering of Christ as well as I could imagine it being done in a film.  His goal is to show the audience what Christ endured on our behalf, and I think he has done it.The torture, bloodshed and cruelty are shocking and offensive, but that is the way it happened.  This is what Christ experienced in the final hours of his suffering on earth.  The mocking of the Romans, the accusations of the Jewish leaders, the conflicts of his disciples, and the love for Jesus by the mass of people are all portrayed.The effects of flashbacks during the film to Jesus as a boy, young man, and times with his disciples emphasize his humanness and relationships.  The focus on Mary and her love for her son is gripping as we are forced to consider that Jesus is her child whom she has cared for.We see the anguish Christ faces when in the garden contemplating the suffering ahead of him.  Satan is present there and throughout the film to tempt and ridicule Jesus.  All of the time, Jesus keeps his eyes on his Father and the mission he is accomplishing for all people.The film makes it apparent that at anytime Christ could have ended it all my calling on God for angels or my using his power to stop it.  As we see in the garden, even as he is being arrested he heals the soldiers ear.  Although there were several players involved, we see that no person caused Christ death, but he gave his own life.The fact that the language is aramaic and latin is not bothersome at all and I think it adds to the profundity of the words spoken.I can't imagine this movie being done better that it has been done.  It completely fulfills the goals set for it: to display the suffering of Christ and the love in his heart.	5.0	Stunning and accurate portrayal	2005-01-25	19	13	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A114WO9CT1HK4O	C. Taylor	"Purely from the point of view of watching the movie it was amazing.  The film costs here were amazingly well spent (thats what the stars are for).  To film a movie in Latin and Aramaic was brilliant and the sets and costumes were amazing.  I think they could have saved about half the movie budget by having Jesus expend a human amount of blood but that's ok -I realize it was necessary for Gibson to stay true to his fundamentalist Catholic views and strictly follow the stations of the cross in depicting the passion of Christ, even though there is no scriptural evidence for them.  Having said this though it is important to point out what a horrible theology this movie presents.  It is essentially the Anselmian view that Jesus was incarnated as the only sufficient sacrifice for our sins.  As this movie presents it the only significant part of Jesus's life is his death.  It is this sort of blood-soaked religious ideology that says it is ok to kill people as a means of purification.Even as an atheist I can see that this is probably the most immoral of all ethical or religious doctrines.  If you want a sound theology try Abelard or some of the Franciscan authors.  In their writings the incarnation is the culmination of creation, an event that was planned from the beginning and NOT simply a reaction to ""people behaving badly"".  It represents the ultimate unification of God with His creation.  The moral lesson comes not from the death of Jesus saving us from our sins.  (which mires human beings in eternal stupidity and doesn't apparently cure us of sinfulness either ...so it is pretty much a wash) The moral message needs to come from Jesus's life...take care of lepers, eat with tax collectors, help a prostitute get on her feet.  Things get a little messed up but its not anything that cannot be fixed by simply doing human things."	2.0	Theologically impoverished but an amazing spectacle	2005-12-05	28	7	21

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AAPA4KQWA7UXN	cvairag	"What I liked most about this film was its unpretentiousness.  The film doesn't pretend to be anymore than it is: a thorough examination of Christ's passion through graphic (one could not exactly say literal)depiction. Because of the film's intense focus, I gained a much deeper understanding of what exactly the passion of the Divine Christ was: His absolute, uncompromising, and, most of all, completely self-sacrificing love for humanity.By focusing on the essence of Christ's mission, in a brilliant exposition of the film-maker's art - we are shown the exemplication and demonstration of perfect self-sacrificing love, the true Altruism, which He was sent into this world to teach, and the intolerably brutal and vicious way in which we treated Him.To the credit of the film, we are not allowed for a second to forget that God's begotten Son took upon Himself the form of a man, and therefore, was subject to that human sensitivity which experiences pain and travail. And who among us, with all the agony we do experience, could have endured what He did for our sake?  Herein, the film shows us what Christian virtue is: to bear our Cross, without complaint or rebuke.  The film really does a superb work in showing us that Christ's passion for our betterment was great enough to transcend any agony which we could inflict upon the flesh.I understand the heart of Christ's teaching as stated in the Gospel of John to be thus:1) ""... that you love each other as I have loved you ..."";2) that ""... there is no greater love than this: that one might lay down their life for their friends (or enemies, or anyone at all)...""What I don't understand is how one can watch this film and point a finger at anyone, Jew, Roman, Iraqi ... anyone, other than at themselves.  I cannot speak for anyone other than myself. I see a lot of people really trying hard to live Christ's teaching, Christian and non-Christian alike.  But, I, for one, know if someone hit me with one of those scourging whips what would happen. I cannot speak for you or anyone else, but the film makes me lament that I am far . . . far away from the passionate love of my fellows that Christ died see in every person, and lives to see in so few, or any real sense of that truly unselfish . . . selfless . . . contrition that He might deem holy, or even acceptable.-"	5.0	"""KNOW THAT THE WORLD HATED ME . . ."""	2004-03-07	4	1	3

As an atheist, I wondered what affect it would have on me. Now that I've seen it, the main thing that strikes me is how very unmoved I was by it. It certainly has great production values. Very impressive cinematography! It's got plenty of lyricism in its directing and editing. I'd heard it was reminiscent of Kurosawa, and it is. But this lyricism robs it of some of its emotional immediacy. Big mistake. Despite the impressive technique, the actual telling of the story is very straight forward. Yes, it's just another Passion Play, with a big budget for fake blood. Of course, Gibson couldn't get too imaginative or creative with it, lest he deviate from the source material. The Gospels are just (supposed) histories, not stories dreamt up for our entertainment. Hence, they can be difficult to fit into a movie format. Kudos for historical accuracy, but the more important question is, did Gibson emotionally connect the viewer with Jesus, so we personally felt he died to pay for our own sins? That may vary with each viewer. I felt no connection at all. Gibson tried a few skillful tricks in order to make the connection, but they didn't work for me. The lyricism I mentioned earlier detracted from an immediate connection. Maybe Gibson got a bit too wraped up with his own snazzy filmmaking technique. Personally, I thought ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" was a much more compelling Passion Play film. Gibson gave it the best shot a religious film maker possibly could, but in the end, a myth is still just a myth."	3.0	"""King Of Kings"" with lots of red paint"	2004-02-29	7	0	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3TOG8CNFB369F	DailoFan	While this is a powerful movie and very dramatically acted, I think it misses the major point of Jesus on the cross.  The director seems so obsessed with portraying physical pain and suffering inflicted by humans (which he does gruesomely well) that he fails to show Jesus's major reason for suffering.It was Jesus's brief seperation from God the Father on the cross that was far more terrible than any physical suffering.  This was his sacrifice so we can be forgiven for our sins.  After spending all eternity in loving company together, that period when God cut him off emotionally was pure hell.  The same hell that we put ourselves through in life when we isolate ourselves from God's love.I appreciate the effort of Gibson, but I think the film falls fall short.	2.0	Misses the Whole POINT of Christ!	2004-10-03	13	7	6

This film touched me like no other film EVER has.  On more than one occasion I was moved to tears, and I came away spiritually renewed.Is this film violent?  Yes, the violence in this film is very unsettling as you witness the beating, scourging and crucifixion of Christ.  However, I believe that the violence is justified; Gibson wanted to give as accurate a portrayal as he believed he could to show the magnitude of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, and to do anything less would not have done the film justice.Is the film anti-Semitic? Absolutely not.  Anyone who sees this as a slight against Jews misses the entire point of the film, as well as Gibson's motivation for making it.  ""The Passion"" is not anti-Semitic.  It is pro-love.""The Passion"" is also beautifully acted, and Jim Caviezel should win every award in the country for his portrayal of Jesus.  Here's an actor who shows that he not afraid to take chances, not I'm not talking about choosing to play the Messiah.  Caviezel reportedly suffered pneumonia, a lung infection, suffered a 14-inch gash across his back from being accidentally scourged, and was even struck by lightning during filming.  This guy deserves an Oscar just on general principle!  Having the dialogue in Aramaic and Latin was not only a stroke of artistic genius on Gibson's part, but it further added to the film's overall authenticity.  Gibson knew exactly how he wanted this film to be done.  For that, he is more than just an actor/director/producer.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2V7B4H53VNRDH	Dana W.	"This movie deals with Christ's suffering at the end of his earthly life. Those who expect a more comprehensive, ""balanced"" view of Jesus's earthly experiences are going to be disappointed.  Yes, this movie is violent and bloody, but not as difficult to watch as I expected after hearing so many prior comments on that aspect of the film.It is helpful, in preparation for watching the film, to be familiar with the biblical account, found in the latter part of any of the four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.Other parts of the Bible offer background to certain parts of the movie. For example, the opening scene in the garden featuring the serpent draws from Genesis 3:15, where God says to Satan ""I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."" Plus, the dark figure who shows up in the crowds throughout the film is explained by Ephesians 2:2 ""...the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.""  There are also modest embellishments in the movie which are not in the Bible.Why focus on the death of Christ, when he is widely regarded as such a great teacher?  Christians believe Jesus was the sacrificial ""lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world"" as he was described in John 1:29.  To be willing to die sacrificially is remarkable itself; to do so as God, at the hands of your creation, and as the object of such sadism and disrespect, is astonishing.  After all, if he was God, he could have put a stop to it at any time.  Yet Isaiah 53:7,8 says ""He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.  By oppression and judgment, he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendents?  For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken."" The power of the film is that Christ's sacrifice was not cheap or easy.As you watch the film, note the lessons taught in the flashbacks to Jesus's life of teaching. He knew what was going to happen at the end of his life. John 2:18-22 recounts ""Then the Jews demanded of him, 'What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?'  Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.'  The Jews replied, 'It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?'  But the temple he had spoken of was his body.  After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said.  Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.""The movie is not anti-Semitic, nor should anyone blame Jews for Jesus's death.  Trying to blame any group of people for what happened misses the point of individual personal responsibility. There were individual Romans and individual Jews who tried to resist Jesus's railroading, but those in power, both Jew and Gentile (Roman), didn't want anyone challenging their autonomy and authority, and all dissenters were overrun.Neither should anyone dwell on Mel Gibson and his motivations for making this film.  After all, do we critique Harrison Ford because he is best known for fantasy action movies, or Fancis Ford Coppola because many of his movies deal with darkness and violence?  Instead, judge this movie for what it is, not who made it or his other movies or beliefs.In summary, this is a film of powerful contrast between the love of Jesus and the evil hearts of mankind."	5.0	The movie is called The PASSION of the Christ	2004-02-27	1	1	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2S26YGNWHP7UI	"DancesWithAnxiety ""chewtoy to the Fates"""	"I watched this movie with an open mind as to the charges of anti-semitism made against it. I find these charges ridiculous. This movie makes no accusation against ""the Jews"" except for that which the stupidly literal-minded or the already inclined would read into it. Instead it portrays the abuses one should reasonably expect when religious and political leadership is too intermingled, and given the time and place, the intolerant religious fanatics in the movie happen to be Jews. I didn't like religious fanaticism before this movie, and this movie affirmed my distrust of it; my opinion of ""the Jews"" was unchanged.I also tried, as a non-believer, to allow the film to do what it could to win me over to Christianity. I find it offered me nothing at all. It gave me two hours of a man being tortured to death, unencumbered by context. Who is this? What did he do wrong? Who are those arrayed against him? What is the nature of the conflict? This film doesn't bother with these questions. Certainly the film provokes sympathy for the Jesus character and his mother, but without context, it generates nothing beyond sadness and pity. As I don't understand Aramaic or Latin, I was left to abet the grisly presentation with what I could gather from the visible spectacle and what I already knew about the story. My reading of this cinematic Rorschach inkblot showed religious fanatics combining forces with political opportunists to destroy an apparently guiltless man. What I already knew about the story had already failed to win me to Christian cosmology, so all this film did was supply a great deal of visual detail on aspects of the story that are better left vague.Sorry, fanatical Christians, but beating, whipping, and crucifixion doesn't prove the victim's divinity, and does nothing to establish the validity of his teachings; the Romans nailed a lot of people to boards, and none of them were gods. Theologically, Mel Gibson is preaching only to the converted here, and for everyone else, this is just a prurient representation of religiously- and politically-motivated cruelty. Whatever dark part of me that enjoys watching a man tortured to death is not, I would hope, a part of me that's close to any actual deity or true faith. It's difficult to imagine a less appealing piece of evangelism than The Passion of the Christ, but the spectacle of professed Christians heaping praise on it comes close."	2.0	Prurience makes for poor evangelism	2004-09-03	34	15	19

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1PLRDMBCSULMI	Daniel Ferrisi	"Mel Gibson's new film The Passion of the Christ has been greeted with as much controversy and anticipation as any film has been in years. And though this guarantees the film will make huge sums of money from the curious public, it also allows religion and theological clashes to overshadow what the analysis should be focused upon for any cinematic offering: the filmmaking. In that respect, The Passion of the Christ is very similar to recent critical-favorite Touching the Void. For the former, we see an hour of ""real time"" scourging, torture and crucifixion. The latter limits itself to about an hour of battling the elements, as a horribly injured man attempts to descend a perilous mountain. The problem in both cases is that an ordeal on film is made to be an ordeal for the audience, as well. Frankly put, too much of the same thing eventually becomes boring.The film begins with terrific atmosphere, as Jesus (Jim Caviezel), who claims to be the son of God, prays in a mystical forest under the guard of his disciples. Jesus knows that the Jewish authority, the Pharisees, believe he is a blasphemer and want him dead. As such, he prays to God mournfully as the specter of Satan attempts to turn him toward the dark side while Jesus is at his most vulnerable. Eventually, the Pharisees seize Jesus and a brief battle ensues. Jesus shakes the determination of one Jewish guard when he magically restores the guard's severed ear.The Pharisees eventually bring Jesus to the Roman ruler of the land, Pontius Pilate, demanding he be crucified for going against their established religious hierarchy. Pilate is extraordinarily conflicted about Jesus, seeming to believe in the qualities Jesus claims to possess. He sends the Pharisees away to seek the rule of Herod instead of his own, though Herod promptly refuses to condemn Jesus and he is sent back to Pilate by the increasingly bloodthirsty mob. Knowing that refusal to follow the will of the people would create a rebellion, Pilate begrudgingly sends Jesus to be scourged. However, even that is not enough for the accusers, led by Caiphas.What follows are essentially: 20 minutes of scourging, 20 minutes of bearing the cross up a hill, and 20 minutes of actual crucifixion. The film currently runs a bit more than two hours and gets tedious; trimming several minutes off the hill walk and a bit from the crucifixion would certainly improve the film's pacing. The visuals are indeed incredible, making us feel as though we are actually in the time and place of the events (the Director of Photography and Production Designer deserve recognition here), but even imagistic richness is not enough to counter endless repetition of the same thing.The same criticism can even be levied against Caviezel, as well as Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci (Mary and Mary-Magdalene, respectively). Though Caviezel totally embodies him here, Jesus spends much of the movie wincing, collapsing or heaving. Both Marys have little to do but cry as they watch the torture unfold. Morgenstern has an expressive face and captures the idea of a mother's grief well, but neither she, nor in particular Bellucci, have a whole lot to do in the movie.Mel Gibson's direction is incredible for visual splendor, but his ideas for pacing and variety leave much to be desired. Though the final moments of the film are uplifting ones, as we do see Jesus come back to life after his corpse was entombed, it seems Gibson's vision for the film was limited to the torture Jesus endured for his beliefs. Though it is no consolation to a bored audience, one can only expect singular focus from such a narrow vision.Regardless of what people may be saying, The Passion of the Christ is certainly not a life-altering experience. It is quite simply an artist's interpretation, of writers' interpretations, of ancient stories. As such, there is no reason for adults to bring children to the film in the guise that it is instructional. This R-rated film is certainly more deserving of an NC-17 than The Dreamers. Far from the stylized mayhem of Kill Bill: Volume 1, this is pure and unadulterated torture that perhaps should have remained limited to the world of nightmares.Final Grade: B-"	3.0	A Good Movie, NOT a Life-Altering Experience	2004-02-29	15	9	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A399YBER387BC6	Daniel	"I went and saw this move earlier this week, and because I had known people who had gone to see it before, I thought that from what they said, I knew what to expect. However I was mistaken. This film is by far the most emotional that I have ever witnessed, and to anyone who sees it, it is probably the most important they will see in their lives. I felt so small and insignificant to the things happening on the screen, they were out of my control. Things that I didn't want to happen did, even though I knew they were coming.But for all the hundreds(soon to be thousands)of reviews that I've overviewed on this website, not one mentioned the last thirty seconds of the film. That was the pennicle, the moment that I, as a Christian, place my faith in. For the most part I feel that the film did not entirely capture the reality of the Gospels, even though it was very gory, somehow I feel it wasn't gory enough to be compared with reality.  There I believe was the only place that the film drew a little short. Anyone who views this story as only a part, or 'not the entire story' is plainly and simply wrong. This point was the entire climax of the Bible. The Old Testament built up to this point, The Gospels build up to this point, but the finale of the Bible is yet to come. Jesus' return.I kept thinking during the scenes with Pilate and Caiphas about how people had thought the film was anti-Semitic, and I would agree with that, only if they agreed that Schinler's List is anti-Germanic, or that The Lord of the Rings is anti-Sauronic. But to say that a film promotes anti-Semitism is just ridiculous, but that is only my opinion.All in all I gave the film five stars because of its bravery, and most importantly, its message. Someone who watches this film and says, ""It's only a movie."" May be the same person who one day picks up the Bible and says, ""It's only a book."" Don't analyze, just absorb. Absorb the message and the things surrounding it, don't discard it and say it's worth nothing because it's only a movie. It is the closest thing to the real thing we will probably ever see in our lives. Shouldn't we understand that?"	5.0	The Suffering of the Messiah	2004-03-15	1	0	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1DKUXY2DE0EDY	Daniel	WOW! This film is the best film I have ever seen on Earth! It was [way] better than Titanic (no offense Titanic fans)! Finally, I get to see what this film... or this true story looks like. First of all, this isn't a film. It was REAL!!! Big time! Now for my review. This movie opens up with Jesus (my favorite character... or person...) who is upset that he has twelve hours to live, because he is about to be crucified. Hours have passed and he was taken to the Romans. After they sentence to punish him, they start beating him up with chains, whips, and other dangerous weapons. I covered my eyes, because it was too painful. After they beat him up, they want to sentence him to death. So they have him carry a cross, while he is severely injured, but Mary thinks about the good times Jesus and her spend, including the close encounter part which really brought a tear in my eye. When we get there, they nailed Jesus on the cross and raise him up, but not before we see a flashback about his bread as his body and the drink as his blood. After he and his cross rose vertically, they knew the job was done, and everyone laughed at him. However, they clouds rolled in, and everyone knew what will happen: After Jesus prays to his father for the last time, he dies and he will be in heaven for sure. Rain starts to fall, causing a huge earthquake. Now, I think this is a little... flat, but the people who crucified Jesus NOW finally realized they did something wrong. They knew they did something bad to him, but it was too late for that. After they release Jesus from the cross, he is held by his mother, Mary. However, in April 3, the first Easter ever to be created, the covers he lied in when he died was empty, because Jesus is living with his father, but, before the credits roll, we see Jesus resurrected, proving that even though he died, he was still alive. I think the ending was so powerful, and, in my opinion, I think it was the best ending ever. It left my heart thumping for good. The only complaint was that there was no English dialouge, but there's not suppose to be an English dialouge, because it wasn't held in our region. I still think it makes sense to me. This movie is the best movie I've seen in Earth, and it should not be missed. GO SEE IT NOW!!! Well done Mel Gibson for giving us the gift of a powerful movie!!! And thank you Jesus for doing this for us. I will always love you!	5.0	Powerful! Extremely Powerful!!!	2004-03-21	2	0	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A13RM1AWD1C5ZR	Daniel K.	"The Passion of the Christ, the very controversial Mel Gibson religious epic has been highly anticipated and now released.  I had the priviledge of seeing last night and was not disappointed, but I should point out that this is the kind of film which you can't ""like"" or ""dislike.""  The film stays true or mostly true to the Gospel it's based upon.  The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children.  Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney's engrossing music score.  James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others.  Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart.  I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel.  Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life, he's not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend.  It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film's budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film.  This is the second-highest grossing ""R"" rated film after The Matrix Reloaded.  Of course you shouldn't see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you're very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence.  The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal.  During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus's hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus's body is drenched with blood.  There's also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.  Though the film's violence might derive you from seeing this film, you should definetly experience especially at the movie theatre.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2GYX971VETQBV	Daniel R. Sanderman	"Well, at the time I am writing this, over 1,800 people have written reviews on THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  Now, regardless of whether these reviewers think the film is good or not, I think it is absolutely dishonest to say that the film is completely not worth seeing.  Any film that manages to spark so much controversy and polarize audiences is bound to be worth seeing-if only to get a glimpse for yourself of what people are talking about.  So, unlike most of my reviews, I will say upfront: THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is worth seeing.  In what follows, I will give you a sense of my thoughts as I was watching the film.During my childhood, I was a practicing Catholic and attended mass every week (often twice).  Each year, we would go through the Passion meticulously around Easter.  The story would be related several times, the stations of the cross would be observed, and so forth.  The upshot is, this is a story that any practicing Christian should know like the back of his or her hand.  Yet, despite the fact that I have heard this story so many times and seen so many films about it, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST manages to bring a different perspective and a whole-new-level of reality to the story that just cannot be communicated in spoken words.  Sure, I sat there waiting for each of the stations to occur.  I waited for the lines.  If you grew up in a church, you will know several of the film's lines before they are uttered.But I would like to focus on the film's graphic violence, since this seems to strike the largest amount of controversy in the entire movie.  Is it violent?  Yes, it is.  I would not recommend this movie for children.  But I don't know what everyone is so upset about.  The Passion is a violent story.  The brutality is described in the New Testament and, until Gibson decided to go for it, that brutality has never adequately reached the screen.  The story is supposed to center on Jesus, a man who is human and divine, suffering for all of the sins of humankind.  His suffering has to be greater than any other human being is capable of withstanding.  In previous films and versions, the lack of absolute brutality allows the audience to sit back and ""enjoy"" the Passion.  But this is not a story that is meant to be enjoyed.  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, in my opinion, is the only film that really ""gets"" that.  Gibson's ""bloodbath"" finally communicates, in horrifying detail, the absolute suffering of Jesus Christ.Now, regardless of whether you are a ""believer,"" I think you will get something out of this film.  I am no longer a practicing Catholic, but that doesn't prevent me from standing back in thoughtful contemplation after this film.  It is a good film and it is obviously a labor of love.  I think that it will stand the test of time and provide a powerful religious experience for those who are believers.  Some have complained that it doesn't preach ""Christian"" values.  If you think this, you are blind.  The quiet suffering of a man dying for the sins of humankind, praying for his torturers, is at the heart of the Christian faith.  Do not watch THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST to be entertained.  Watch it either to reflect on your own beliefs or to reflect on the beliefs of those around you in our society."	4.0	The Passion: An Intense Depiction Unlike Any Other	2005-10-21	22	18	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2EQ03YRNHBJUM	Dan W. Welch	"The Passion of the Christ displays an idea of the scriptural description of Christ's crucifixion with astounding accuracy.  In viewing the film, one senses the true meaning of the word ""awesome"" which has in recent days become trivialized to describing rock bands and sports feats.  I felt a personal conviction in re-examining my own thoughts as to Jesus costly sacrifice for my sins.  His crucifixion was a result of the sins of all mankind in general, and my own in specific.As to anti-semitism, the film in no way would place blame on the jews for Jesus sacrifice.  The blame is shared by all of us who are and have been upon the face of the Earth. Had I been there in that age, my own sins would dictate that I put him to death as his perfection threatens my utter sinfulness. The decision of God to sacrifice his only begotten Son speaks of his Love to us all as Jesus laid down his life by his own will and desire to obey God.  No man took His life, He willingly gave it to save all whom would believe.  It also clearly displays the fact that the first peoples to believe that Jesus was the Christ were in fact Jewish.  The Old Testment, as Christians would call it, prophesied the coming of the Messiah.I remember that one of the things that was chanted at the release of Barabbas by the congregation demanding Jesus' crucifixion was, ""His blood be on our heads!""  While at the time this was meant to show Pontius Pilate that those wanting his crucifixion would willingly, before God, show that they were serious about blasphemy and by not tolerating it in the one that they perceived as a blasphemer would please God and that they would be judged as having made a righteous decision in the destruction of such a one.  In fact, the Blood that was on their heads, became blood not of condemnation, but of Salvation for all whom later believed in the diety of Jesus, the Son of God."	5.0	Passionate Sacrifice	2004-02-28	1	1	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1PTDFCMGB43C0	dark hore dissent	There's so much debate about the violence of this movie that it may scare some from watching it. But Mel Gibson makes it known that he doesn't want to elaborate on the physical suffering of Jesus as much as he wants to elaborate on the courage and strength of Jesus to do God's will. Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe. But the last scene of Jesus resurrection gives hope and almost purges those feelings of despair. This movie depicts true Love and Hope through even the most darkest hours. Other than some rather cheesy scenes and some overdramatic irony the movie should remain a classic for it's indie aspirations and block buster accomplishments.	4.0	the passion and ressurection	2004-09-30	9	7	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2E5IH8Y70PUGA	Darren D. Wheeler	"I will say up front that I am a Christian... a devout Christian. Therefore, know my perspective when watching this movie and giving it my review.I want to address what I hear said by a lot of people, that being the graphic violence portrayed in the movie.I, like most people, cringe at the thought of those bloody, gory scenes that are in so many movies these days. In fact, I won't watch nor allow in my home a ""slasher"" movie. There is pretty graphic violence depicted in this movie, and I can't bring myself to look at it when it is taking place. But I do want to address why I think it should be in the movie.So many movies have been made over time, and so many paintings have been created, all to recreate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Most often He is depicted as having little-to-no wounds and with a small trickle of blood running down his forehead.That depiction is so inaccurate. The Bible tells of what happened when He was scourged and history teaches us of how Roman scourging was so horrific.God took the form of man in order to become the final and eternal blood sacrifice for all sin; past, present and future. Satan, in battling with Jesus, had the most horrific pain imaginable inflicted upon Him. For many people there has been no knowledge nor appreciation of exactly what that entailed. And to be perfectly honest, the scourging depicted in ""The Passion Of The Christ"" probably did not go to the full depth of damage inflicted.This movie is the first that really gives one an idea of just how bad it was. No, it isn't at all pleasant. I can't and won't watch when that part of the movie plays. But the entire time it is happening my mind and my heart are thinking, reflecting on my own life, on the mercy and grace and love of God and a more clear understanding of what really did take place and that it was done for my salvation... and for yours.I highly recommend this movie."	5.0	Kudos to Mel Gibson	2009-04-03	1	0	1

Well, the truth is out there and for alittle less then $10 you can see it on the great silver screen.

Also Mr. Gibson declares in the most profound and honest way that not just jews or gentiles are at fault for Jesus's death but we ALL are at fault.This movie declares what many missionaries go with their own lives at stake to declare the gospel and say that Christ died for our sins and we are only saved by the grace and love that took Him to that hill and pinned him to his death.  The movie does start at the climax of what happened to Christ, yet it shows in such horrific detail what Christ went through for out transgressions.  In the most true solidarity and painful humbleness.  I found myself in many ways coming out of Mr. Gibson's movie saying exactly what the Pope said.  It is what it was whether we in our own human nature want to express our shame and utter disgusting human nature also known as fallen nature or not this movie shows exactly to what extent love can truly be portrayed in the most pure way.  Christ loves us and if we accept that He died for us then we have eternal life and that is what this movie made me truly understand and believe.  Praise be to God for giving Gibson the courage and strength to make such a movie.  Now we all need to stop pointing fingers at him and look at our own selves.  That is my point of view and I stick to it.  God Bless&lt;>&lt;  DZ"	5.0	The Truth is Out there....	2004-04-05	3	2	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	"The Passion Of The Christ is perfect on every level...it is beautifully acted, the scenery and landscape is gorgeous, the story line is tight and well shot, the music is great, and it is filled with emotion.  You seem to forget that it is not in English because of the breathtaking cinematography.  I sat on the edge of my seat the whole movie and could not keep my eyes off of it.  Basically, this is one of those movies that impact your life.  Somehow, this movie did not win the Oscar for Best Picture (actually, it is not surprising because liberal Hollywood would rather push Brokeback the next year saying it has beautiful scenery or push Crash the next year because it has emotion).  And to anyone who says it is too violent and too graphic, I'm pretty sure that the crucifixion was probably worse than what we saw.  And these are probably the same people who see the goriest movies around just for shock value.  Mel Gibson is an excellent director and has always allowed us to seem like we are part of the movie.  And the fact that we are watching a depiction of what our Savior went through, anything ""violent"" means that much more.  Jesus did not die an easy death - it was uncomfortably brutal.  That is more reason that we should examine our own lives everyday.  And think about it...what other movie can make you say that?  Lastly, Caviezel (who should have won Best Actor - somehow somebody imitating Ray Charles is a bigger accomplishment than somebody portraying Jesus!  Come on!!!) is extraordinary and I hope this is not the last we see of Mel Gibson and Caviezel!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1KLJA9E10SAGP	Dave B	After reading the (majority) of glowing reviews here,and read,and heard the hype,I was needless to say expecting an experience when I finally saw this movie(...).I did get one,but not as I hoped.For me,the only things that made the movie not quite as powerful and moving as it could have been,allthough don't get me wrong,it certainley was those two things and many more,was as follows.For one,I felt that some of the subttitles used too modern words such as 'he's crazy' for example,I felt that detracted from the realism,because 2000 or so years ago surel ey words like that would not have existed,but using'dead' languages though was a masterstroke.Being picky,I know but,allthough Jim Cavieziel gave an amazing performance as christ,I just expected him to have a more 'holy' aura about him,but on the other hand,maybe the message that Christ was a man suffering was the explanation for that .Finally,I think that the rest of the cast were all excellent,but just needed more time to show interaction in more flashbacks just to REALLY tug at your heartstrings even more,maybe .THOSE small criticisms aside,I am really glad I saw this powerful,gutwrenching movie,and we will want too see it AGAIN defentiley.Then 2nd time I might give 5 stars.The score is good,cinematography sometimes beautiful but nevertheless still bloody and shocking.Before I say this,Remember that I am not practising any religon,so CANNOT comment on the film's accuracy,but I think I can sort of see what Mr.Gibson is trying to do here.The film going public are mainly the'Pulp Fiction' generation,violence in films has to be really bad if you are too get these desensitized minds to take notice of a serious point on celluloid you are trying to get across!I felt there was a sense of anger in this film,sort of'LOOK THIS IS  HOW  HE SUFFERED,TAKE NOTICE,EVEN  IF I HAVE TOO SHOW  YOU THIS HORROR'kind of statement,and I can see really where he is going,if,of course if I have perceived this correctly.But that means  nothing too some,but the fact that I even felt the need to sit here and write this says something about the movie.See it.Think .Decide for yourself.	4.0	Almost a masterpiece( to me personally)	2004-04-07	8	7	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	"I'm sitting here a day after having viewed the movie, and I'm still trying to decide how best to describe it. How am I supposed to fit into a puny 1,000 words or less how powerful and amazing this film is? I can't. It's amazing. I'll have to admit (at the cost of my pride) that this film even caused a few tears to stream down my cheeks...something I'm typically determined not to have happen. I've never cried for any other movie, but the utter determination, the love that bound my Savior to the cross was mind-numbing.Yes, it's violent. Frankly, it's landmark for me, being the very first R-rated film I've ever viewed in my life. But it was worth it, I have no regrets. And although you would know the best whether or not you have the intestinal fortitude to watch this, let me just offer you a few of my own reasons why I think you should.Jesus took this punishment for US. YOU should have been bound to that whipping block. I should have. Each and every one of us has sinned against God, and deserves no less than the most painful and brutal death Man can devise, with eternal suffering and condemnation to follow. We deserve that. By God's good grace, we are no longer bound to that doom. If our Savior had what it takes to endure that, to rescue us from that end, it would almost seem to me as if we at least owe him to look squarely in the face that which he endured for us.I've been a Christian all of my life, and generally, I'm guessing it is the case that most people accept the fact that Christ died for us, and we move on. Which is good, of course, don't get me wrong. If we all sat around agape at God's grace, we'd never get any of Heaven's tasks done. But I think the movie changes that acceptance...it forces us to go back and contemplate exactly how difficult of a concept God's grace truly is for our mortal minds to attempt to fathom. It makes us marvel anew. Throughout the film, I kept thinking ""He bore all that for me. For me!""Yes, it's bloody. If you don't think you can watch the film without emblazoning disturbing images on your mind for life, then you probably shouldn't. Jesus died that death specifically so that we needn't suffer it. But I can attest to the fact that I don't think I'll ever picture Christ's death the same way again. To answer the old song's question ""were you there when they crucified my Lord?"", this movie will make you feel as if you were.About those pesky anti-Semitic charges. I'm reminded of the story of Daniel of the Old Testament, wherein Daniel's enemies were searching for a crime to charge Daniel with, but could find none, so they invented one. Besides the violence, anti-Semitism is about the only criticism one can find, and that only because of the hype. (And we all know how concerned Hollywood is about violence!) In truth, the allegation is preposterous. This film is history, dramatized. It is not responsible for stirring up hateful feelings any more than ""The Alamo"" stirs up hatred towards Mexicans, or ""Pearl Harbor"" against the Japanese.So why does this charge still supposedly remain an issue? The fact is, if you enter this film with the predetermined mindset that this film will contain anti-Semitic material, you know what? You could very well see some. I attempted to find some, and you know what? One can; IF YOU ENTERTAIN THE PRESUPPOSTION, then you'll find it. Because there's no doubt; the Jewish leaders were one of the two primary bodies responsible for the death of Jesus. But the Romans share the guilt heavily. They heartlessly scourge Jesus, beat him, mock him. It was a combined effort. But basically, the point is this. If you exit this movie with anti-Semitic tendencies in your heart, then, if you'll forgive the expression, you're dead wrong. You have no appreciation for the love of the Jesus that this movie is about. Also, you need to realize that if you hate those who put Jesus to death, then you hate yourself. It was your sin and mine that held Jesus to that Cross. To claim that it is the sole fault of either the Romans or the Jews is folly. It was our SIN. Yours. Mine. The world's.Like my subject line said, this movie is brutal, visually punishing. It's painful to sit there and watch the nails sink into the Savior's hands and feet. It's terrible, unbearable. But at the same time, the love that held those nails there, the undying love for you and I that kept Jesus on that cross is staggering -- it's beautiful.Bottom line, the movie is quite violent, and I do not recommend that any child under 15 view the movie. But I do think that it is a very important movie, one that can deepen one's understanding of the greatest gift we've been given.25 stars, out of 10."	5.0	Punishing, cruel -- and beautiful	2004-04-11	6	4	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2KB65SOJ51T4C	"David A. Bielby ""Ev Xpistw"""	Every time I see this film I am left in silence, unable to speak.  It is the most powerful film I have ever seen.  The focus of this movie is primarily on the 24 hour period of Jesus' life where he is arrested, tried, sentenced to death and crucified.  Flashbacks to events in the gospels and imagined events in his life provide power allusions that help someone who is unfamiliar with Christianity to capture a little more of who Jesus was.I cannot mark this movie down for the blood and gore because that is the direct subject of this event.  Of all the passion scenes or movies I have seen, this one captures more of what I read in the Bible than any other movie. (I have a bachelors degree in Bible).Let me recommend this film for almost everyone. For those who are having trouble loving difficult people, this movie will change you.  For those who are having trouble forgiving others, this movie will enable you.  Not because of the movie itself, but the content of the script-much of it comes from the Bible and is itself exceptionally powerful.As far as the technical side of the movie.  The music generally enhances every step of the 'Via Dolorosa', and the slow-motion cut ins are not over done in my view.  They enable you to meditate on what is happening.  It's like our souls have been marinated in the power of what Jesus did.For those who are unfamiliar...the movie takes place on the Passover Feast of the Jews.  This feast celebrates the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt.  Another famous movie, The Ten Commandments, has the scene where the Jews put blood on the doorposts of their homes and the death angel passes over them.  On that night the firstborn of Egypt died, and Pharoah finally let Israel go.  It was memorialized as the Passover Feast.  The actual meal was a hastily prepared lamb (blemish free, year old male).Jesus himself is cast as the Passover Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world, but this is never explicitly stated in the movie.  One must know the meaning of the allusions to Passover and to the 'Death Sentence' of Jesus to understand.For Christians who grasp all of this, it is a deeply moving visual impression that causes many of us to consecrate ourselves freshly to God.  That's always been the effect on my spirit as I have seen this incredible movie.I would not recommend it for children under about the age of 8 or 9 because they cannot understand the real meaning of all these things and it is exceptionally graphic at times.If you have avoided this movie because of the graphic nature of it, I think you ought to sit down and watch it, especially during the Easter season. (unless you are under about 9 as I was saying).	5.0	A Spiritual Experience	2007-04-08	11	8	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY	"David A. Dein ""passafist"""	In my attempt to compose some semblance of thoughts about Mel Gibson's new film THE PASSION OF CHRIST.  I must admit I may ruffle some feathers, and create some heated debate.  Let me be the first to say any condemnation I place on myself first.  Nothing I am about to write is an indictment of any faith other than my own personal self.Religion is such bondage.  Whether you like it or not, religion is as flawed and cumbersome as any belief system. This is why I chose at a very young age to be a follower of Christ, because He came and reformed the broken religions, created and instilled a grace I could never deserve.Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is the kind of movie that restores my faith in the cinema.  It is moving, sick, beautiful, sadistic, and probably the most challenging two hours I ever spent in a theater.  It is the most violent, brutal, honest and powerful film I have ever seen.  It the kind of movie I do not ever want to see again and yet probably will see many times, because it is that terrible to watch, but also so compelling.  I left the film changed and for the first time in my life, something that I thought was so close to me became more crystal clear then ever.  For the first time I saw the true power of cinema and true power of God's ultimate grace.  I would offer that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is one of the greatest and most challenging films I have ever seen (sorry Terry Gilliam, but BRAZIL is my number 2 now).As the film opens we see a short verse from the book of Isaiah, (Anyone whose familiar with the Heavy Metal band STRYPER from 80's will remember this verse well):But He was pierced for our transgressions,He was crushed for our iniquities,the punishment that brought us peacewas upon Him,and by His wounds we are healed.-----Isaiah 53:5(NIV)This passage was written hundreds of years before before Jesus Christ was born.  According to the New Testement, this verse was written to tell of the eventual outcome of the coming Messiah.  It is too bad the high priests of Jesus day were so busy trying to hold onto the religious control of their people that they missed the true Messiah standing in front of them.  In their attempt to keep their grasp on the people, they enlisted the help of one of Jesus' friends.  They arrested Jesus Christ and carted him away, placing Him in front of the high priest Caiaphas.  Then they dragged him in front of the Roman magistrate Pontius Pilate.  In a less than valiant effort to save his own skin and politcal power, Pilate pawns this man he believes to be innocent in front of the garish and ineffective figurehead of a king named Herod.  Herod sends Jesus back in front of Pilate who does everything in his power to save this innocent man.  Alas, he gave the Christ over to the crowd to be scourged and ultimately crucified.The rest of the story involves some of the most realistic and brutal scenes ever put on film.  If you thought SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or SCHINDLER'S LIST was hard to sit through, then you cannot fathom how horrible it is watching Christ get scourged, watching metal rip open his skin.  I honestly thought I could take it.  I was wrong.  Any person who thinks mankind is basically good needs to watch how the Roman guards treat Christ.  The funny thing is, I realize how easy it would be for me to place myself in the story.  How easy it would be for me to follow the crowd and how easy it would be for me to treat this man as badly as the Roman guards treated him.What I loved the most about THE PASSION were the tiny moments when the people who were laughing and scorning Jesus soon realized who they were dealing with.  Some looked on with fear like Barabbas or one of the thieves on the cross.  Others looked on with reverence like the Roman centurion who pierced Jesus' side or Simon, a young man who was thrust into the story to help carry the cross. It is the small moments of reality that hit these people that make me glad that sometimes in chaos, people can rise above.I also found myself in the same boat as Peter.  Here is a man who has followed Jesus to the mountaintops.  He promised to stick by his friend forever, yet when the going gets tough, he shows his cowardice by lying and denying his friend.  To be honest, I shed many tears after this scene.  How many times have I done that to save face?  How would I have felt in Peter's situation? How many times have I have sold out my friends for acceptance and to place myself on a higher wrung?Mel Gibson has done the unthinkable.  He has created a film that not only incredibly moving, but also accessible.  It is hard to try to put the life of Jesus into the context of His death because it seems so pointless.  What did this man do to deserve the pain of the cross? Why do people revere Him so much? Why do so many blindly follow? Mostly, why is a man like Christ worth the fuss?  It is simple. We as humans treated God like a piece of junk and yet He forgave us.  This whole episode was necessary to human existence.The final ten minutes of THE PASSION are both moving and damaging all at the same time.  As Jesus dies the screen goes black for what seems like an eternity.  It was not nearly enough time to compose myself, but what follows is a sweetly lyrical approach to the resurrection that does what it needs to.  So many films leave Christ hanging there, in their own way acknowledging that he may have had a bunch of great ideas, but beyond that, who cares?  Without the resurrection, the crucifixion is an innocent man getting the tar beaten out of him for 45 minutes. With the resurrection, the crucifixion is a story of hope and of grace: something I do not deserve.The cast is phenomenal.  Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern hit the right cords when they have to.  Playing these characters is difficult because there is always a tendency to over and/or underplay them.  They also fill in a canvas that borders on realistic and stylized.  I do not think anyone with even any ounce of compassion could not be moved by the pain of watching Morgenstern (who plays Mother Mary) and Bellucci (as Mary Magdelene) wipe up the blood of Christ.I would love to hear what those who disagree with me have to say.  I would love to hear what those whom have no Christian faith think of this film.  Even if you do disagree, do me a favor.  If your mind and soul are in for a challenging and deeply troubling film, give THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST your attention.  Even if you are unfazed, I promise the film is brilliant, and I have only said that about five films in my lifetime.  You may just leave the theater at least a little changed.  You may have a sense of deep despair or tons of joy, but you will leave with just a tad bit more compassion.	5.0	A Masterstroke, A True Masterpiece	2004-05-24	10	8	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"Directors Mel Gibson and Michael Moore (""Fahrenheit 9/11"")stirred controversy in 2004 for their films.  Many loved them, many hated them.  Regardless, their names were undeniable that year.  ""The Passion of the Christ"", Mel Gibson's directorial follow-up to the Oscar-winning ""Braveheart"" (1995), takes Christianity to a new level.  It stars Jim Caviezel (""Pay It Forward"") and Monica Bellucci (""Irreversable"").  This film portrays the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life.  Through the graphic images and the powerful dialect is one of the most unforgettable films of that year and of ever.  This film doesn't play part fiction, part non-fiction; it plays according to to The Bible and other testaments.  This film never holds back on its soul.  Meanwhile, it made film history in many ways.Beyond the controversy is one of the most remarkable films about religion.  Though occassionally some scenes run too slow, and some text is unnecessarily repetitive, its strengths lie upon its ability to tell a story thoroughly.  The emotional aspect never fades from when Jesus is captured to the end.  Through the torture, the blood, the humiliation, and the death, some tears may fall.  Though the conclusion is unquestionable to first-time viewers, the powerful message remains at its peak.  Beyond the last 12 hours of Jesus's life also shares his beliefs and his own faith.  Such written quality was approved by many Christian churches and organizations.  Therefore, this film became the symbol of their religion.The physical aspects of the film are accurate to those from the actual early first century living through the costumes and the sets.  They resemble the pictures from the testaments and history books.  The strong demands for them were met beautifully.  Jesus's physical state during his torture is wonderfully portrayed with make-up.  The blood, the sweat, and bruises add to the powerful standpoint that the film deserves.  Through the work, Jim Caviezel may have been mistaken for the actual Jesus Christ.  Its close graphic images were necessary to include and were wonderfully crafted, proving the level of pain endured.  Such crew-work quality earned this film three Oscar nominations: Best Make-Up, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score.Though all the actors portrayed their characters wonderfully, Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern stand out.  Caviezel's performance as Jesus Christ could not have been done better.  His state of pain in itself, though a few scenes were real, gives new life to this film.  This proved highly difficult since he was in that state of sadness or pain through most of the film.  Morgenstern's portrayal of Mary proved as emotional as Caviezel's.  Though she didn't say much, her facial expressions alone reveal Mary's times, especially witnessing Jesus's torture.Such overall film quality makes ""The Passion of the Christ"" worth watching at least once, Christian or not.  Due to the graphic nature, this is not recommended for children or the faint of heart.  Viewers should use their own discretion.  Few will end this film feeling nothing.  Therefore, this will surely remain commonly talked about to its viewers, even those who dislike it."	4.0	The Most Powerful Film of 2004	2005-03-25	14	8	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"This is a difficult film to rate because of the controversy it engendered and the phenomenon it became.  Generally, with films like this I prefer to wait a while before evaluating them but I will make an exception here.  First off, one has to admire the risk that Mel Gibson took in even making this film.  He could have contented himself making ""Lethal Weapon"" sequels and ""What Women Want"", films that are high concept and high box-office but have no emotional resonance.  To make this film as brutally realistic and in Latin and Aramaic took a lot of courage.  As for the film itself I found it so powerfully compelling that I saw it three times when it was in the theatres.  The depiction of the crucifixion is brutal for a reason; Gibson wants to show us in no uncertain terms that Jesus suffered for our sins because he loves us and the will of the Father was to save humanity.  There is no blame allotted here; we are all guilty for the sins of humanity.  This film had such resonance for me that sermons that I may have heard in church thousands of times took on extra meaning that was not apparent to me before.  As for the acting, Jim Caviezel is more than adequate in portraying the humanity of Jesus.  He does not so much capture Christ's divinity but that may be more the choice of Gibson's than the actor's.  Overlooked in many reviews is the performance of Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother.  Though given little dialogue, her facial expressions say millions of words particualarly in the scenes where she witnesses the suffering of her son.  Another standout performance here is by Hristo Shopov as the indecisive Pilate.  I would also recommend this film to mature young teenagers despite the graphic nature of the violence here.  There is a difference between violence that is instructive and that which is exploitative.  On a final note, I wish they had included more extras on the DVD release, at least a commentary by Gibson.  Gibson included a commentary on the ""Braveheart"" DVD, which I found to be one of the best of it's kind.  My guess is that they will eventually put the extras on a future deluxe edition of this film, which is a shame, because I do not think Gibson entered into this enterprise as a cynical attempt to make money."	5.0	Will Gibson's Version Stand the Test of Time?	2004-09-01	13	11	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful.  For many, myself included, the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity.  The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify, and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith.  Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible, gritty reality.  This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment, not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.  I am not a Christian, but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film.  This is not a film to ""enjoy,"" but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind."	5.0	Powerful	2005-07-04	8	4	4

This movie really drove another point home for me as well:  Our lives are not our own.  The worst phrase I've ever heard in my life is ""my body, my choice"".  We do not belong to ourselves.  We are indebted to God, and to everyone, such as parents, teachers, uncles, aunts, grandparents, friends, and country, anyone who have ever given us any amount of their precious time.  We are responsible for honoring God, family and those people fore mentioned with our lives.This movie really made God more real for me.  I believe that was Mel Gibson's intention and why it's done so well.  I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to understand why Christians love Jesus so much.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2JJ7OG62X6TUF	David Haggith	"Nearly every film that has dealt with the crucifixion of Jesus has sanitized the scenes.  Now a director has come along who has a track record of taking pain to its extreme limit, as when Wallace in Braveheart is drawn and quartered -- but only AFTER having been beaten and slashed and stabbed far beyond the limits of what the human body could really take.So, it is with The Passion of Christ where Jesus is whipped incessantly for about fifteen minutes on film, first with sticks and then with a cat of nine tails. His body is so deeply and completely lacerated that it would have bled dry long before he reached the top of Golgatha where he was crucified. Then he gets flogged for another half hour on film all the way to the top of Golgatha while packing his 190-pound cross. Sure, he's the Son of God; but he's supposed to have a human body, and no human would survive even half that much whipping with metal shards.But that's still not enough. The nails are not simply nails, but nine-inch spikes so that the pounding can take longer and so they come through the cross on the other end. That gives the Romans reason to brutally flip the huge cross over, dumping Jesus on his face in the rocks, so they can stand on the cross and sledge hammer the back of the cross while Jesus's face is in the rocks -- just to bend over the protruding nail tips. (As if such long spikes through such hard wood could ever have come out under the weight of a human body and as if the Romans were concerned about being neat with nail points and as if they didn't have to think about getting the nails back out again to take Jesus off the cross.)So, those who have said below that Gibson seems intent, almost sadistic, in rubbing his audience's nose in the blood of Jesus are not wrong.  About half of the violence is gratuitous in that it exceeds any plausible reality by about that much.The parts of the film that were moving for me were not the HOURS of brutality.  I shed no tears there because I naturally start to distance myself from it when it's so far beyond plausibility. It's like watching Freddy Krueger come back up after he's been shot and stabbed twenty times.  The movie starts to feel voyueristic.  Where I did have tears was during the gentle moments when Mary Magdalene remembers Jesus saving her from being stoned and when his mother sees him fall under the cross and recalls a scene where Jesus fell as a little boy, and she ran to the little boy to lift him up.  And now he is being lifted up in a much different way.  There is also a problem with the passion of Christ (small ""p"") lacking meaning when it has so little context. In the Gospels, the passion scenes are the climax of works that focused primarily on his life.Nevertheless, this is a great film in many respects.  The artistry of the film is superb, and the acting completely believable.  As for it being anti-semitic, it was accurate to the only history we have.  The Romans come off looking brutal and sadistic in the extreme, the Jewish leadership, as wanting Jesus dead, and the Jewish citizenry as divided between those whose hearts go out to him in small acts of kindness and those who spit on him and cry out for his crucifixion.  People today who complain of anti-semiticism in this film just want to rewrite the history they don't like -- sort of like those people who try to claim the holocaust never happened because they don't want to feel guilty of Jewish deaths."	4.0	The Pendulum Swings the Other Way	2004-02-26	2	1	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A103KNDW8GN92L	David Hugaert	"Elicited by a controversial response amongst church leaders for weeks leading up to its' universal release, Mel Gibson's master epic ""The Passion of the Christ"" is definitely certain to garner huge receipt sales at the box office, as well as likely receive much worldwide acclaim (and applause) amongst moviegoers. However, ""TPotC"" is NOT ""The Bible The Movie"", and shouldn't be interpreted according to any particular religious belief or doctrine. This is the main reason why such religious portrayals are viewed as highly controversial accounts, and much becomes muddled or lost when the plot or storyline is overanalyzed as a result. When ""TPotC"" isn't seen or viewed as an accurate account of biblical events, and is seen as a grand display of theatrics involving visually stunning physical scenarios not disguised as works of art, is when it results as a picture worth viewing many times over. And ""TPotC"" contains an exponential degree of props (of both the physical and intellectual variety - which are prime factors contributing to the outcome of this fine, upstanding work of art). In conclusion, one must leave their theological preferences (as well as religious prejudices) at the door, in order for ""TPotC"" to have any real merit of entertainment value (of which there is a high degree). Be warned, as this epic contains graphic images of violence. Language buffs will enjoy the eloquently spoken Hebrew dialects (including the English subtitles). Please, by all means, view this picture with an open mind, and above all, listen without prejudice (and ignore those blasted critics!)!"	4.0	"""...Passion..."" meets Controversy"	2004-03-09	10	3	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A35AMXTYXUH9BT	"David James Trapp ""author of Dog Days in Bedl..."	The Passion of the Christ leaves viewers speechless.  On one level, it is a brutal, bloody movie, but this is necessary.  A form of art must be graphic at times to reflect a larger truth.  Execution by flogging and crucifixion was a grisly form of death.  The Romans used it to torture and humiliate the accused.  Yet the underlying thesis, that Christ voluntarily died this death as a loving sacrifice for our sins, comes through.  This is an important, brilliantly made film.  You will be deeply moved by it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A11L5M4MJP00UW	"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover"""	"This is one of the most bloody, graphic films I have ever seen.  The torture goes on and on and on.  It's really over the top.  They should rename it ""Torture of the Christ"".  I couldn't see the point of the film.  Yes, Christ suffered a terrible price for our sins.  Crucifixion alone is a very horrible, painful death, but why keep showing scene after scene of beating and whipping and torn and bloody flesh?  Just too much.  What's the point?  The horrible suffering could have been made apparent without so much gore and so much time devoted to it.  I am dumbfounded that people found this movie powerful and moving and that it got such high praise.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Not much entertainment value and no real religious value that I can see.  Just a torture movie dressed up with religious themes.  Sorry, it didn't do a thing for me.  The only redeeming thing about this movie was that the period costumes were very impressive.  The question is, were they accurate?  The story seems to be mostly accurate, following the biblical account, as near as I could tell.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  There are many much better inspirational movies.  Don't let kids see this movie; it will be very disturbing to them.  Don't bother to see it yourself either.  If you are a Christian, there are much better ways to spend your time.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3TCTFGX48CYWB	David O'Brien	I've a lot of respect for Mel Gibson both for his staunch religious beliefs and his skill as a director.I thought Braveheart was a very well directed film.I was pleased when I learned that Jim Caviezel was being cast as Jesus in 'The Passion Of The Christ' and I was also very happy when I noticed that he had brown contact lenses in his eyes for the part.I could never understand the western-ised attempts in previous religious films to give Jesus blue eyes and pale skin.Jesus was a Jew from Nazareth so it was almost certain that he had dark skin and dark eyes.Anyway, I considered the film to be tough going because of all of the violence but it was a respectful and solemn piece and made you feel a sense of revulsion at the cruelty that was endured by Jesus and also a feeling that HE died for our sins which gives one a feeling of hope also.Caviezel gave an honest,decent performance and he really looked as if he was suffering as the passion took place.Overall, a good film but for a few criticisms.The whipping scene went on for too long.I know that we had to see the full extent of the cruelty suffered by Our Lord but I really think that the scene entered the realm of snuff , it was that excessive.Another thing I didn't like was the scant attention to showing the Resurrection - surely an integral part of the whole crucifiction.I didn't like the way the film portrayed His Resurrrection from the tomb.I thought it was sloppily doneFinally , the only other piece that I found distasteful was the crucificion when the thief beside Jesus had his eyes pecked out by the crow.I thought that was totally unnecessary also.Overall, it was a well-made film with a few minor flaws.I would watch it again however just to try and reinforce a few beliefs.	4.0	A graphic and respectful depiction of Christ's suffering	2004-07-14	3	2	1

The theater was completely full. I am a definite movie buff, but I've never experienced anything like I experienced yesterday.When the movie ended and people began leaving, no one talked. Talking would have been irreverent after such a biblical presentation of truth. As I think back over the film, tears still well in my eyes. My heart aches. I am in awe, but not of any Hollywood person or production. I am in awe at what my Lord did for me, for each one of us.Smaller children most likely would have a hard time with ""The Passion,"" because it is extremely violent, just as Roman flogging, scourging, and crucifixion were extremely violent. It isn't a ""nice"" experience, but it is a heart-breaking, life-changing experience.If memory serves me correctly, these words appeared on the opening screen:""But because of our sins he was wounded,beaten because of the evil we did.We are healed by the punishment he suffered,made whole by the blows he received"" (Isaiah 53:5 GNB).If you want a ""feel good"" film, stay at home.

Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass, Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome, disgusting, gratuitous gorefest.  Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't), but even in that case, I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic.	1.0	Uggh!	2006-11-06	47	18	29

It is an emotionally draining movie to see but well worth the torment.  Each person has a thresh-hold for what they can endure but Mel was kind enough to give us little escapisms from the violence with the use of back-flashes and camera pans on the characters faces, watching them go thru their own emotional journey.  Jim Caviezel performance is academy worthy, he portrays Jesus not as a frail, weak, unrealistic supernatural being but as a physically and spirtually strong human being with a larger purpose.  This movie was beautifully cast, there was not one character out of place.  Mel's vision was dead on track with the gospels and took only very little artistic license to get a characters humanity or evilness across.

The reviews and press were almost wholly concerned with other issues - Mel's father's beliefs, potentially anti-semitic lines, the violence, etc - but I did not see a single review addressing the quality of The Passion as a work of cinema. So I waited until the DVD came out.This is the most striking and original film from any nation since the 1970s.  In many ways, this film makes me think of the classic American films of that decade, where directors had control and turned movies into works of art.  The Passion is entirely free of any kind of studio cliche or formula.  The visuals are stunning.  Mel's independence has yielded a masterpiece.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A141VQ6PS6ZABJ	Dean M. Wheatley	This is, without a doubt, the goriest glorification of on screen violence that I have ever seen. It disgusts me that the characters live up to typical stereotypes of Jews and Romans of that era. As a standalone movie, it would be unlikely to hold even a diehard movie buffs interest for more than 30 minutes. The story presents the main character, Jesus as nothing more than a punching bag for stereotypical, sniggering, Roman soldiers. Whilst this may or may not have been the case, we hear very little about the teachings of Jesus or why Jewish orthodoxy found him so much of a threat that they needed to strong arm the Romans into killing him.The acting is pretty good, the mood setting is excellent, and the decision to keep it in its native tongue really makes it impossible not to be moved in some fashion by this movie. However, the storyline is week and the characters are pretty shallow. This movie is shocking for all the wrong reasons. I found myself completely unable to relate to a Jesus that seems, at times, to actually want another beating. I'm sure I wasn't alone in wishing that he'd just stay down!Christianity has a lot of good messages to share. I find it disheartening that the only way Mel felt as though he could spread the word is through shock tactics.  We're subjected to horrific scene after scene of Jesus beatings. At one point in the movie, we're subjected to a 15-20 minute scene of a public beating, complete with flying fleshy bits and laughing Roman soldiers, resulting in a pool of blood that wouldn't be out of place in a horror movie. If you like gore, you'll love this movie. Taken at face value, The Passion is an mediocre film at best. As a literal interpretation of the last days of Jesus (as seen through the eyes of the New Testament) it does an OK job of telling the story. Make of it what you will, but this movie will be massively successful in spite of its many failings. I hope you enjoy this movie because I certainly didn't.	2.0	Beating Jesus	2004-04-17	28	8	20

Statements such as ""pornographic"", ""anti-sematic"" and ""proof that God hates us"" are words of people who have not actually seen the film.  First of all, there was NO SEX in this movie, so I have no idea why someone would call it ""pornographic.""Secondly, to those who view the movie as anti-sematic, Christ IS Jewish, His parents were Jewish, and His apostles were Jewish.  He was raised in the culture of the Jewish people, read the Torah and taught, as well as was taught in the temple.  While there were Jews that thought he wasn't the Messiah, there were those who did (some were part of the Sanhedrin, others were His apostles, some were His disciples, even one of the theives who was crucified at the same time recognized Him as the Messiah).  And to those Christians who have the audacity to blame Christ's death on the Jews: SHAME ON YOU!!  Read your Bible!  God sent Christ to die for ALL to show how much He loves us.  That was the plan from the very beginning (prior to New Testament)!  That was the whole reason Christ was born!  Read the Old Testament!  First and foremost, Christ (God) was born for this purpose.  God wanted to show all humanity just how much He loves us and this is how He chose to do it.  He had to put His love into terms that we humans could understand.  How many times have you told your child, lover, spouse or best friend (in so many words), ""I love you so much, I would die for you?""  How many times have we seen in movies where someone else takes a bullet for another character that he/she cares about?  Dying to protect someone you love or care for deeply is something that all humanity regards as the greatest sacrifice one can make and is considered a very noble deed (do we not give special honor to soliders who die fighting for their country?).  God sent Jesus (God) to not just die some quick-n-easy death for us, but He sent Him to die a horrific,  violent and time-consuming death as proof of His eternal love.  This film shows us just how much God loves us.  It shows us in graphic detail the violent torture and death Christ endured for EACH AND EVERYONE OF US: Jews and Gentiles alike.  The Jews are NOT ""Christ-Killers.""  This was God's plan from the beginning.  ANY Christian who says otherwise doesn't read their Bible (or they would know better)!  God's love for us is inmeasureable and that is what the Passion of Christ is showing us: Just to what lengths God would go for each and every one of us.  Consequently, this is a VERY powerful and moving film."	5.0	No Porn or Hate here!	2004-06-12	4	3	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3TJEFNGXTIIUA	Deborah	"I saw the Passion on opening weekend but had overdosed on researching reviews and ""behind the scenes"" commentaries. The first viewing I had to sit too close, was distracted by the audience and wasn't as affected by the movie experience as I had anticipated. Let me say I rarely enjoy repeated viewing of a film. However, I have now seen the Passion film 3 times and with each viewing I am amazed at nuances in dialog and expression I missed earlier. To fully appreciate the screenplay, symbolism, directing and set design one should do a chronological study/read of the 4 gospels in the New Testament prior to the movie. It will reveal the depth of the entire work of the Passion to you.Oh, and forget the idea of antisemitism....every human that has lived on earth, both BC and AD has been fully culpable for the crucifixion in 33AD as well as daily, now. As implied in the film, His free gift of Compassionate, Merciful Grace is all we can trust by His death/life through the Resurrection depicted in the representative scene. I was a tad disappointed in the brievity of that scene symbolic of His overcoming states of matter and movement between our physical world and the spirit world.This year's Gospel of John is another excellent and similar film but without the in depth of brutality shown in The Passion.

It is one of the most important films of our time, and will open dialog in families and churches and among people everywhere.The way the movie was presented, from the garden of Gethsemene to the end, it was like I was a witness to what was happening in front of me. Yes, it was violent, but not from beginning to end, as some critics suggest. It was hard to watch at times, but the violence was not gratuitous. The story pulled me in and kept me there, and by the time it was over, I couldn't speak.Mel Gibson did an incredible job with this movie. I think it looks more like a $100 million film instead of $25 million, as far as the costumes, settings, and the use of Aramic and Latin languages.

I saw it in theaters. Like many of us, I cried. But as time went by...the world started noticing something...Mel Gibson is a nut. He isnt you say? Oh, well then i guess its ok to pass out drunkn and naked on your bed and have your son come find you...and then after that...release another version of, the passion.THAT LAST LINE SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING RIGHT THERE PEOPLE. Mel said in the beginning he made this movie to witness to people. The only reason anyone releases another version of the same movie, is for money, NOTHING ELSE. So maybe it has better behind the scenes, interviews, maybe a uncut version im not sure, but i will tell you this, Are you buying it for what his movie stands for? (Jesus) or because of a bonus disc? The media is nothingbut a trap, you fall in it, and then realize, your caught and can't get out. The Passion was supposed to be a touching movie. Now, its just another piece of entertanment that is getting more money from people that dont understand.Now, im not going to get religious on you, but what do you thnk Jesus thinks of this? seriouslly, think about it...think hard. Now if your gonna say, ""Jesus is happy about it because more people will come to him now"". NO, you couldnt be anymore wrong. Jesus is probably very upset. Know why? cuz re'releasing this movie, is doing nothing but making money of Jesus dying. Mel doesn't care about how it may effect people spiritually, he is just doing what people do in that bussiness, and if you know any better, you will realize it, and steer away from this. I can already tell you, alot of people will read this and hate it, but deep down...you know what's right, are gonna support a guy thats just wants to basiclly steal from you? or will you just read your Bible, and know everything you need to know without wasting $20 bucks?"	1.0	Come on people don't fall into the trap!!!	2007-02-06	92	9	83
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3J0YRN2NWNR6Z	Decaire, Teasha	Why is the  story of Jesus such a controversial topic? The story of his life, death, and resurrection is not only biblical fact, but is also said to be proven as more historically accurate every day. Passion of the Christ is  a film worth watching no matter who you are or what you believe, because no matter what you believe it's an interesting story, this film is visually stunning, and by watching you, yourself become educated. Although these agreements may be strong, is it enough to get an atheist to view the film.The story of Jesus Christ is a very interesting story no matter if you believe it's true or not. Jesus was said to be a man who was born of a virgin named Mary. God sent  Jesus in human form to earth to take away the sin of the world, and this was accomplished by being brutally beaten then nailed to the cross, to die. The depth of this story is so intriguing and amazing, how could one not be interested in seeing what this Jesus guy did for the world.Passion of the Christ is a very unique film. The story of Jesus' death is very violent and graphic and to be able to capture a very small degree of that pain and struggle and put it in a form of entertainment for people, makes it very surreal. The gore in this movie is incredible, the effects look so real and painful that it makes you feel like you are sitting there watching in person as it happened. Being able to capture such life like graphics in a film about a proven existence of a man, is just another reason to watch this movie.Educating yourself is very important especially on such a controversial topic. This allows you the upper hand when it comes to a debate about that topic. Watching the Passion of the Christ, is feeding yourself information on how other people tend to see these types of events. By taking apart of this you can make your argument stronger regardless the side you are on. So What if you  have no desire to watch it? Then do so because this story tends to come up when speaking of world history, and the things this world has faced in a short time.The story of Jesus Christ is a very controversial topic, because of a persons own beliefs. By taking the time to watch Passion of the Christ, you are seeing a very interesting story, seeing unbelievable special effects, and educating yourself on a topic that you may or may not know very much about, Passion of the Christ is a film worth watching for those reasons, so no matter who you are or what you believe why not become familiar with the story of Jesus and see his life and death in a film for a short while out of your busy day.	5.0	Teasha Decaire- Passion of the Christ	2004-12-10	12	7	5

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1POGYGC5C99W5	Deeyar	The Passion of the Christ is powerfully moving and fanatically obtuse in equal doses. The typical star rating doesn't apply, because scenes range from classic to poor and all stops in between. But name another Hollywood icon who would spend $30 million out of his own pocket to bring his personal obsession with Christ's agony to the screen and film it in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitles. Jim Caviezel, who plays Jesus, doesn't so much give a performance as offer himself up as raw meat. So graphic are the torture scenes -- flayings, a crown of thorns, whips with barbed metal tips, nails driven into hands and feet -- that the film seems like the greatest story ever told by the Marquis de Sade. Gibson introduces horror elements, such as an androgynous Satan with Gollum-like spawn. And tricked-up sequences -- a tear from God the Father that falls from heaven like the bomb from Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor -- cheapen the film's purpose: to show the enormity of Christ's suffering. More questionable is the caricature of the Jewish high priest Caiaphas (Mattia Sbragia) and the sympathetic take on the Roman governor Pilate (Hristo Shopov). But Gibson's immersion in the blood of Christ is an act of faith filmed with a zealot's rapture. It's a shame he has no faith in audiences to feel Jesus' pain without rubbing their noses in it. By filming New Testament Gospels with Old Testament fire and brimstone, his Passion emerges as something contrary to Jesus's spirit: unforgiving.	3.0	Powerful - But not the masterpiece everyone claiming it is	2005-03-18	7	0	7

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3VLX5Z090RQ0V	"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut"""	"Wow!  I was speechless when I watched this film.  People are making such a big deal out of this:  the content, all the controversy from the news and people's gossip, Mel Gibson's direction.  I hardly heard about this film until just a few weeks, so I felt like watching this film, cause it looked really interseting to see and know what's the hype about it. I have to say, this movie really is...""interesting.""The Passion of the Christ isn't really about the life of Jesus Christ, but just the outcome of him.  It took place in the last 12 hours of Jesus's life in Jerusalem.  One of his desciples, Judas, betrayed Jesus, played by James Caviezel, and was captured by a strong religious group known as Pharisees at the Garden of Olives.  After being accused as a blasphemer to many, Jesus was then chastised to painful whippings, all then leading to the unforgettable, the crucifixion.  During it all, Jesus tries to ""not lead him to temptation, but to deliver him from evil"", ala, Satan.  Also during his torturing, there are some arbitrary-yet-significant back stories that further displays the life of Jesus: being as a carpenter, delivering the message of God to his people, and delivering the last supper of his disciples.  Again, Wow!  Mel Gibson should've renamed this title, The Torture of the Christ, but people say to me that the word ""Passion"" meant ""Suffering"" at a certain degree.  Let me comprehend this: Jesus has gotten spit at, beaten up, whipped, shredded, piercied, and any painful way he went through that not ever the most durable of S&M; freaks can endure...so all that suffering was passion?  Thank You, Mel Gibson, now I don't want any kind of pleasure after this.Wow!  Critics say this movie is graphic, but I didn't expect this movie would be THAT graphic!  The blood, the abuse and torture...excuse me, the ""passion"" that happen to the Son of God for whole 126 minutes, not even all of Nine Inch Nails' uncut music videos I've seen would hold a candle to this movie.  I believe Gibson knew what he was getting into, and that's how he wanted it, so I applaud for him directing this film.  He focused all his past works as an anti-heroic actor, and tries to use it to display the hardship and sorrow of this film, and it made this film work.  The well-done direction gives new perspection on the Son of God.  I see Jesus bleeding, scarred, scabbed, and ostracized, heck, even the Pharisees rather free a murderer than a blasphemer like him, but he knew the future bleeks him, and he would still deliver the words from God to the people.  Even when people around him wanted to see him executed, he loved and forgiving those who has yet to understand God's words.  He would even put his soul in vain to repent for the sins the people created.  It made me realize that it's not the Jews that are responsible for the death of Jesus, but mankind is responsible.  We take our lives for granted, and he sold his life for us knowing that, and I felt like I could've done better with my own life since Jesus risked his ""passionate"" life for people like me to have a better one.The Passion of the Christ has one of the best cinematographies around.  The ways it showed Jesus's suffering in slow-motion, giving it a more dramatic feel, and how the characters expressed about this whole entity.  It's hard to explain in detail about the cinematography of this film, but to put it short, it made the experience felt more real.  For authenticity's sake, the characters speak only in Aramaic language, so whether people like or not, this movie's in subtitles.  If there is one serious flaw this movie has, I think that it just wasn't completely realized.  I may not have read the Holy Bible, but there's gotta be more than just Jesus experience the outcome.  It was suppose to send a message to his people after he died and adore him for his sacrifice, and yet after he died, his soul just walked towards heaven and the movie's over.  That's that, the message that was suppose to deliver in this movie was nonexistant, and it made me suffer, not only emotionally, but somewhat intellectually.This movie really creep me out, but at the same time, I was really involved with it, and I couldn't believe that I was so involved with a biblical film.  The Passion of the Christ isn't everyone's cup of red wine with a side of crackers.  People who're religiously-involved, wanting to know more about Jesus, or just weak-hearted by its graphic content might not enjoy this movie so much.  It doesn't made me change my mind about reading the holy bible as an interest, but it was the best depicition on Jesus's life I've seen since those lousy TV specials.  It may have been controversial to some degree, but people should watch this movie because it's just subliminally engaging."	4.0	Passion = Suffering?	2004-02-25	0	0	0

You knew what this film was about before viewing it, yet you criticized it for showing what it was 'Supposed' to show:  ""The last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ"".Suffice it to say; this was probably tame compared to the actual event.Definitely a film every Christian should own."	5.0	The GREATEST  LOVE  STORY  EVER  SEEN  ON  FILM!	2006-07-09	26	11	15

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A747MM5FP3P0Q	Dennis Jensen	"The most bizarre feature of the controversies surrounding The Passion of the Christ is the accusation of anti-Semitism. Jesus' persecution and execution was entirely an intra-Jewish issue, until the Jewish leaders had to take it to the Roman officials. This was a Jewish man with Jewish followers and he was tried by a Jewish court. If this is anti-Semitic, then the story of Moses being nearly stoned by angry Israelites (Numbers 14:10) is also anti-Semitic. How absurd! Was Jeremiah anti-Semitic for denouncing Jewish kings, leaders, priests, prophets, scribes, and common people for their sins? Or is the Hebrew scripture anti-Semitic for recording how the Jewish kings, leaders, and people persecuted and sometimes killed the prophets and the righteous? Yet when the New Testament records Jewish persecution of Jesus and his Jewish followers, that's anti-Semitic?! Suppose one of the Hebrew kings, before killing a prophet, were to have said, ""Let his blood be upon us and our children."" No one would have given the statement a second thought and, definitely, no one would assume this curse actually applied to all of Israel. He didn't even have the right to apply it to his own children because the Hebrew scripture teaches that each person must bear his or her own guilt (Jeremiah 31:29-30).I think my words will be wasted because people will see only what they want to see. When anti-Christian paranoia reaches this peak of absurdity, reason is powerless to be heard.Gibson's masterpiece is the surely the greatest depiction of Jesus' death ever to be produced on film. Jesus was killed by both Jews and Gentiles. We're all guilty of his death and need the reconciliation with God only that death can bring."	5.0	The myth of anti-Semitism in The Passion	2011-04-05	8	5	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A32QSVCT23WCZQ	Deonna Pinson	I expected it to be more graphic than it was, truthfully.  However, having seen other spawn of Hollywood, I was surprised at the fit that everyone else has thrown.That said, the visual imagery of this movie is nothing short of stunning, and it keeps in tune with the Bible more than I expected.  To those who were perturbed that Jesus' teeth were good:  People of that time did not have the shoddy, sugary diets that we indulge in.  Therefore, their teeth actually stayed in better condition for longer.  A scientist wrote a piece on this following the movie.  I would quote the source, but I'm sure it can be found somewhere on the internet.Also, it pleased me greatly to see Jesus and Mary having a typical mother-son playful moment during a flashback sequence.  How refreshing!  After all, this WAS his mother.  I'm sure that they did have a nice relationship with each other, which is something one tends to forget when thinking about the Son of God.I am not saying that viewing The Passion will change your life or your way of thinking.  It may not.  However, it will make you think.  In fact, following the ending, I did not feel a sense of the movie being over so much as I wanted to just go somewhere quiet and think about what I had seen in great depth.  Give yourself the opportunity to enjoy some of the most brilliant cinematography you'll ever come across as well as a film that is guaranteed to make you think.	5.0	Violent?

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AGP9IA5IIG3VW	DerWeg	"I have no idea whether the filmmaker is a prejudiced zealot, as opinions to that effect abound. But in the actual movie (a film about the voluntary sacrifice of Christ) I found nothing of that sort. Beyond all lesser contexts of tribe, kin or creed, the story contained in PASSION is the far more universal Eternal Drama, that of MAN destroying the best thing that is his, namely the possibility of opening his eyes and seeing change, seeing a way in life to be less violent. We crucify the Truth now today as we always have; with metaphorical stones we continually ""kill"" and suppress people and ideas.Why, in the Drama of Christ did Judas even need to 'betray' Jesus before they crucified him? The authorities could have found Jesus without much trouble, so Judas' action makes no sense except for its symbolic meaning. That meaning is: Christ (through Judas) handed himself over to the baser men who could not see what he was, and (if you review the last supper) Jesus essentially commanded Judas to help him. That is missing in Gibson's presentation, although the spiritual suffering Judas must have willingly undertook to play his role is itself portrayed as a horror for any man to endure. But for what purpose, what result? The crucifixion was necessary, fully intended... and at the moment Christ says ""it is done"" before slouching down on the cross, we realize something has been done TO the men who brought him there, ie. some deep frightening realization of themselves has been touched. This moment is for all of us, and the effect of the event has not gone away.A very thoughtful film overall. We are made to experience the viscerality of Christ's especially fervent subjection to suffering (and why such fervor?) not just through gory makeup and effects, but equally through the depths of psychic pain we see in the faces of Mary his mother, and his devoted Magdelen. I was never so utterly moved contemplating the event of Christ's death. And never so surprised and elated by the event to follow!Just see it. It is hard to talk about this film apart from it's meaning in Christ's teaching and life, things themselves very layered in meaning. The film (and our reactions to it) evokes in me many thoughts, like this one:Can zealotry and critical thinking exist in the same mind? And which thinking did Christ call us to use in the world?"	5.0	Intense, textured, not heavy-handed.	2005-01-28	10	7	3

FURLANO	After seeing The Passion, I now know why all the Christophobes have been trying to demonize Mel Gibson over this movie:  it's extremely powerful, and has the power to spark a religious revival in this country.  This movie is a gut-wrenching, factual depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life (let's not be idiotic and start splitting hairs about whether Jesus was spiked through the wrists, and not the hands, etc.)  The acting, directing, and photography is superb.  The dialog in Aramaic and Latin, with English subtitles is very effective.After seeing the torture and death that Christ endured for our sins, it's doubtful that many Christians will not consider viewing this movie to be a life-altering event.  All the hysteria about this movie being anti-Jewish is complete garbage, most of which is foisted upon us by people who either haven't even seen the film or have other motives for trying to block the film.Mel Gibson is a hero in the truest sense of the word, and should be loudly commended for bringing this momentous world event to the big screen.	5.0	ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE	2004-02-25	1	1	0

Bevis and Butthead probably would have thought it was ""awesome"" though.Then there is the bad guy from the hot place downstairs who lurks and hangs out. Mel throws in some 'special' effects to make sure you 'get' that the bad guy from the hot place downstairs is... well... bad.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2WR7QGN2CQ655	"D. Garmany ""dgarmany"""	Very little of the first few pages of reviews here have actually dealt with the movie. Most of the discussion has involved debate regarding the personal decision of being a Christian.  I stopped reading well-short of the 1600+ reviews so far.Personally, I thought the movie was excellent as a portrayal of one interpretation of what MIGHT have actually happened. The truth is that NOBODY knows for certain EXACTLY what happened - obviously there are no eyewitnesses still remaining.Another truth - the right to be a Christian (or to pursue the religion of one's choice, for that matter) is a personal decision based on faith.  Those of us who are Christians prefer to believe the texts of both the Old and New Testaments and prefer to believe there are more reasons in this world to believe in God than not to.  We CHOOSE to see things EVERYDAY that remind us why we believe in God and why we will continue to believe in God.  Simply stated, we believe in Jesus because we believe the New Testament is inspired by God, therefore Jesus is God's son. The Holy Trinity is a difficult concept to understand (certainly longer of an explanation than I can type here), but having faith is enough - it is NOT written (anywhere) that we are to fully understand EVERYTHING. God's people are to have faith, and for that they will be rewarded.I would like to remind several reviewers that your words here do not in ANY way hurt the Christians on this website. You only hurt yourselves, your reputations, and your credibility with such negative comments. As several others have stated, The United States of America is a country where we are FORTUNATE to have freedom of religion, and we MUST be tolerant of others' rights to pursue Christianity, religions otherwise, or not. The basis for Christianity is faith; the basis of the USA, anymore, is toleration and diversity - founded on belief in God, whether you like it or not.It would seem that many reviewers need to practice better toleration, at the very least. Hopefully some of you will change your minds and seek God at some point in your life - it sounds like you need Him.In conclusion, and to the best of my knowledge, modern science has never been able to disprove ANYTHING within the entire text of the Bible. I believe I'll keep my faith in God while I wait for science to explain it to me.  (And yes, I am a scientist with a graduate degree).God bless and forgive us.	5.0	Sad Discussion	2005-03-10	15	11	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A31YOTVWTL1AL4	"D. Griffie ""god follower"""	"I am currently awaiting this motion picture's release on DVD.  I have reservations on movies being made about the Lord Jesus Christ.  All the ""Jesus"" movies ever made have been sanitized I believe, with clean, groomed and very much unlooking of people who lived in those lands.  Plus, these movies have been ""cheesy"" as well.  I can think of no better word.  Also, how can men begin to capture the glory of Christ, the magnitude of His work (dying so that sinful man can be reconciled to God) and the weight and splendor of His resurrection in a movie?  Mel Gibson has certainly broken free of the old Bible epics on film, and I believe finally made a movie that comes close to capturing the power (and humanity, Jesus was both God and man) of Christ.I will address the movie both theologically (as a Christian) and cinematically (as a movie lover).  Theologically, Gibson has pulled no punches.  He hasn't crafted a ""world friendly"" movie.  That is, as a Christian, Gibson isn't shaking hands with the world in compromise.  He believes it when Christ said, ""I am the way, the truth and the life."" (John 14:6)  While Gibson did include some extra-Biblical things such as Satan's presence in the garden, the ""demon children"" (watch the movie) and Jesus' playfully hanging out with His mother for example, I still wasn't troubled.  Gibson remained faithful to the four Gospels.  True, you must know your Bible and the Gospels to follow this film.  For anyone who is a Christian, he or she should have no trouble knowing what is going on at a given time.  If you watch this movie and are totally confused, I hope you would take up a Bible and read.Cinematically, this movie is nearly a masterpiece.  It was shot near perfection.  The use of color, close-ups and slow motion shots are amazing.  Jim Caviezel does an incredible job, as does all the cast.  The score to the movie is haunting.  From the opening haunting scene in the garden where Christ is in anguish, Gibson had me.  As a fellow Christian, I thought, ""Finally someone has come close to getting it right.""The accusations of this movie being anti-Sematic are unfounded.  Many critics have said Gibson rubs are noses in the gore and violence of this film.  The passion of Christ had to have been gory folks, and I grant you, crucifixion was violent and bloody.  Make no mistake, the film is violent beyond compare, but Gibson has captured what it must had been like.  This film is for the mature viewer, certainly.  I can't question all of Gibson's motives.  I pray he sincerely has done this as evangelism, to show the enormity of Christ sacrifice for us who will come to Him.Whether you embrace the Christian message of redemption or not, there is no denying the fact this is a powerful movie."	5.0	A Non-Sanitized Biblical Account Put to Film	2004-08-16	20	18	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2020S9MJETST6	"DGriswell ""gfp2003"""	Mel Gibson offers forth a movie of epic proportions! One whose tale of Jesus' last hours includes what others do not. If you have seen Ben-Hur, or The Miracle Maker, you have no doubt seen an interpretation of Jesus' last hours leading up to his crucifixion. What this movie adds is something that was not present in other movies: The emotional bond between Him and Mary, his mother. It also presents Jesus' torment for what it really was, not some watered-down, censored, tame version of what someone thought people could stomach. The fact is, Jesus WAS tortured, his body WAS ripped to shreds, and he still stood tall for His Father's Will. If you cannot stomach seeing someone tortured like an animal while his blood spills all over the ground around Him, you need to see this movie even more than those who CAN take it. Only by seeing what Jesus went through in his last few tortuous hours can you really begin to appreciate the sacrifice He made for us. Go see the movie, then go home and reflect.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3MCC5MAJYJYMD	Dhaval Vyas	'The Passion of the Christ' was one of the most controversial, famous, talked about films of the year 2004.  It was the cause for a lot of stir even before it was released.  Most people fail to realize all of that doesn't matter because Jesus Christ never existed!!  Jesus Christ is a mythological figure the church has exploited for hundreds of years and now the filmmaking industry has for almost a hundred years.  There is absolutely no archeological or historical evidence that Jesus Christ existed.  Even if he did exist, it would be highly unlikely he would have received that kind of punishment.It is a shame a con artist like Mel Gibson is using this mythological character to make millions of dollars.  People have to start swaying away from the manipulations of the church and the filmmaking industry and start looking at the hard facts.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AOWSVGYK0WWCG	D	"This movie was mostly visual-with a lot of background music reminiscent of ""The Last Temptation of Christ""-which, in my opinion, surpasses this film in many ways. The dialogue, which was in another language-did not intensify this film-especially because the subtitles were practically non-existent. The story in the film was presented based on writings of a German nun who inspired Hitler,  and the book, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. So I cannot by any means see this film as ""exactly the way it happened"", as some are so eager to believe. People are so naive and searching for truth that they will take just about anything at face value.The Passion was a bloodbath-but that is not the reason why I did not care for this film. The whole point of this film was to illustrate how much Jesus suffered for those who sinned. Jesus had no idea that a religion would be created as a result of his death-and that his image would be sold at Malls across the country, and churches built in his name. I love the story of Jesus, and am intrigued by how he died. However, that does not make me desire to place him on a higher level than myself, or anyone else. I am not a Christian, nor am I religious-because I think it makes people lack their own identity. Jesus was a simple man who taught kindness and truth. People should try and be more Jesus-like, rather than placing him on a pedestal and calling him their savior. There have been so many wonderful men and women to live and die-some of which were as awesome as Jesus. The only difference is that a whole branch of Judaism (Christianity) was created because of this man. Jesus believed in God-wouldn't it just make sense to believe what Jesus believed instead of twisting his teachings around and turning him into God? If anyone is sinning-it is The Christians-who are going against Jesus's philosophy.  I think that this movie is garbage that glorifies Christ-making him look like an ego-maniac rather than a messiah. I did not like the acting-and thought Jesus was portrayed as pompous. I thought Mel Gibson portrayed Jesus as he sees himself. I took this film and placed it in the same category as other films based on true events-but not a true story. I too, lost respect for Mel Gibson. I gave it 2 stars for inspiring me to think about how ridiculous the Christian religion really is. The only thing good that came out of Christianity was the story of Jesus, the symbolism, art and music.Children should not view this film."	2.0	$$$ in Mel's bank account.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ALXFQ91OW9ZTC	Diana	I think the whole story here is this...we, as human beings take our lives for granted at times. This is a wake up call for all Christians to be humble and look at our lives as they are today and thank the Lord for what we have and what we are able to become. This movie is meant to make us suffer. Suffer along with Christ as his family and followers did that day. We are meant to see what he when through, for you and me. So, we sit thru a 2 hour movie and we see graffic violence against a man who gave his life for us. We needed this, right this day. We need to understand why we are here and what we are to be doing with out lives. We are not to be throwing away our lives and blowing all our chances to be kind human beings. We as a nation needed this film to wake us up to reality...We have to much make believe in our lives and we needed a wake up call! Thank you Mel Gibson for taking the risks to get this movie made and getting the message out. A message we sometimes take for granted.	5.0	We take our lives for granted.	2004-02-25	2	1	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AWS4VRQ2K60T9	diana valetine	"Mel Gibson is a brave heart. He showed that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for all of our sins. He did not show all of it.Jesus Christ was beaten so badly that no one could recognize Him.So,in reality the movie The Passion of The Christ does not show all the violence as the world seems to think.Every hit was for us who have sinned. Pilate is not the only one responsible for what happened to Jesus Christ;In John Chp.19 v.11 ""Jesus answered, ""You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin."" Who was He talking about Caiaphas the high priest or Judas? Jesus Christ had Forgiven All before He had gone.In Luke Chp. 23 v.34,Then Jesus said,"" Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.""So,Jesus Christ has Forgiven All.I am so glad that Mr.Mel Gibson had the Brave Heart to make a film that is a learning tool.We must repent from our sins and we also must forgive.In Luke chp.11 v.1-4Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him,""Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.""So He said to them, ""When you pray,say:Our Father In heaven,Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us day by day our daily bread. and forgive us our sins,For we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation. But deliver us from the evil one.""Jesus Christ is the Miracle,The Son of God.In John chap.11 v.9-10 Jesus answered, "" Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day,he does not stumble,because he sees the light of this world.""But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.""Jesus Christ is the light within us, not the light that shines for 12 hours in a day in this world.I can not wait until this movie comes out in video or dvd.The Kingdom of God is inside of you and all around you. Not in buildings made of wood and stone. Split a peice of wood and you will find me. Lift a stone and I am there.This little saying above does not mean not to go to church and worship.Greater is He who is within me than he who is in this world."	5.0	The Passion of The Christ	2004-04-15	8	4	4

Its dramatic interpretation of the final days of Jesus sweeps you away to that time with not only the pain and suffering of Jesus but also of Mary's pain of watching her son go through this torture. Very well played out, you leave with all  emotions wrapped up in one but the strongest is your believe in God. I think everyone should view what Jesus did for us.

I am not a cryer at movies but this one had me in tears about half way through it. On the big screen and through Mel Gibson's eyes you feel as if you are there and are helpless to do anything. The suffering is intense and at times it takes your breath away. You can't bare seeing it, yet you can't look away. Mel does some flash backs to his ministery to kind of help you beath in between the pain. I can't imagine the horror it must have been for his mother to watch, all the while knowing Christ did not want her to intervien in this torture. This is not an entertainment movie, just an account of the truth for Christians. I have come to understand the great sacrifice that Christ made on our behalf. I do not see the Anti-Semitism that so Jews are reporting. Since this was a Jew who did not hate those who did this to him, I don't see where there is hate to be returned for the deed. Maybe those who understand the New Testament can realize it in the right context. A big two thumbs up! Bravo!

They both had nothing but tears of joy to see the vivid affirmation on that theater screen that they were so deeply loved - as did we all.  Brutal? Yes!  Painful?  Definitely!  Heart wrenching?  Most certainly - as it should be.  It wasn't a ""walk in the park"" for Christ.  He knew before-hand, and He still chose to SUFFER for us so that we could have and enjoy life in abundance.Mel Gibson's The Passion depicts the truth as Jesus Christ (The Truth) experienced it according to the written gospels. It wasn't a pretty site, but it is a beautiful reality.  Sometimes the truth hurts ... so that you can be healed.""You will know them by their fruits"" - at all three of the theatrical viewing's I went to (apart from church assemblies) I witnessed several groups and couples enter with negative and often cruel words and countenances, and yet leave in tears of conviction and love with their arms around each other.  Conviction mind you - NOT condemnation.  Since then I've heard numerous reports of transformed lives.  Transformed to glory and goodness, yet never once violence or cruelty.  Looks like good fruit to me!In conclusion and with all love, I'll remind and implore the Sad-u-ccees to ""Touch Not The Anointed.""

It is disturbingly graphic but not in an entertaining way (e.g. Pulp Fiction) or in a way that shakes the viewer's consciousness (e.g. the Grey Zone). Instead it presents a deeply dogmatic and outdated view of the final days of Jesus.  I am non religious yet I have seen films that opened the minds of viewers on the subject of Jesus from The Last Temptation of Christ to The Gospel According to Saint Matthew to Jesus of Montreal. What we have here instead is Mel Gibson's Birth of a Nation with a disturbing ideology that was savagely and appropriately lampooned on South Park's ""The Passion of the Jew"" (kudos to Blockbuster for putting the two titles for rent next to each other)."	1.0	Depressing but in a Bad Way	2005-10-29	39	15	24

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1CBCT441L98JN	"""discofied"""	i have three main things to say about this movie. first, to all of those that say this is an over blooded and violent movie - you missed the point. the movie concerns with the passion of the christ, or in other words - his suffering. and it was essential to focus on his sufferings and him being tortured. one of the most important ideas about christ is that by paying with his own blood - he is exonorating us all. the blood of christ is very well known to be the most important symbols of christianity. and we get to see a lot of that in the movie. THE SECOND issue is the question of history, scripture, truth and what's in between. and for that i can say that the vatican has long ago declared this to be nonsense, and that the jews are not to be blamed for the crucifiction of christ. the jews did not have authority under the roman empire. and pontius pilatus is described in the movie as a nice man who has a hard time killing jesus. history tells us that he was rather a very cruel megalomaniac and sadistic person. the movie doen not add up with the real proof historians all over the world had found about what really happend. AND THE THIRD POINT is that this movie has a flashback in slow motion every 5 minutes. it takes jesus more than half an hour to go with his cross up the hill. really boring actually.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A6YK7TEYVSSA3	DJ_Bitter	I have to give this movie five stars because it's been quite a while since I had watched a movie that gotten completely in my system and this film did. It was so hard to watch. It literally felt like you were there, watching him be crucified. At times I seriously wanted to turn away but my eyes were glued the whole time. I have to commend Mel Gibson for his bravery. Even though I am not Christian, I have to admit that this film was well done.I do have to say that it is not easy to watch. I literally felt drained after watching this film and I do believe that this isn't a movie that I am going to watch again anytime soon. This was an experience. That is so rare in filmmaking today. But along side the feeling of draining, I also felt inspired. I was touched deeply by this film. It was amazing what Jesus went through for others.Jim Cavavzel (sp) is brilliant as Jesus. He portrayed both the warmth and the compassion that Jesus had for all people. There was something about his presence. The love that he carried in his big brown eyes. As far as being too European, I found he was more realistic than others. I know he was bloodied and beatened but there was something about him that made me want to be near him.Also as well, I want to point out Rosalinda Celentano's performance as Satan. I found her both frightening but beautiful at the same time. Some of the visuals regarding her deeply disturbed me but I found her fascinating due to the fact she was androgynous. My father could not tell if she was male or female. I'd honestly like to see her in more things.Another thing that captivated me was the way it was shot and the musical score. It was one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in terms of cinematography and setting. It felt so authentic. The music was definately moving. It sounds so ethereal and otherworldly but also adding to the film's experience.But over all, this was a film that was highly brutal,deeply moving, an experience and disturbing all at once.	5.0	Brutal..	2004-09-05	8	5	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3KWAGK3T5FX0Q	"D. Jeter ""DwayneJ"""	"The first point I would like to make is that anyone that viewed this film is responsible for the message contained in it.  This was not a film about emotion, brutallity, anti-seminism or the cruelty of Rome.  This was a power packed film about man's relationship to God.  The fact that Mr. Gibson was inspired by his own faith and relationship with God and not emotional content shows the commitment that he has and the courage to tell the story as it was.  The cinematography was excellent, the acting marvelous in light of the weighty subject depicted.  Some have said that this film is not for children or those of a frail mein.  I object and suggest that any child that has reached the age of accountability must see this film so that they can make their own mind up about this event.  The weak or frail that are looking for the moment of ultimate truth must see this film.  If we look at this film and judge it by the same standard that we judged ""King of Kings"" starring Jeffrey Hunter or the ""Bible"" with an all star cast then I believe that we miss the point entirely.  Mel Gibson is the first director in Hollywood that has the intestinal fortitude (guts) to tell the story as it really happened and please note that often those accused of a capital crime did not survive the scouraging in order to be crucified.  God's wrath was not the object of this movie either.  Why would God willing send His own son to a horrifying death in order to redeem mankind and then take it out on the very humanity that that death was planned for before Adam and Eve were even created.  That would be tantamount to murder. There is much debate about the false doctrine of ""Evaloution"" and I submit that this film in all it's cinematic gore and brutallity forces a decision to be made by everyone that sees it.  The fact that Mel Gibson invested 33 million dollars of his own finances into this project shows dedication, sacrifice & commitment.  Don't forget that those that would not support Gibson financially, now wish that they had, since the movie has made approximately 100 times Mel's investment.  Hollywood would rather pervert the Gospels (good news) and portray Jesus Christ as a man with homosexual tendicies than tell the truth, for obvious reasons.  It appeared to me that even the cast of this film was changed by it.  In summary ""The Passion of the Christ"" is the focal point, the pivital point in the relationship between God and man and the attemps throughout the ages of the ""evil one"" Satan formerly Lucifer ""Son of the Morning"" and the chief archangel of God, to thwart God's plan to redeem (buy back) man from sin and bondage to this current world system.  If you miss this point of the film then you reduce the ""Passion"" to entertainment and that diminishes all of humanity.  I don't care if you are a believer of not, the healthy do not need the services of a doctor, but the unhealthy do.  Mel Gibson made a film about a choice between heaven and hell and everyone that sees this film will be held accountable for what they now know are the facts.  The cinematography, look and feel of the sets was tangible and unforgettable.  The acting was very moving and well done.  The wardrobe was very well done and the music was paced right in time with the sequence of events.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A17SV57W7NRC6D	D. Kays	I believe alot of people are forgetting the whole point of why Jesus sufferred the way He did. They forget the Father, the Eternal Father. He sent His Eternal Son and Jesus' suffering and passion was the way God the Father chose to help bring people back to himself. For God the Father to send Grace to the world and to bless the world the Father sees His Son on the cross and in this way He blesses the world.What pleased the Father was the willingness of His Son to undergo the Passion. To see His Son on the cross is not what pleased the Father, no, it was His Son's willingness to suffer. Jesus could have easily prevented anyone taking His Life. He is God. Yet His willingness to undergo suffering was motivated by His Love for us and to reveal to us the real enemy of our souls that is the devil. God needed to wrestle us from the clutches of the devil. His death actually defeated the devil and revealed the devil as he truly is and inagurated the Kingdom He wants to establish based on Love and Mercy. How could God do it in any other way. Most of the world had rejected Him and continues to reject Him today yet His Son and the Remembrance of the Passion of His Son, the Eternal Father sends His Grace especially for the forgiveness of sins so that we may be able to receive The Holy Spirit. Can you see what sin did to man. Sin did not change God. It changed man. The cost to heal man was the sending of His Son. And for those who reflect on this cost and realize their own condition He is then able to heal them. It was God's Love for us that motivated Him to send His Son.	5.0	do not forget the Eternal Father	2007-08-07	2	1	1

The cinemetography was absolutely brilliant.  The actors were more than amazing.  You need to understand that this movie is all about the violent ending to Jesus's life.  This is not a happy feel good movie about his deeds nor was it intended to be.  The movie pulls you in and makes you feel Jesus's suffering and pain.  And to see Mary suffer watching her son be tortured to death was very gut wrenching especially if you have kids of your own.  This move has made so much money for one reason, it is excellent.

But for a movie that meant so much to Mel Gibson, it's almost certain they withheld all the features for a future version to be released during the Holidays. That includes footage and text that caused much of the controversy in the first place over the film which was cut.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3MD3EWWMZPRVO	D. Mart	"Do I think the film would have had less of an effect had it been less violent?  Yes, and here is why:  so many times do we see religious films that are, in effect, boring.  They tell the story, making no -- if not hardly -- any attempts at really showing us the pain; the tragedy; the guilt; and, ultimately, the un-dying love and affection.What ""The Passion of the Christ"" doesis allow us to revel in human emotion.  Yes it's violent, but the violence only makes it that much stronger.  With every bone-crunching sound, we feel Jesus's pain.  With every flesh-gouging whip, we share in his torment.  With every ounce of blood he loses, we shed a tear.  And throughout this ordeal, with every bit of faith, strength and unconditional love he produces, we feel him as a human being, and share in his triumph.Jesus was a great man; he ""is"" a great man.  Jesus Christ is the ultimate epitome of love, strength and courage.  No matter what happened, he stuck by what he believed to be true.  And thus, by he end of the film, it is his triumph, not his defeat, that shall be rewarded.  Through his masterful direction, Mel Gibson portrays this in such a beautiful way; so beautiful -- almost Heavenly -- that it simply defies what we had always learned about matters of the heart.""The Passion of the Christ"" is a beautiful film.  It is also an extremely violent and gory film.  But the violence only underscores the emotion and heartache.  After seeing this movie, I left the theater in awe, practically in dis-belief of everything I had just witnessed (In fact, I could barely speak during the next ten minutes).If not for the huge amount of violence, we would not have had the build-up for what would eventually become a streaming river of human emotion and heart-ache.  It would have been easy for Mel Gibson to lessen the intensity of the violence, but then he would be risking slf-pity; a feeling of self-pity for Jesus.  And in a film such as this, we don't want to pity Jesus.  We want to love him.  To embrace him.  To invite him into our hearts.  And how do we do this?  By feeling what he felt.  By experiencing the injusties carried out against him.  By eventually soaring with him on eagle's wings up to Heaven; up to where there's no pain; no fear; just love.And that's what we should all aspire for; what we should all ""aspire"" to be.  He taught us that love -- great, powerful, un-conditional love -- is the ultimate triumph.  It is the ultimate gift.  That something as awesome as this should not be automatically considered wrong, but rather it should be accepted and celebrated.  That taking in younger children is alright, as long as it's in an innocent fashion.  This is not innapropriate.  It's love.  Pure and Godly love.Thus, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is not only about Jesus.  Thus, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is about society in general and its hang-ups on certain issues.And thus, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" deserves nothing but the highest praise."	5.0	Masterful Epic; Violence Only Underscores the Awesome Beauty	2004-08-09	10	8	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	I only wish that the majority of people flocking to see this film would leave their emotions at the door.  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, unfortunately, seems to perpetuate division--to re-energize those who fervently believe the gospels, to alienate those who fear the film's message will create a Christian ethnocentric backlash.  There seems to be little common ground, which is a shame, as the movie should be judged solely on its merits.And THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a powerful, gripping, riveting, often disturbing film depicting the last twelve hours of Christ's life.  It is more than obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into this work--yet the symbolism and interpretation winding in and out of the story reveals Gibson's agenda to magnify the suffering and brutality well beyond suspension of disbelief.  His depiction of a surreal, androgynous Satan--a Satan releasing a serpent, a Satan carrying a deformed baby while Christ is being tortured--is not only a departure from the gospels but an artistic gimmick designed to appeal to emotion rather than reason.  And it is reason, rather than emotion, that should be addressed when the subject matter of this film is so volatile.Personally, I don't think the film is anti-Semitic at all; but that is a conclusion best saved for each viewer to draw.  If anything, the movie was anti-Roman; I was amazed at the consistent portrayal of snarling, sadistic, drunken, and nefarious Roman soldiers.  Would it not stand to reason that some of the soldiers--if only a few--would be shocked, disturbed, saddened, or horrified by the events of the day?  Gibson would not have us believe so.James Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci, Ivano Marescotti, and the rest of the cast give spellbinding, powerful performances.  Morgenstern stands out as Mary, mother of Jesus; her facial expressions alone--as her son is savagely and brutally tortured--speak volumes.  I was particularly moved when she ran to assist her son as he fell while carrying the cross; the movie then depicted a flashback of a young Mary coming to the aid of her fallen little boy.  In fact, the flashbacks depicting Christ as a young man and as a prophet were wonderful, but few and far between.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST succeeded in that it made me think, and it made me feel; it disappointed in that I could not help but be distracted by a rather zealous agenda.--D.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1T8CV2VBAFXZO	D. Mueller	This was in my opinion not a movie but an experience. Mel Gibson did such a great job of potraying the last hours of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's life. The movie was so moving and touching. I can't imagine having any of that done to me. Unfortunately, Jesus really didn't have a choice. That was foretold to happen to Jesus so we could be washed clean from our sins and have everlasting life.And to those who think that this movie was unrealistic in some respects you're right. It wasn't entirely realistc...because Jesus looked even worse then what they showed. In the Bible it clearly states that you couldn't even recognize Jesus that was how badly beaten he was.But, as to why no one helped him when he was being beaten or why he let them arrest him it was because it was foretold for it to happen that way and Jesus knew that and so did his followers.Also, people who loved this movie like me aren't dumb. No one is dumb everyone has their own opinion and that's fine to God. But, this is what happened to our Lord and Savior and those who don't believe it to be realistic must not be those that are walking in the light. Because anyone who was would know that this movie was very realistic and that it was meant to happen that way. I love you Jesus!	5.0	A Life Changing Experience	2004-07-05	11	3	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2MT7UITGJV9BG	D. Ohton	I have listened to, and also read many people's reaction to Mel's &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, and have found many of them very interesting. Most people either love it or hate it. Those who love it say it &quot;opened their eyes to Christ's suffering&quot; and those who hated it say it was a &quot;torcherfest.&quot; I think one thing people fail to realize is that this movie is based for the most part on fact. This is the reality of what Jesus truly went through for the sin of the world, and thoses who think that Mel went overboard on the &quot;torcher&quot; scences should know that the Bible says that Jesus wasn't even recognizable as a man due to the severity of his beating and his beard was plucked from his face. After seeing the movie I realized that most people, including myself, couldn't handle a small glimps of what Jesus truly went through. I think everyone should see this movie at least once just to get an idea of the cost that Christ paid. Any anyone who thinks this movie is or might be anti-sematic should know that Jesus was a Jew who said &quot;I lay down My life that I may take it again.&quot; The Jews didn't kill Jesus, Jesus laid down his life for us. If anyone put Jesus to death on the cross, we all did.	4.0	For those who have an interest in &quot;Truth&quot;	2004-07-22	14	8	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1OBM38R2NOIR7	Doris Morgan	Passion of the ChristAt Last someone dared to attempt to show what the crucifixion must have really looked like!  At least that is how I experienced it from reading the gospels.  This film was like balm to my thirsty and hungry soul.  The director-financier Mel Gibson wanted to show on camera what the suffering and crucifixion of Christ may have really looked like.  From what I have gathered according to the scriptures and research into what crucifixion does to the body of its victim, Mel Gibson got it pretty close.  Jesus' body after the scourging was just a quivering mass of flesh, the fact that he was able to carry the cross any distance at all was a miracle in itself, due to the massive loss of blood.  What a powerful tool for educational purposes; be it Catholic, Protestant or Jewish.  We need to understand our common past history, not place blame on any one group, but to bring understanding and health to our communities of faith.I have seen the crucifixion in other movies; King of Kings, Jesus, and Jesus of Nazareth to name a few. But the crucifixion scene always felt too clean for me.  It is interesting to note that director Franco Zeffirelli, Jesus of Nazareth, omitted most of the suffering and violence of the crucifixion that Jesus went through because he didn't want to offend the audience.  However without the suffering that is depicted in the Passion of the Christ, Jesus is just or could be an ordinary Holy Man or prophet delivering his message from God.The message that Mel Gibson brings across is that his sin, my sin, and your sin put Jesus on that Cross.  This is portrayed beautifully by the angles of the camera.  To try to make more than this, takes away from the meaning of the passion itself.  During the scourging I could sense the tension and angst of the moment, several times I jumped in my seat. Even though I watched this film twice I still felt the same feelings and emotions the second time around. At times I even felt like I was the one who had swung the whip, or just pounded the nail into Jesus' flesh!  There were so many surreal moments packed into this film, so much so that I actually felt like I was part of the action.  The actors did a marvelous job James Caviezel, as Jesus was the very portrayal of suffering as was, Maia Morgensten, as Mary his mother.Another point that I want to make is that the genre of this film is not easy to put into just one type.  Unlike Gibson's Braveheart, this well done film juxtaposes several types of genre: Drama in the form of the horrific due to the violence portrayed, yet historical in nature. (One just needs to study human nature to see the sadistic qualities of the solders, when allowed to vent their frustrations.)  Educational since the death and resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of the faith of many Christians.  I would not say that this film is entertainment.  The realism and meaning portrayed is much too deep for that.  This is also not a film or movie where one can just sit back and relax, like Schindler's List it catches you in the action and sweeps you along with it.	5.0	The Cornerstone of Faith	2004-04-01	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A35Z6A2J7CFW2	"dosers ""dosers"""	So 'Passion' has finally made it to the screen, buyoed by the countless churchgroups that bought advance tickets in praise of a movie they haven't seen. It's tough to critique this work from a non-religious standpoint - and I am sure the mere existence of a Hollywood-movie must appeal to Christians and religious people in general, as it seems they are finally taken seriously by liberal Hollywood.But let's look at the movie itself; clocking in at what seems to be 3hours plus (in reality, a bit over 2 hours), this movie proved to be very gory, laden with 'effects' (the non CG kind) and, frankly, empty. The movie drags on for most of the time, doing it's job to desensitive you to a gore-fest unseen since the latest Wes Craven flick. You can argue that this story is based on historic truth or is complete fiction - regardless, it borrows from horror movies just as much (if not more) than from much more enjoyable 'bible' movies from Ziffereli's Christ to the old standby Ben Hur. And that's what it comes down to in the end: The movie is pointless unless you want to use it as some evangelical tool. I found it boring and frankly not at all enjoyable (Realizing this is not the happy kind of enjoyment Gibson was going for anyway). ... - the movie's depiction of Jews (who do seem to beg Pilatus for Jesus' murder a lot more than seems plausible, considering he wasn't that nice a guy) is present, but pales in the background of the whole movie. Apart from being more sensitive to Jews, Gibson could have been more sensitive to his poor moviegoers in general.I will say that I applaud Gibson for bringing his 'vision' to screen as he, apparently, intended. The movie feels a lot more expensive than it was. Too bad he didn't leave a lot of room for his actors to act anything besides enduring a record (seemed like 20 minutes to me) flogging scene and other horror fests right out of The Birds or The Exorcist.The movie is bloody, gory, and, to me, devoid of anything new to learn about this person.	1.0	Gory, empty and pointless	2004-02-24	298	62	236

So I have repurchased the movie again because I remember how the movie captivated me so and I wanted to be able to go back and watch it time and again so as to not loose the feeling of what GOD did or for us. As he gave his life on the cross for our SINS. To me being a convert, I have read most of the BIBLE, but to watch a movie and to sit down with the BIBLE to follow it in front of me and be able to actually follow the movie and the BIBLE was astounding. Areas of the BIBLE and the movie have never left my memory. The movie is extremely well made. Yes, there are areas that enhanced the movie's path, but over-all the movie is dear to my heart. If you have any emotions, this movie will bring them out. It to can also allow you to feel pain if you have any feelings of others. If you have not seen this movie, change your life and watch it. It shows you what HUMILITY really is, just case you do not understand humility. You shall not be disappointed.	5.0	THE PASSION OF CHRIST	2013-03-19	1	1	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1RWEFMZZNYX2H	Douglas LaRose	"I went to see this movie with a very open mind. Initially I was pleased with the cinematography and a little dissapointed with the somewhat contrived acting. The opening part of the movie is by far the most interesting and rich in terms of storyline and aesthetic beauty. This part of the movie is what nails it in the two-star range. What ensues, however, is probably the most deplorable attempt at sensory manipulation I have ever witnessed in my life.In a time when neoconservatism and counterfundamentalist-fundamentalism gripped the United States by the jowels this movie made a somewhat fortuitous entrance onto the world stage. As the bells of war sent young American soldiers out on the battlefield to defend Western hegemonic positions by way of ""the Almighty"" (Bush's great justification) this movie danced across movie theater screens and attempted to do much more than tell the story of the life of Jesus. This movie turns Jesus into a symbol of cultural supremacy, a source of endless blood and suffering, and the American flag manifested in human flesh.As I sat and watched the hour and a half of torture unfold before my eyes I looked around the theater to see the faces of the families which so many claim to exemplify ""family values."" What these children were watching was not a recreation of a myth aimed at reinforcing social solidarity, but a blatant piece of sensory manipulation which aimed at reinforcing xenophobia and notions of cultural superiority."	2.0	Violence & Religion	2004-06-27	41	16	25

Some such as Forrest Gump, We Were Soldiers, Titanic ... but this extremely violent portrayal of Jesus' crucifixion has brought me to complete utter silence.  It gave me quite an emotional experience.The movie portrays Jesus living his last 12 hours of life on earth, fulfilling God's Purpose for all mankind -- ALL mankind!  Yet sadly, many cultures don't seem to get the picture.  The film clearly illustrates the brutal hell Jesus went through, from sweating drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane to being pertrayed by a kiss, from facing powerful Roman leaders to being spit upon; from enduring non-stop torment of razor-sharp metal on a whip to finally bearing a rough, heavy wooden cross.  I was utterly surprised to notice how many times Jesus had stumbled while bearing that cross, yet I assumed that Jesus was going through utter pain at the same time.  Oh friends, he did this JUST FOR YOU!I have to admit something was telling me that I was going to walk out of this movie stunned, so I had to warn my spritual kin with me that this film was going to contain extreme graphic violence.  I was right all along!  You can't comprehend the intense suffering Jesus went through.  He saw it all along.  He had a ticket to escape from Jerusalem and go on an expedition or something.  He could've left when Pontious Pilate offered him the chance, not once, but many times.  He could've blah blah blah -- but He decided not to.  He knew all along He was called to fulfill the Scripture.I was not surprised to see other movie goers wiping tears from their faces.  I can understand why this movie generated controversy to the media.  But hey, we need something like this in a generation where entertainment is venom-saturated.  You know what I'm talking about.One final summary is that this is without a doubt the greatest film which portrays Jesus' crucifixion.  Also featured in the motion picture is segments of the gospel in Jesus' earlier life, like the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper.  I would recommended this to EVERY believer and non-believer, but NOT to the sensitive-to-graphic-violence.	5.0	[Holds His Peace]	2004-02-25	8	7	1

It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it.

However, I recently watched it online (my only viewing). As it was, I skipped through it, seeing more than enough in about 30 minutes. After my albeit incomplete viewing, I was surprised to see the high percentage of 5 star comments.I'm not into slasher-sadism flicks because there's too much of it in far too many societies today. It's a given that our ancient past was one of extreme violence and life was held as cheap. The film is an incomprehensible and pathetic attempt, but, at what? I saw, nor heard, any message for the masses, unless Gibson meant it as a reminder or portrayal of what Jesus suffered for humanity. For Gibson to make violence and sadism the main theme of the film is useless, not to mention a waste of huge film-making dollars, unless of course he simply wanted to make an ultimate kind of slasher-sadism flick. If that's it, he succeeded. The photography/filming is very good and the actors were fine, but all in all, it is what it is: Your basic slasher-sadism flick, which unfortunately used the popular topic and figure of Jesus as the target, or object, of the violence.I've been a fan of Gibson's earlier films, but since I saw this one? He's now bumped down on my list. Sadly, I don't know if I'll want to watch his early films again, which I have in my DVD collection. If making this film was his ""passion,"" or his dream, I am now finding it harder to appreciate what he used to do so well.

It is not typical movie ""loosely based on"" anything, which usually means there are some true parts and some fake parts.  This film follows the Bible completely and is therefore a wonderful teaching tool and extremely powerful experience.What I loved most about The Passion, was that it gave me something I'd never had in church.  I've read the Bible, I've paid attention in Sunday School and Church and I know what Jesus did for me when He died so that I might be saved.  On a CEREBRAL level and with my faith, I know it and believe it.  However, this film gave me a solid VISUAL that grabbed my heart and brought it in line with my mind and faith.  Knowing & believing is one thing.  But to see with my own eyes how much Jesus loved me is an experience which I will always cherish.  I believe it will do this for you.Yes, there is a tremendous amount of violence.  And quite frankly, I find it funny that people in THIS country (USA), home of the murderous villians responsible for the almost total genocide of Native Indians and the kidnapping, rape, enslavement and death of Blacks for over 300 years, would have the audacity to pretend they are shocked by the violence of the film.  I attribute this to the hypocritical nature of people in the US who are so desperate to remove GOD from everything (except the money, of course), that they would even dane to complain about violence in a movie; sort of like Mike Tyson complaining about someone pinching him.  What you see in this film is what actually happened.  And you NEED to see that to have a full understanding of what Jesus suffered and WHY.There were sniffles throughout the theatre during the film and I had to grab a tissue or two myself.  However, when the first nail is driven into His hand, that's when I broke down and truly experienced feelings of being completely unworthy of the sacrifice, yet thankful that He was willing to give His life in such a way for me.  This also marked the first time I'd seen a film where NO ONE jumped up at the end.  Everyone sat and had to recover before moving from their seat. Powerful!If nothing else, the film The Passion of the Christ should truly teach you how to forgive.  For, as Jesus was beaten to within an inch of His life, nailed to the cross, hung, bled and prepared to die, He still spoke out ""Father, FORGIVE Them For They Know Not What They Do"".Kinda puts that whole ""she cut me off on the highway and now I want her dead"" thing into perspective, doesn't it?Dr. Braxy :o)"	5.0	Powerful Is A Soft Word To Describe This One!	2004-04-29	7	3	4

It's hard to think of a Mel Gibson movie that doesn't involve someone (often Mel) suffering prolonged, excruciating pain.  I'm sure there are exceptions (I didn't see Air America).Usually the torture is part of the plot, but in this movie the torture is the plot.  The victim is Jesus Christ, who recovers and goes on to be one of the most worshipped people in history.  In fact he's currently #1, with a substantial lead over Allah and Buddha.In Lethal Weapon 1 Mel Gibson plays Martin Riggs, who is tortured by a diabolical character named Endo, but then recovers and goes on to shoot Gary Busey and have Christmas dinner with Danny Glover.Mel Gibson was inspired to make The Passion of the Christ by his very literal interpretation of The New Testament of the Bible (also a huge bestseller, ranked #1 ahead of ""Quotations from Chairman Mao"" and ""The American Spelling Book"").Possible sequel:  In the future, when fuel shortages and global disasters triggered by conflicts over oil have plunged our ancestors into a dystopian nightmare populated by ruthless gangs who terrorize innocent civilians in search of gasoline, people turn for solace to a historical record of someone who can offer them salvation.  Naturally they find the Lethal Weapon Box Set, and a new religion is formed around a heroic man who was able to withstand torture and abuse in the name of all that is good.

It is more than a movie, seeing ""The Passion of the Christ"" is literally a spiritual experience that will not leave you the same. You will be changed one way or the other after seeing what Jesus suffered. The realism of this portrayal captures the historical context of the days Jesus was on earth. Use of the original language adds to the authenticity. Similarly the ethnicity of the actors adds another layer to foundation of capturing history on film.This is an instant classic indeed. Any objective viewer who sees it cannot deny this fact. It is ""other,"" i.e., it is in a category of its own. Yes it might be listed as a ""religious film,"" but it is so much more.

I had trouble enjoying the film because of all the extra material that is not in scriptures.Then I found the source of all the non-biblical content of this film.==""Director Gibson intended fidelity to the New Testament, yet expanded the screenplay by making use of additional sources. The principal, most controversial source is The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ the meditations of the stigmatic, German nun Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824), as told to the poet Clemens Brentano. Her vision of Christ's Passion depicts certain Jews as more vicious and bloodthirsty than the Romans ruling Judaea.

That said, I thought this movie was disguisting.  There is nothing artistic about it.  Its not that I cannot handle violence, I have seen many violent movies, but this one was nothing BUT violence.  My local Lutheran pastor told our church that we should watch the Matrix Revolutions instead of The Passion, because the Matrix spends about 15 times as much on resurrection as the Passion does.  The movie is like a masochist's porno.  It did absolutely NOTHING to stimulate my faith or mind.  Saying that the message of this movie is love is DEFINATELY a stretch. People, the movie is 2 hours and some odd minutes of violence!  Where's the love??? Concerning the ""anti-semetic"" aspect, I do not think that this film was intentionally anti-semetic.  However it caused some of those types of reactions, for instance in Colorado a pastor at a church put up a sign on their billboard that said ""the Jews killed Jesus!""Lastly, shame on the people that say that those who aren't moved or didnt like this film have some sort of lack of faith or open-mindedness.  Those types of judgments are themselves close-minded.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2OY0OJHNWSA7H	Dustin Emerson	"The other night, I went to see Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" again. I must admit I didn't like it any better this time. I thought that, on second viewing, the movie would just fly by, as so often happens when you resee a film. On the contrary, I found it long and, at one point, I actually started nodding off. (Not during the flogging scene, I can assure you of that. I felt more distant and remote then, less viscerally affected by the violence.)  While I didn't like ""The Passion"" any better, I did come away with a greater understanding of the imagery Gibson uses -- more specifically, its roots in scripture. For instance, I realized that he was portraying Judas as mad -- possessed, in fact -- based on the gospel verse that says, ""The devil entered into him."" At the beginning, when Jesus steps on the serpent and kills it, that echoes a verse in Genesis: ""He shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for his heel."" This verse has traditionally been seen as God's promise of a Redeemer for a fallen humanity.  The problem is, how many moviegoers today will be aware of these biblical references -- even Christians? Gibson's film is obviously a testament to his own faith. But he has made the assumption that everybody else shares that belief, and has thus made a film that, in effect, preaches to the converted. What about those who do not believe, or who simply do not know about Jesus? Gibson's ""Passion"" will not reach them because it does not speak, does not even try to speak, their language.  The other problem is that Gibson's version of the death of Christ is a hodge-podge of biblical influences, popular piety and his own idiosyncratic touches. Jesus's trek along the Via Dolorosa reflects, not the gospels, but the Stations of the Cross you find in every Catholic church. Many of the 15 stations portray events not mentioned in the gospels. Again, how many people in the audience will be able to separate fact from fiction?  One final note: ""The Passion"" has been accused of fostering anti-Semitism, yet it tells the story of One who was Himself a Jew. More than that, His death took place against the backdrop of one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, Passover. When Mary says, ""Why is this night different from all other nights?"" she echoes the question asked by the youngest male member of every observant Jewish family on Passover night. And Jesus's Last Supper was a Passover meal. This is hinted at, but not fully brought out in the film.  In short, Gibson takes too much for granted, assumes that his audience shares his knowledge of the Christian faith -- and misses a golden opportunity to explain that faith to others."	4.0	Preaching to the converted	2008-08-29	3	1	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1EBD2U23BP04Y	"Dusty Saks ""Baseball Nut"""	The Passion is an awesome, thought-provoking film.  I've never been so moved by a movie in my life.  It starts off with Jesus getting tempted by Satan, then goes on to show his betrayal by Judas Iscariot, who later hangs himself out of guilt.  I was amazed at how fairly the villains were portrayed, mostly Judas and Pilate.  They weren't evil charicatures, they were real people and their motivations, whether or not you agreed with them, could be understood.  And when Jesus is dragging his cross to Calvary and we see that Satan is still tempting him--pure genius.  I never thought about it that way!The focus of the movie seems to be the physical suffering Jesus endured to save his people, and while it's probably somewhat exaggerated (I don't remember anything in the New Testament about that whip thingy with the metal spikes on the end of it) it's still painful to watch.It answers a lot of questions, but the most important still remains: if Jesus played baseball, would he be a pitcher or a batter?  I'm leaning toward batter.  He was a carpenter after all, and all those years swinging a hammer would probably translate well to swinging a bat.  And, as we know from that part in the Bible where He gets all mad at those people selling stuff in the church and starts knocking over their booths, he had pretty good upper body strength.Don't get me wrong.  I'm not being sacriligious.  It's just one of those things I wonder about, like did Buddha smoke and would the prophet Mohammed pose for a charicature?Again, don't get me wrong.  A powerful and thought-provoking story it is, but it needs baseball.  Maybe Mel Gibson could make a sequel that has baseball, but then that creates another question.  Would Jesus play for the Angels, or would that be an insult?	5.0	Amazing Story!	2006-05-22	24	7	17

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A307H0MU0FKCZV	"D. Waldrep ""Leftover Porkchops"""	"Why would you want to subject yourself to this film more than once?  Aside from the fact that at one point Jesus and Pilate are speaking to each other in different languages (a point where I actually laughed out loud), there is almost zero biblical significance in this film.  Rather than take it's ""accuracy"" from the Bible, as Gibson claims, the Passion takes most of its content from the passion-plays of the Dark Ages.  Wanna know why it's called ""the Passion""?  It isn't because Jesus was such a great guy; no, the ""passion"" of the title originally referred to the overwhelming emotion of the Jews in their persecution of him.  See, in the theology of the Dark Ages, passion and the emotions (yes, even love) were considered bestial and base aspects of humanity, and it was these ""passions"" (of the Pharisees and Jews) directed against Jesus during his trial that were blamed for the crucifixion and gave the piece it's title.Note: I'm referring to the theology of the Dark Ages; I'm not calling Mel Gibson anti-Semitic.  But the piece has those underlying messages; orginally, ""The Passion"" was meant specifically to incite anti-Semitism, and since Gibson has used those Middle Age performances as his largest source, these messages are still there.Think I'm lying?  Read your gospels; there's about, oh, twenty or so sentences total about the death of Christ.  The four gospels don't even agree on what his last words were.  Also, you'll see a reference to the Veil of Veronica in the film as well, a Christian artifact that, like the Holy Grail, has yet to be found and therefore has no ""factual"" basis.  Speaking of ""fact"", Aramaic's been a dead language for over a thousand years; no one's ever heard it spoken.  Gibson's interpretation of that language is therefore highly suspect and guesswork at best.Honestly, this was one of the worst films I've ever seen.  I'd rather watch Mystery Science Theater (or any of the flicks they watch in Mystery Science Theater, for that matter) than see this piece of rubbish again.  Be Christian, that's cool and all; that's not what bothers me.  What bothers me is when Christians (to paraphrase the South Park boys) start focusing on how Jesus died and not on how he lived."	1.0	This DVD Might Be a Fun Frisbee, But That's About It	2004-10-25	49	20	29

A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	No movie in years has inspired half as much controversy as Mel Gibson's labor of love, the intimately religious movie &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; A gritty, dark, bloody retelling of Christ's final hours, this takes the old cleaned-up Bible stories and throws them out. Instead, we have a vivid, shocking picture that you won't be able to forget.This is, in essence, a cinematic passion play: We are shown Jesus's (Jim Caviezel) temptation by a surprisingly eerie Satan (Rosalinda Celentano), and his arrest by the Romans. His apostles flee away, leaving his mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern), follower Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) to follow him on the road to where he would be crucified...&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was one of the unexpected hits of the last year -- it had a tiny budget, a seemingly small fanbase, and was made strictly according to the Catholic New Testament. But it struck a chord in people -- not just the subject matter, but the fact that Gibson was so dedicated. Much to Hollywood's surprise, people raced to see the controversial flick.While some accuse Gibson of revelling in the gore, with a little bit of thought his &quot;Passion&quot;'s point comes through. It's horrifying to imagine a person -- let alone an incarnate god -- going through such horrors. But when it is realized what the point of all that suffering was for, it becomes a work of beauty. The biggest problem would be that Gibson spent little time on the idea of Jesus being resurrected, which was the whole point.Jim Caviezel gives a stunning performance as Jesus Christ. Whether it's trying to pray through Satan's prattling or speaking to Mary and John from the cross, Caviezel brings every scene to life. Morgenstern is low-key wonderful as the sorrowful mother who has to watch her son killed by inches. And the beautiful Belucci is equally outstanding as the horrified Magdalene.Yes, it's in Aramaic and Latin. But if the language doesn't hold you back, the beauty of the script can shine through. And Gibson's direction is equally stunning, utilizing rapid camerawork and plenty of flashbacks to make Jesus's struggle even more poignant. At times -- the table scene -- it's more than slightly awkward. But it's easy to forget that by the next scene.It's a shock. It's a controversy. It's a one-of-a-kind film, based on a part of our culture that was underrated by Hollywood. It's Gibson's dark, bloody &quot;Passion of the Christ,&quot; and if you can watch something with some serious gore and straight-to-the-heart acting, then this is a must-see.	5.0	Inspiring &quot;Passion&quot;	2004-07-31	14	11	3

It wasn't just 3 beatings with a wip and they put him on the cross with 3 nails. This movie shows the real thing on how Jesus, the Christ really did for us. This movie directed by Mel Gibson, actually shows in depth the Passion of the Christ. Mel Gibson (Braveheart, Lethel Weapons) did what every other director in the world wouldn't do. I give him stars for his courage. He didn't care if people mocked him for this movie. He just did whta he was going to do. He even used his own money. Back to the movie. This movie was supposed to be rated PG-13. But they rated it R because they wanted to hurt Mel. But then putting that in the pape would just let more people want to see this movie. So everything they wanted to (meaning the rating company and the media) do backfired. This movie had no graphic violence.

People who aren't moved to tears are examples as to what our society has become(indifferent to others hurt and pain).This movie is meant to bring people together, and with the problems in society we have today, this movie should shed some light and comfort (at least for me it did, and hopefully will for others too)	5.0	Very Moving	2004-03-07	1	0	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1R2URG8OHNEDS	"Ed Mich ""Ed"""	"""The Passion of The Christ' has been clamed to be anti-Sementic. It has been claimed to include non-stop strong images of graphic violence, and it has been claimed not to show enough of the teachings of Jesus Christ. To me, all of those three things are not in the movie. The films shows nothing about blaming the Jews for the death to Christ, it showed enough violence for us to know how Jesus must how felt, and it showed enough of the teachings of Christ to show how good he was in his life. ""The Passion of The Christ"" was directed by Mel Gibson, and it is not only one of the best films of the year, but it is also one of the most provoking, thoughtfeld film of the year. It is about the final twelve hours of Jesus Christ's life. People claim that the film has too much violence, but if you think about, the final twelve hours of Christ's life was a very violent few hours. Mel Gibson is only trying to show us what Christ went through to save our sins. The movie has beautiful scenery, and I believe it was filmed in Rome. There wasn't that many sets, so most of the film was outdoors in Rome. The emotions were brilliant. The people watching this terrible thing happen to Jesus were either mortified, or glad.When the film starts, Jesus and his disciples just concluded the Last Supper. Jesus is in The Olive Garden, having a talk with Satan and trying to resist the offers of her. But he is betrayed by Judas, who tells Caiphas, and other Jesus priests, where he is located. They arrest him on sight, and Judas gets away with thirty silver pieces. Accused of religious crimes, Caiphas brings Jesus to the Roman Govener Pontius Pilate, because Caiphas wants him excuted, but only the Pilate is able to carry out such an order. Pilate is torn about what to do, but takes his wife's advice to spare Jesus. Pilate lets the people decide who should be freed, Jesus or a criminal. They let the criminal be free, and Pilate allows for a fair punishment for Jesus, but he doesn't want them to kill him. In front of the eyes of his horrified mother, Mary, and Mary Magdalene, they flog Jesus, letting him live, but with hundreds of cuts and scars.Jesus returns to Pilate, and they call for a crucifixion. Pilate does not want this, but he allows it, and Jesus suffers and suffers untill the point where he finally is dead.Jesus was nailed onto a cross, and the film goes through the stations of the cross, as he brings the huge wooden cross to a certain point, but he falls many times, and with the aid of anothor man, his suffering is still great, but a little more easy. The film has to show all of this, but they show enough to make you feel that you were actually there. They did not show the graphic image of every whip hitting his flesh, or they don't show the nails hitting the bone, but they show enough of it. It was really brillant how Mel Gibson was able to direct these people who were great in dipicting Jesus and Mary, and all the other people in the Bible. The story is a very sad one, but it is also very real. It is in Latin with English subtitles, so that made me really feel like I was there, because it was the language that they spoke at that time.""The Passion of The Christ"" should get many Oscar nominations next year including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Score, Best Adaptated Screenplay, and Best Director, among other awards. It is truely a great film, but it is not for everyone. I didn't think that it was as gory as everybody says it was, but I stress that it is one of the violet films that I have ever seen.

This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new ""recut"" version with I've come to call ""the PG-13 cut"" becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."	5.0	Definitive Difference	2007-02-14	23	18	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A35J4XGRWXVZ00	Edward	"From a purely literary viewpoint, the trial and execution of Christ is one of the most powerful stories ever told. But in Mel Gibson's new film ""The Passion of the Christ"" the fine drama is turned into coarse melodrama, as Gibson concentrates on flaying, blood-flying violence, the kind that appeals to the same people who flock to slasher movies. In fact, there may be those eagerly awaiting ""The Passion of the Christ 2: Peter Gets His"". Of course, there is violence in classic art. The Christian iconography of the Renaissance has canvas after canvas of whippings and nailings; but those images are static and stylized, not the graphic naturalism of motion pictures. Speaking of which: Gibson, in promoting the movie, has emphasized how realistic his picture is, an oblique put-down of the Biblical epics of he Fifties and Sixties. Granted, many of those productions were artificial and sometimes not even very entertaining. (At the risk of being hunted down by the NRA, I must admit I think ""Ben Hur"" is about 45 minutes too long.) But the fact is ""The Passion of the Christ"" possesses the same artificialities as those old films -- presenting, for instance, a tall and handsome Jesus. There is a very strong likelihood that the historical Jesus looked more like Woody Allen than Jeffrey Hunter, but Gibson's realism evidently didn't extend into casting. There are also some unfortunate lapses into what can kindly be called poetic license, including a sit-comish flashback where Mary is confused by a modern table constructed by her smart carpenter son. I'm giving the picture two stars, one for the cast's restrained ensemble acting and one for the superb photography of Caleb Deschanel. As for the movie itself, simplistic and sensationalistic, I don't think it's at all what Matthew, Mark, Luke and John had in mind."	2.0	Gibson's grievous fault	2004-02-26	24	6	18
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1IPE5950RGTXA	Edward H. Oh	"""The Passion of the Christ"" is meant for those who seek a new perspective on the story of Christ's suffering and sacrifice.  Mel Gibson's highly personal film treatment of Christ's last twelve hours is clearly targeted at Christians.  But, ""The Passion"" can hardly be described as a niche film, as almost every human being on earth knows at least the outlines of the story of Jesus of Nazareth.  Even atheists and Satanists will bring something to the table.Of course, not all will ultimately approve of Mel Gibson's artistic portrait of Christ's passion.  Still, this film will hopefully be a catalyst for a personal meditation on the crucifixion and resurrection.  No Christian with an open heart can walk out of this film unmoved.Those concerned about whether ""The Passion"" is truthful to what is the seminal event of Christianity- indeed, human history - need not be worried.  Yes, Mel Gibson presents what is his personal vision of Christ's last twelve hours, according to his reading of the Gospels.  He also practices a traditional form of Catholicism.  But, while the film is in many ways an expression of Gibson's Catholic faith (e.g. the character of Veronica on the road to Calvary who does not appear in the Bible), his interpretation of the Gospel text is strikingly true to the New Testament telling of Jesus' final hours.Gibson also exploits the techniques of cinema to provide the most visceral and lyrical depiction of Christ's suffering, crucifixion, and resurrection that I have ever seen.  Yet, he never treats the story, itself, in an exploitative fashion.  He handles the subject matter with reverence.The film does employ some dramatic devices that do not find root in the Gospel accounts.  One example is the depiction of the nature and manifestations of satanic evil.  For instance, the devil is seen trying to tempt Jesus into despair in Gethsemane (Luke 22:43 only mentions an angel comforting Christ), silently mocking Him during his scourging, and dogging His march to Calvary.  None of this is found in the Gospels.  Yet, is it farfetched to imagine that the same Satan who tempted Christ in the wilderness would also try to sabotage His mission in this most crucial of moments?  After all, the ultimate battle for mankind's collective soul was waged along the path from Gethsemane to Golgotha.Everyone needs to be aware that ""The Passion"" is almost unbearably violent.  But, that is because most of the movie is concerned with the barbaric and gruesome ritual of crucifixion, with its antecedent torture and degradation.  Moreover, Gibson's stated intent was to confront the viewer's complacency with the enormity of Christ's sacrifice and the unfathomable suffering caused by Original Sin - suffering Christ chose to bear in mankind's stead as the price of atonement.The now notorious scourging scene gives new meaning to the passage in Isaiah 52:14, which states: ""his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men....""  But, as authentic as the violence is, the film retains a sense of propriety by refusing to linger over the impact of each and every crack of the whip or thud of hammer against nail.There is welcomed use of flashbacks and cut-a-ways to other characters during the protracted scourging and crucifixion scenes.  Viewers are, thus, rescued from becoming mere voyeurs to cruelty.Critics who charge that ""The Passion"" subverts Christianity's essence betray their own misunderstanding of its crux.  Christ's message of love and tolerance is vital to living a good life, and the film does pay homage to it in flashback scenes of the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper; but to de-emphasize the meaning of the cross is to gut Christianity of its reason for existence.  Absent the promise of salvation, with its invitation to redemption through faith in the cross and all that its represents, Christianity becomes little more than a repository for moral platitudes with which no good atheist could disagree.Christ's suffering - physical and spiritual - is important because our sins made it necessary and unavoidable.  Ellen G. White, an early leader of the nascent Seventh-Day Adventist church, wrote that ""[i]t was not alone by dying on the cross that Christ accomplished His work of saving men.  The ignominy and suffering and humiliation was a part of His mission.""  That Christ willingly chose to take on that suffering and later die for our sake is the very heart of the greatest love story there is.In the end, the film's message can be found in its opening reference to Isaiah 53:5 which reads that Christ was ""wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities...and with his stripes we are healed.""  After watching ""The Passion of the Christ,"" that verse resonates in a way it never has before."	5.0	Passionate and Personal Masterpiece	2004-08-31	12	11	1

WE FELT SYMPATHY FOR JESUS BUT THE RELIGIOUS MESSAGE NEVER MADE IT THROUGH.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1FG3A3V5IAEG9	"E. Frampton ""Parandot"""	"Lost in all the debate, asinine shrill criticism, and self-righteous agenda pushing, one almost sees the movie as an afterthought.  I personally thought the movie was an over-the-top freak show.  A carnival of horrors and stupendous lack of imagination that almost bordered on plagarism, of course with Gibsons trademark ""realistic"" violence.  I like Gibson as a director, Braveheart is one of the best Hollywood Epics ever made, maybe even the best.  His deft touch on emotional chords was admirable, and made for a heartbreaking, tragic, and moving story.  Now, I know his intention here was to show the brutality, the plot was merely an afterthought, but still even the brutality was muted.  It just ISNT that violent, it wisely leaves most of the violence to the imagination, you see the barbed whip, you see its effects once, but most of it is just reaction shots and well placed sounds.  I'm going to go out on a limb and just say the crucifixation of christ is the end of a great story not the story itself, Jesus was a great man who met a brutal end, but it is not for me that the brutality makes it harrowing, it is for what he died.  But say what you want, it wasn't anti-semitic, people who want to see it will, and people who don't won't.  There is obnoxious overpraising and overcriticism on both sides.  The onnoxious Christian side says ""Hollywood"" doesn't like it, where Hollywood is a thinly veiled cynical replacement for Jews.  The obnoxious critising side says Gibson is an insane Holocaust denier anti-semitic and has a parking spot reserved in hell, hardly intelligent criticism.  So as it is impossible to see the movie without the hoopla, it is for me impossible to see the big deal, hardly a movie that moved me to a tear.  It was made for a specific audience and has no doubt been well received by that audience, but for me I was underwhelmed where I thought I would be left speechless.  So it goes."	2.0	Not worth the controversy	2004-03-20	29	7	22

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A23CDDJFVI1PE0	Eivom	In my opinion, this movie was very well directed and magnificantly acted. It was everything that I had expected.However, I know for a fact that this movie is not entertaining, and is definitly not for everyone. I myself, am a film lover, so I enjoy this movie as purely a cinematic piece. If you are looking for a fun movie to watch on a Saturday night though, unless you're the Osbournes, I wouldn't reccomend this.Another thing is that I believe everyone should see this movie at least once. Not neccessarily own it, but experience it just once. It doesn't matter what religion you are or what you have faith in, because this movie just shows the importance of HAVING faith, and what one man went through for his faith. I myself am an agnostic and was a little hesitant about seeing this film thinking it would promote Catholic beliefs. It doesn't, from what I saw it stayed true to what supposedly REALLY happened in the last hours of Jesus Christ. It does what it set out to do, and nothing more.On a final note, this movie is not anti-semetic. It does not suggest that Jews killed Jesus Christ. What it suggests is that EVERYONE killed Jesus Christ. He was paying for ALL of our sins.So to summarize, see it, but you most likely won't want to own it.	5.0	NOT FOR EVERYONE!	2004-08-09	27	23	4

I did not cry on the outside, but I was deeply touched by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for all of mankind.  The devil tried to temp him by saying the burden of man's sin was too heavy for just one man, but Jesus crushed the devil's snake's head (this image comes from Genesis when is says that the seed a man will crush the head of the serpent...neat, eh?).  The first scene shows Jesus agonizing in the garden because he is so afraid of His fate- He was born to die for the sins of man.  He says begs God to take this cup (His fate) away from Him if it is His will, but let God's will be done.  This is a beautiful message.  Could you do that?  Very touching.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1655SGPPUUCRP	Emily Todd	"""The Passion of the Christ"" is, without a doubt, the most moving film I have ever seen.  Never in my life have I been so affected by a film, involved with the characters, awed, and never have I cried so much.  Let it be known that this is coming from a person who does not attend church regularly.  I loved this film not because it was based on the Bible, but because it was a well-made film that had an amazing story of love, sacrifice, courage, and forgiveness.  The whole experience is very spiritual and very personal; there is something in this film that will strike a nerve with everyone who sees it.There are concepts in this film that apply to and can be understood by all of humanity, no matter what your race or creed may be.  Such as the tender mother-son relationship between Mary and Jesus, the pain a mother, Mary, feels when she sees her son suffer, or the concept of sacrificing yourself for a cause so great even you do not understand its full meaning.Aside from the emotional impact of ""The Passion"", this is a great film by ""technical"" standards.  The direction by Mel Gibson is superb and I am so impressed by his passion, drive, and determination, to get this film made.  The acting of James Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, Maia Moregenstern, and the rest of the cast does not even feel like acting, it feels real.  Caviezel, Bellucci, and Morgenstern become Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Mary.  It is easy for the viewer to forget that they are, in fact, watching a film and not witnessing the actual events themselves.  What a movie!  The score by John Debney and the cinematography by Caleb Deschanel are both stunningly beautiful and enhance the film's impact by enormous proportions.The anti-Semitic charges levied against this film are disturbing and upsetting.  In no way, shape, or form does ""The Passion"" promote anti-Semitism.  The only people to walk out of the theater with anti-Semitic feelings are people who already harbor those beliefs.As the story is set in a Jewish land, the people involved in the story are mainly Jewish, some good, some not.  As Roger Ebert said of the characters, ""Each one representing himself, none representing his religion.""  The actions of Jews in the mob, government, and those in the priesthood do not condemn an entire race.  This film condemns those people themselves and THEIR ACTIONS ALONE.  In addition, Jews amongst the crowd cry out against the torture, the Jewish Simon helps Jesus carry the cross, the Jewish Veronica wipes Jesus' face, Jews in the priesthood are against the crucifixion, and Jesus himself was a Jew.  Most importantly, the Jews did not kill Christ.  No one single person is responsible.  Jesus died by God's will for all of mankind's sins.  We are all responsible for the death of Jesus Christ."	5.0	"""Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do."""	2004-03-07	9	6	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3T2JX1MWYOCSE	"Emma de Soleil ""I moved to the UK for another..."	"It is hard to review a movie that is either loved or hated. Reading through the negative reviews most of it was degrading and rather common place bashing, yet some of the negative reviews raise some important points (And I'm not only referring to the gore here) and some of these do more good than a fanatic review. Yet, as a Christian myself, I know I cannot judge this movie without ever looking at my own belief. I was on the way of becoming an atheist and completely lost my faith in God when my mother got cancer and battled it for years. Yet she, the one who was really suffering, took great comfort from praying, reading the gospels and so on. It was this very disturbing experience (My mother's painful death) that made me think. And then I heard about this upcoming movie... The rest is history.Well, for starters, Jesus HAS lived on this earth and was crucified as several Roman historians and more prove. I encourage everyone to watch the BBC Production of ""Jesus from Nazareth"" for an IMHO historical and rather rational view on the most loved or hated man that ever lived. An great addition would also be the German ""2000 Jahre Christentum"" which can be bought on Amazon.de. Now what happened after Golgotha is up to what you believe or not. But I would never dare to ridicule someone for believing in whatever he chooses because faith is something very personal. That is why reviews that attack those who believe in Christ disturbed me more than the movie. If logic rules the world: Why would those sarcastic atheists even bother to watch a movie on a person they do not respect?As for Antisemitism, I saw none of it. The Romans were portrayed as bloodhounds, not the Jews. And remember, Jesus himself was a Jew. And just because some weren't good people doesn't condemn an entire people, I believe that if we're as smart as some reviewers who cried ""Antisemitism!"" proclaim we are, we should be past that. There are not so good Americans, Austrians, Australians, Chinese as well as not so good Jews. We're all fallible, aren't we? Just as not all the Germans were not has horrific as movies like ""Schindler's List"" or ""Hasenjagd"" portrayed the really evil ones, not ALL the Jews were good or bad either. There are black sheep everywhere. Why does something that common place even have to be explained? The whole movie wouldn't work if ALL the Jews had wanted Jesus to live, just as ""Schindler's List"" wouldn't work if ALL the Germans had opposed Hitler's scheme. (I'm not comparing the holocaust to Jesus' Passion, I'm merely trying to explain why it wouldn't be plausible in another way) What am I saying? Don't regard a movie just as either Black or White. This movie, with all its crude gore, doesn't white-wash anything as much as it doesn't blacken history. It is realistic, painful to watch and made me throw up more than once.It's not entertainment but a reminder of what has been and what has been played down in most versions on Christ's life, esp. ""King of Kings"" and ""The Greatest Story ever told"". An example of ""playing down"" would be how Caesar's murder has been put on film numerous times. Most of these neither follow the historian's GORY descriptions nor do they dare to show what is described in all its gruesome details. The closest version to the actual event as described is the mini-series with Jeremy Sisto as Caesar but even that one is ""easy on the eyes"". Now ""The Passion"" shows that Jesus didn't die as ""beautifully"" as the famous paintings made us think he did. It was gruesome, gory, inhuman, sweaty, dirty, swollen, bloody, ripped... you name it.As for the movie's power: The score alone is enough to go straight to the heart. There are several gems of masterful directing in this movie that I won't ever forget. (Such as the ""Ecce homo!"") Which brings me to the subject of Mel Gibson: Neither the sad fact that Mel's father denies the holocaust (A belief Mel does NOT share and shouldn't be condemned for) nor his personal life or opinions on women's rights or whatever should influence your judgement. What did one NEGATIVE reviewer ask for? An IMPARTIAL view.Now would I ever watch this movie again? No. I cannot bear it. THe experience is unlike any other. It rips you apart, each lash has the power of a stabbing dagger. The gruesome details are too much to stomach. But I'm glad I had the courage to watch it. I'm glad for it as a Christian for this vivid presentation of HIS suffering I have realised that whatever makes me feel ""blue"" is nothing compared to real suffering. Codemn my belief all you like but I cannot disregard this film and its influence in a positive way. HIS message was love. And atheist or Christian, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. This movie's power and controversy cannot be denied, it already has a lot more reviews than classics like ""Gone With The Wind"". Like many other things it brings out the very best or the worst in everyone."	5.0	Powerful, disturbing, controversial	2004-12-14	11	5	6

Obviously, they failed miserably, and Mel Gibson's movie is a well-deserved enormous success.This movie is a masterpiece. As a Christian, for me the movie was a religious experience. Yes, it's graphic, yes, it's painful to watch. But if we had been with Jesus when He had been on earth, it is what we would have experienced firsthand. We are reminded that Jesus came for us, that He was betrayed by those closest to Him, that He experienced what we experience, and for that reason He always understands what we are going through and is always there for us.If you are not a Christian already, hopefully this movie will open your heart to Jesus. If you are already a Christian, this movie will make you feel closer to Jesus and stronger in your faith.Thank you so much, Mel Gibson, for making this movie for us all.	5.0	John 3:16	2004-04-25	9	5	4

I feel the positive reviews on this movie are motivated by a senseless cuopling of peoples' overzealous religious faith.  In this case, faith has made these people turn a blind eye to the film's CONTENT.  For Pete's sake-- it's nothing more than a long picture of torture.  There's no philosophy behind it, no exposition, no DEPTH.  It dully shows us a series of tortures to one guy, and utterly fails to make us feel that the one guy is in any way more worthy a soul than -- say-- a madman on a streetcorner.This is a shallow retelling, with accent on the blood, of the last tortures of a religious figure.If you're hoping to gain insight into Christian philosophy, or find meaning, or even a poignant musing about the events, you'll be sadly disappointed.This movie is like a plastic Santa Claus mannequin:  Based on an important pre-sold character & storyline, but merely hollow plastic.

This is not propoganda.  Christ was condemned by the jews . . .FACT!  The criticism about the violence is equally insidious.  Sorry all of you people who believe that your criticism is valid and intelligent, but that is how it was 2000 years ago.  Ever seen the OTHER films on Jesus?  I don't care if it's made for TV or in a theatre.  The films are bland and emotionless.  The scourging in these films are also inaccurate.Make no mistake, the violence is excruciating to watch.  You will turn your head many times and you will need tissue.  Jim Caviezel's portrail of Jesus is human and real.  No other actor in film/TV has ever been able to portray Christ as a man NOT as a googly-eyed zombie with no personality or charisma.I gave this film 5 stars for it's brilliant cinenatography and storytelling.  However, this is a spiritual experience NOT a moviegoing one.  You will leave the theatre drained emotionally.  You will also be glad you watched it.  Hey, if Jesus died for our sins and in doing so endured hours of torture and unbearable pain, the least believers could do is to witness this film and understand what he went through.Yeah, Gibson's film has it's inaccuracies, but that's minor criticism compared to the cinematic beauty of this film.	5.0	A Spiritual Experience	2004-03-25	2	1	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1IL603JSIKSAU	Eric	I found this to be the best attempt of placing the story of Christ during his last steps.I was moved by the deep thought behind the images and felt as if Gibson was pulling My own feelings about The Passion right out.I thought that he did a great job with the look of Jesus and the way he went about bringing his own thoughts through along with what has been told to us about this event.I did not see any thing that was not needed to make this as good as it was.Jesus was treated in this way and I feel it is about time some one told it as it was.I also found Myself feeling as if My own personal Jesus was looking back at me all through the film.This film was never meant to be a history of Christ picture and should not be viewed as such.Any one who bothered to read why it was made or who understands the art of making this a work of art for your enjoyment,can clearly see that this is the best attempt at reminding you of Christ love and will to Winn the fight for you.I thought the conflict between Satan and Christ was well done and really put a new look to the eniter story.A very good and well done work of art ,which brought back to mind My personal Jesus. Any one who went to see this just to put it down...well that is your great loss,not mine.I think it will be the new icon even of the time.Eric	5.0	The best of it's kind.	2004-03-01	1	1	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A267JIMMNZHFWG	Eric Weaver	"""The Passion"" has numerous beautiful moments, most of which come in the opening minutes in the garden.  The Virgin Mother is wonderfully portrayed, as is her sinister double, Satan, and while Caviezel has little to do in the film other than be beaten, his few moments of genuine acting are powerful.  However, Gibson makes numerous false steps: overuse of slow motion, absurd ""demonic visions"" experienced by Judas, and short flashbacks that are left without contextualization and are meaningless to those outside of the Christian tradition.  It is true that the film has an unfortunate anti-Semitic subtext (the Pharisees are presented with about as much sympathy and subtly as comic book villains).  The true crime, however, is the almost Saint-like treatment of Pontius Pilate, who was in reality a brutal dictator who was all too happy to murder Jesus.  The final matter, that of the graphic violence, is more a matter of personal theology than of film criticism.  If you believe in salvation through faith in the sacrifice made by Jesus for the benefit of mankind, you might have a conceptual framework with which to interpret the violence positively.  If, on the other hand, you believe Jesus' message to be one of salvation through action (such providing resources to the poor, unconditional love, and pacifism) then the violence will likely seem perverted and senseless, not at all unlike other unfortunate films such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" that thrive on humanity's carnal hunger to see blood spilled."	3.0	Far from a masterpiece, regardless of your beliefs	2004-03-27	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2F1P10GGZ7K2T	Erik1988	"I've ignored this movie for the last two years due to the amount of good and bad publicity/discussion around it. It just didn't interest me at the time.So here I am in the library and see it on the shelf and I decide to pick it up and watch it as a filler for when my Netflix rentals are delayed for whatever reason.I'm still speechless as this thought-provking movie left me with an appreciation for what the Lord our Christ did for us. The point of the movie is in the title of the movie: The point of Christ's life was to die for mankind and rise again and thus fulfill the plan of God the Father as laid out in the Scriptures.The means, his beating and crucifixon, was Christ's passion as a diety wanting to demonstrate an unbound love for his creation, even when his human side (our human side) desired to satisfy and protect the self instead.The passion is so well portrayed in this movie that I'm left with a deep awe as to what is such a well known ""story"" and left with the implications of what if it is all true? What if Christ is the true God who came as a man to die and rise again to give us a choice. . .to give us the opporutnity to take our cruel, self-serving ways and now have an avenue to approach a God that is without blemish?What if I choose to grasp the fact that the story of the crucifiction is much more than a historical account of an innocent man receiving the death penalty? What if I truely understand that though things aren't always obvious or visible (as demonstrated with the Satan and demon scenes of the movie) that Jesus was more than a man, that more was at stake in the battle between Good vs. Evil and that fulfilling a destiny at the cost of self is the greatest act of love, mercy, heroism and everything noble that we should all strive to be more like?To watch such a well directed and well acted movie that has the focus of changing lives can't but leave me dumbstruck. For anyone to watch this movie and not think twice or three times about the implications of their actions, the implications of their choices on their eternal future would only demonstrate denial and/or shallowness of character.I don't expect everyone to ""get it"". This is a spiritual subject matter and for the same reason two people can read a book and one focus on the grammar and the other on the spirit/theme of the story shows that we all approach things through a different filter. But that in no way should detract from the person who doesn't ""get it"" to seek further, and try to understand deeper and question more.I'm so glad I watched this and can see it being a regular reminder as to what was sacrificed for me as blemished being and what is available to all if we choose to believe in the Passion of the Christ and the message of eternal life that awaits all those who embrace this passion.There are those movies we watch and love because they make us laugh.There are those movies we watch and love because we relate or think the action cool.Then there are movies like this that we watch and maybe have to grow to love but are left with something more than 2hrs of entertainment. We are left with challenge to reflect.This is a must own movie!!"	5.0	for those trying to understanding something deeper than themselves	2006-03-02	25	16	9

The film would have been so much better served to have used excerpts from the St. Matthew and/or St. John Passion by Bach.  Debney's score is good at best, but for a film with such emotional weight, it certainly could have been much, much, much more.  Then again, people probably don't care that much about the music.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AOSA6PYEB2HXZ	Esther Law	I was hesitant to watch the movie because of all the reports I had heard about the level of violence.  However, my curiosity finally won out and when my neighbour got the DVD, I simply had to watch it.I loved it!  I was absorbed in the movie from the very start and it never let go.  It was intense.Yes there was violence, and yes Gibson didn't shield us one bit from the enormity of it.  It is graphic and in your face, however it is NOT gratuitious violence.  It was simply a portrayal of what actually happened (well, if you believe in the bible).  Of course, I still had to cover my eyes at some points.  (Interestingly, some movie critics who complained about the level of violence in this movie are perfectly happy with the senseless blood and gore of Hollywood flicks.  Go figure.)I found the pacing fantastic.  The use of the languages of the day actually helped the authenticity of the movie.  I think that was an excellent decision by Gibson.  The cinematography was breathtaking.  The portrayal of the Devil sent shivers down my spine.  The final scene with the Devil and the final scene of the movie were absolutely perfect.  I won't say more because I simply can't give that away.The movie followed Jesus only during those last hours of his life from the Garden of Gethsemene to the tomb.  Sprinkled throughout were flashbacks that did a fantastic job of linking Jesus' life and teachings to his crucifixtion.  One could almost see his apostles watching the events, remembering what Jesus had said, and experiencing a mini-revelation, finally unerstanding what Jesus meant.Another thing I loved about the movie was the excellent use of eye contact.  So much was said without words.  Like the rest of this movie, it was powerful.Also, those who have done some research into the Passion will realize that Gibson drew from a variety of sources to flesh out the biblical story.  Writings and from various Saints were used.  There is so much symbolism and so much depth to the movie.  As I said, fantastic.Finally, all the &quot;bit characters&quot; in this story were fleshed out with their own personalities, constraints, hopes, and viewpoints.  The Romans were not all carbon copies of each other.  Nor were the Jews.  And along the way, we saw characters touched and moved by the events taking place.Definitely a movie to see, and absolutely a movie to talk about afterwards.  All in all, an excellent movie that made the last hours of Jesus' life more real.	5.0	well researched and executed portrayal of Jesus' final hours	2004-10-13	0	0	0

It is not a life of Christ or an explanation of Jesus's ministry. It is a medieval passion play toned down and put on film. The violence is appalling but not nearly as bloody and humiliating as a real crucifixion. For some insight into that, see Thomas Cahill's ""Desire of the Everlastng Hills"".Using the ancient languages was interesting, but done with a medieval perspective. It is more likely that the Romansconversed with the Jews in Greek rather than Latin, since Greek was the common tongue of the eastern Mediterranean at that time.This picture makes its point well, but there is quite a bit of non-gospel tradition and outright speculation mixed in."	4.0	A Passion play put on screen	2004-08-13	13	6	7

Opps, was that politicly incorrect? Well it was also TRUTH (somthing becomming less and less popular in today's culture).Now Jesus CHOOSE to die, for ALL of us, jews included. But, it was the jews that had Jesus taken and killed. Yes the Romans played a part in this, but it would have happened anyway.Speaking of the Romans, that brings up the one flaw in the movie. The Roman soliers. In the movie, they were an unruly lot that constatly disobeyed orders, and were drunken. That's not at all how it would have been. Romans were reknown for their extreme disipline, and orderly conduct (along with profiecency in killing). If those soldiers had flogged Jesus longer than they were supposed to in real life, it would have been thier heads!The main point- before you start making strong accusations, think about for half a second!	5.0	I can only read so much idiocy...	2004-03-17	34	8	26
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1S31XLRRB11US	F. Adcock	"After all the hype surrounding this film, I was a bit surprised to find that the violence pictured was less than expected.  I was sure ""The Passion of the Christ"" would employ sequences showing blood and body parts flying in all directions - and in slow-motion.  I saw worse violence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and in those ""Alien"" movies.  It's obvious that most Christians find this movie rather graphic, and incredibly moving, because this violence is being done to Jesus.  True, no other film has shown Jesus's execution with this much attention to ""detail"".  But I was far more moved by Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"", which shows why many Jews and the High Priest hated Jesus so, making the execution sequence incredibly powerful.The movie is inaccurate as to history and the Bible, and is Mel's own vision as to the events.  I do give high marks for the acting, the music, and the camera work.  In fact, the look of the entire film is most beautiful (too bad the subject matter couldn't have been more beautiful).Mel is, without question, aiming his magnum opus at the Christian public, who have been taught the story from birth.  If Mel had presented more of the tale leading up to the trial, I would have been happier.  Otherwise, all I see is a movie about a man being tortured and executed.I agree with film critic Richard Roeper, that this film doesn't stand the ""repeated viewing"" test.  If watching a man being crucified is your thing, try renting it first."	2.0	The Gospel According to Mel	2004-09-04	15	8	7

As a pastor, my heart was beating more from the beginning of the movie with the scene in the Garden of Gethsamane. I found the movie to be very moving on a deeply spiritual experience, not because I enjoyed see Jesus suffering so much, but that it was just incredible to see the amount of suffering a person could endure. In this case, it was because God loves us so much he gave us His Son. I find this movie to be the best description of the passion of Jesus Christ. If you were to read the Bible, you would see why the movie is so realistic. The Bible describes Jesus suffering to the point of death. I thank Mr. Gibson for daring to make this movie. I hope other people will be able to have a deeply spiritual experience from watching this movie.	5.0	Spiritually Moving	2004-06-14	5	5	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AK17ELWV8SMJM	"felicitaz ""felicitaz"""	"When I first heard about this film in production, I assumed that it was going to be yet another Hollywood-type product, following the cliched Hollywood style. In fact, the only reason I went to see it was because the dialogue would be in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin. I wanted to hear what Jesus' words sounded like in Aramaic.Was I surprised! From the very start, this film was different. I'm a Christian, so I have a bias toward the subject. However, I wasn't expecting the high level of artistry in its treatment, in its filming, lighting, storytelling, and imagery. It felt like a foreign film--that is, sophisticated and daring. This is NOT sword-and-sandal spectacle.From the heavy atmosphere of the Garden of Gethsemane, with its thick mist in blue moonlight, to the Mediterranean light of stone courtyards, and eerie overcast sky above Golgotha, Gibson creates an ancient Jerusalem that seems to surround the viewer. I felt a chill in the garden, almost as if I were there, wrapped in the mist. From here forward, one is pulled along, between moments of frank, intense dialogue to moments of grand mal-dreamlike violence (the arrest of Jesus in the garden) or softness (Jesus' affectionate banter with his mother). The movie throws one off balance, shattering expectations, leaving the viewer disoriented. It was a story I knew well, but Gibson somehow made it new and surprising.There is terrible violence in this film, and there are reasons why people may object to it--especially the scene of Jesus' scourging at the hands of Pilate's soldiers. Usually films leave this sort of thing to the imagination. However, I understand Gibson's decision to dwell so graphically on this stage of the Passion. You can dismiss suffering you don't see. But when it's pushed into your face, you have to face it. I had not realized what ""scourging"" meant until I saw this scene, and it gave me a painful shock of realization that I and my sin were responsible. Judging from the sound of soft sobbing from other parts of the theater, others had the same flash of realization.This film could have been mawkish, trite, tepid, politically correct. It could have ridden on the strength of popular ideology, and not bothered with edgy camerawork, editing, lighting, setting, casting, imagery. It could have been content to preach, and not worried about beauty. It could have stuck to the letter of the Scriptures, and avoided poetry and imagination. But the ""Passion"" is Outsider Art on a grand scale. It's touching because it's sincere--the expression of an artist speaking from the depth of his heart to touch the audience in the depths of theirs."	5.0	Outsider art	2006-09-07	22	16	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3JKQTZQZBHBHA	"filmz ""Lisa"""	What a complete disappointment. I am actually shocked that so many people made such a big deal over this film. This film is made for people who beleive Jesus is their lord and savior. Gibson is not a historian, nor is he an authority on the life of Jesus Christ. This is his own biased, and very personal twist on possible historical events. He places incredible emphasis on the Jews as being the instigators of Jesus's death-and the Romans just following orders. I would not say this film is blatantly anti-semitic; however, because so many people  are ignorant and gullible-they are bound to draw the conclusion that Jews are responsible for his death-thus perpetuating hatred against Jews. Anyone who cannot see that-is blind. People are stupid enough to believe that life was created in 7 days-will just about believe anything.As far as the DVD itself-it was awful. The subtitles were non-existant throughout the latter half of the film-and only flickered on occasion so I had no idea what was being said. I don't know if it was the copy I rented-or if all of the DVD's are defective like that.Even with the lack of subtitles-this film only portrayed his crucifixion-but offered no insight. I thought it failed miserably, and the actor who played Jesus looks like every Christian, White Jesus.

I finally did this past Easter season... Good Friday to be precise.Those of the Roman Catholic faith would be familiar with the ""sorrowful mysteries""...specifically the agony in the garden, scourging at the pillar, crowning with thorns, carrying of the cross and the crucifixion.  It's one thing to imagine them and yet another to witness them in gruesome detail - as presented in this movie.My wife and I reflected on the movie afterward and she found it's graphic intensity to be a bit much.  It was hard to watch.  That's what I found particulary poignant.  Witnessing it in gorey detail on screen is one thing.  Imagine actually being there for real.  You can see why St. Peter denied Christ three times... wouldn't you?Some non-Catholics don't understand the special role Mary has in our faith.  Maybe it's lost on some but to me, her very significance in the eyes of God, and the Catholic tradition is underscored in this movie.In any event, if you've ever wondered what ""scourging at the pillar"" really means or shrugged off the significance of Jesus's life, death and resurrection, this movie will provide some prospective.I'd put it in the same category as ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Not a movie I'd care to watch over and over but one that should certainly be watched when the topic of reducing Veterans rights is presented.This movie should be seen by those who struggle with their own crosses and need a booster shot in their faith."	5.0	Puts things in perspective to be sure	2008-03-27	5	3	2

More awe-inspiring than the Sistine Chapel. Worthy to stand beside The Confessions of St. Augustine in terms of pure evangelical power. Truth be told, perhaps no Christian apologist since Apostolic times has ever touched the hearts of as many people as Mel Gibson has with this film.Works of such depth and beauty necessarily rile strong emotions. Few believing Christians will be able to view this film and not weep. Few vehement atheists will fail to recognize the incredible persuasive power of the film and rail against it in the most extreme terms. Few agnostics will be able to view the film and not take a position one way or the other.As a student of Greco/Roman history and culture, I found the film's use of archaic languages utterly spellbinding. As a devout Catholic, I was touched to the core by the film's accurate portrayal of the brutalization and crucifixion of Jesus. I have seen dozens of religious epics, but The Passion of the Christ blows them all away. It sets a new standard for the genre which Hollywood will have a hard time reaching.	5.0	Greatest Christian evangelist in 1900 years = Mel Gibson?	2004-09-30	9	7	2

As any good, devout, patriotic christian knows from reading the sacred dead sea scrolls, Jesus lived to be an old man with many children and his beloved Queen Mary magdaline.  Mel Gibson, or Mad Gibson, has clearly visited his cocaine dealer one too many times lately to dream up this convoluted, blood-bath of Caligula-styled paranoia in an extreme attempt to banish everyone elese's money into to his wallet.  By the way, people who have been whipped this many times generally don't still have skin on their backs.  A much more accurate portrayal of Jesus and God in the lives of people in modern times would be the powerfully moving The Order.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3533JJKYTM7EE	fpr	"Several reviewers have accurately pointed out several historical inaccuracies in this bad Mel Gibson depiction of the passion.  However, please allow me to point out one more.Several years ago, I went to a Jesuit university in the Midwest.  There, I was befriended by one of the Jesuit Theology instructors.  And he was a good one!  With several published books and papers under his belt, he still speaks at conferences on the subject of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice - his death.  In 1985 to 1986, I helped this brilliant man read through and organize literally hundreds of documents on the subject of crucifixion.  A few years later, the fruit of both of our labors was published in several periodicals and textbooks.In this impressive work, my friend and teacher wrote that ""...there has never been any definitive link between flogging and crucifixion"".  Crucifixion was met to be demoralizing and painful, but above all, SLOW.  The Romans generally avoided anything that would speed the death process along.  The fact that close to half of Gibson's movie depicts Romans ripping pieces of Jesus' skin away compliments of a few devices of torture just does not make sense.  True, Pilot could have intended flogging to be Jesus' ONLY punishment, but that is not highly likely.  What Gibson refuses to believe (or at least depict in this film), is that the Jews were not the only group who wanted Jesus to die.  Pilot and the Romans were just as guilty of that.  For Pilot to have his men beat Jesus half to death then free him to rebel rouse again was just not how the Romans operated!  In those days, if you were a fomenter of any kind of disturbance in Roman controlled lands, you were put to death.  Period.Also, affixing the victim to the cross by nailing was not all that common.  Spikes through the wrists and feet could result in a quick death due to blood loss, and quick death was not the objective of a crucifixion.  Often crucifixion victims hung on the cross for days, and this was just fine with the Romans.  Though most eventually died of suffocation, some died of starvation or heart attack resulting from shock.Gibson ignores these facts seemingly to guilt trip the viewer into believing what he believes.

But Mel didn't show all the suffering that Jesus had to withstand for us.  Just a small thing, but it kinda upset my family that it was not depicted in the film, the ripping out of Jesus's beard.  OUCH!!!  No I'm not a Bible scholar, and I definitely don't know the Bible cover to cover (shame on me) but I would have really apprieciated a more accurate depiction of the suffering that Jesus beared for us for love's sake.  To know that someone loved me enough to 'take it for me' in that manner is most heart wrenching.My daughter and I told each other, if the salvation of the world depended on us, and we had to go through what Jesus did, for us, then the world would be going to Hell in a hand basket.	4.0	Mel didn't show all that was done to Jesus...	2004-06-18	7	0	7

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1VU8D2148AKAG	Francisco Pizarro	"In the last 20 years, which is the time I have followed the film industry closely, no other film has been more polarizing than Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. People either find this film a masterpiece or completely hate it and dismiss it as an ultra-violent snuff film with no merit. It seems that people's opinions are based on where they stand religously and I can certainly understand that. So I'm not going to add fuel to the fire. I'm simply going to talk about the technical merits of the film and the historical aspects that are covered in this movie. Also I will talk about the transfer to Blu-Ray since this is the film's debut in High Definition.The Passion is without a doubt, a showcase of Mel Gibson's filmaking know-how. He has certainly mastered the art of epic filmaking. Every frame, every scene, is beautifuly concieved. The pacing is pretty flawless and given the fact that the film is mostly spoken in a dead language, it is incredibly easy to follow and understand. A lot of hype surrounded the fact that the film would be done in the now defunct toungue as well as latin but in the end it doesn't matter. This is a visual feast. The subtitles simply confirm that you are understanding the scene at hand. In this film, the visuals and the incrdible score do most of the talking.Historically, the film is pretty accurate. I'm not talking about the Biblical aspects of the film (in that respect, some liberties were taken regarding what is written in the gospels). Whether you believe in the Bible or not is a very personal thing. I'm talking about how the time of 30 AD is portrayed and how the romans dealt with prisioners in that time. The rawness and brutality of the era is very well captured. Whether we can bear watching or not, whether we believe it is too violent for film or not, the fact is that this is how the romans tortured and crucified prisioners in the first century AD. It is brutal and raw. Whether showing that has any cinematic merit, I leave to the viewer.When first popping this BD on my player I got worried. The opening scene in the garden of Getsemani is, by HD standards, horrible. I don't know if it was the ""day for night"" effect that was used or the colors or what but this scene simply did not transfer well to HD. It is very grainy, lacks sharpness and the colors are subdued. I was about to think I had wasted my money when the scene ended and then all changed. After we leave the Garden and head to the other scenes in the film, the film comes to life in HD. Rich, beautiful colors, awsome blacks and great contrast. The textures come out clean and clear right down to the fabric in clothing. The slow-motion scenes (and there are a lot of them in this film)come to life on Blu-Ray. Overall an awsome transfer and one that showcases what High Definition is all about.Very Hard to review this film but if you pass by the religious controversy that surrounds this film, there is a lot here for the fan of filmaking and now for the fan of HD."	4.0	Amazing Film and Transfer	2009-08-09	5	4	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AYUQRYH51OHXU	FreddyV	His political philosophy aside, Mel Gibson is a gifted man.  He's done good work in the past.  Braveheart was pretty good but this movie, I'm sorry to say, was way overrated.  I think the content itself is powerful.  It's a harrowing, unforgetable experience.  Others here might disagree with me but I think that extending the scene where Jesus Christ was tortured is unnecessary.  Yes, show how it happened but don't dwell on it so deeply to the point that this becomes the centerpiece of the movie.  As a Catholic, I understand why this was here, I understand the religious context, but objectively speaking I cannot find any other reason to think that this scene warranted so much of the movie's time.  It gives the entire film a sense of being overrated.  Imagine if this had been a movie about some other guy, a regular John Doe being tortured and that a good chunk of the movie centered on his being beaten to a bloody pulp.  The movie would tank and get an average of two stars here on amazon.  If anyone wants to buy this product, it's your choice.  I viewed it once and that was enough for me.  If I were to buy it, that means that I'm willing to watch an extended torture scene of Jesus Christ more than once.  That's just too much for me.  I'm sorry.	2.0	Overrated	2005-05-21	21	13	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"This has to be the most intelligently made film about Jesus Christ ever.  Instead of just putting the words of the gospel to be simply acted out Gibson has managed to also put across the intended message behind the words to the viewer as well.  Films of Christ in the past seemed to be shallow and lacking any substance as they seemed to be afraid to go beyond just the superficial reading of the material.  This film is violent and uncompromising because it tells it as it is; crucifixion never was a cake walk and the Romans were extremely brutal conquerors.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual episode was a whole lot more violent than was depicted.  Gibson clearly intended to make it clear that the Passion of Christ was an incredible act of love of God for mankind.  A scene from the film in a flashback when Jesus says that no greater love exists than for a man to lay down his life for the sake of another emphasises this point.  To see the extent of the suffering and painful, humiliating death of an innocent for the sake of those that even hate him is what makes this film so powerfully moving and as a result, this film successfully brings across the true meaning of the word of God to the audience.Christians feeling down or going through a dry spell should stop feeling sorry for themselves and put this dvd on to quickly remove any doubt whatsoever that their God loves them and has given everything, including himself, so that they can be truly free.  Now all we have to do is to exercise our free will wisely; the choice is ours.  The only part that left me a little disappointed is the continuing error of wrongly depicting Mary Magdalene as the sinful woman who was accused of adultery.  If there is a patron saint of mistaken identity or of people who have been framed then Mary Magdalene should be it!  Nowhere in the bible does it say that she is the sinful woman or even the one who bathes Jesus' feet with her tears; all that's said is that she had 7 demons cast out from her.  Hence the scenes of Mary of Magdala's flashbacks took away a bit of the film's impact for me.  Having readThe Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christwhich by the way is a must read if you want a proper accompanying book of the film, I was very pleased to see how accurately this film was in depicting one of the source material from which this film is based.I sincerely hope that this is not Mel Gibson's last attempt at a film based upon the bible and if he does say the Book of Maccabees, we'll get a chance to see how the whole Pharisee sect got it's origins and how based upon this traumatic period of Jewish history the pendulum of extremism swings so radically to the opposite side to the point that it led to the total intolerance and hence the passion of Christ as depicted in this film.  In zealously trying to reclaim ""orthodoxy"" and to move closer to God after the Hellenisation period of Ephiphanes, this new order arose to ironically achieve the opposite by the time of Jesus.  A film based upon the Acts of the Apostles would also be appreciated perhaps based upon Paul's journeys.  There is nothing anti-Jewish about this film given that Jesus and his apostles themselves were Jews; if anything this film is anti-evil, anti-violence and anti-falsehood showing us that peace, love and tolerance is infinitely more preferable.  Mel Gibson proves that he knows how to make movies based upon the intent behind the words of scripture.The picture and sound quality especially in DTS surround format is excellent making this dvd standard format an excellent addition to your video library.  Required regular watching for all adult Christians and comes very highly recommended!Updated: 16 April 2012As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I've appended this update here: the Blu-Ray version of the Definitive Edition of this film is a vast improvement over the standard dvd and is now the optimal version of this film on disc.  The picture quality and especially the sound quality has been improved enough to warrant an upgrade from the standard dvd.  There are now two versions of the film with a slightly shorter and less violent version included as well as the full-length original.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A281P8VOXZCW8T	Freedom Slave	"1 Corinthians 1:18 - For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.This movie vividly depicts how Jesus took our sins upon Himself.  He bore the punishment that we all deserve.  He did this because He loves every one of us.  Jesus (who is God) lived a life completely without sin, and served as the perfect sacrifice in order to cancel our debt of sin.  God created us with free will.  While we are all held responsible for our choices, God, in His Perfect love and fairness, held Himself accountable for our ability to act against His will.  In John 15:13, Jesus says: ""Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.""  In Romans 5:8, the apostle Paul explains: ""But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.""  What Mel Gibson was trying to capture in this movie is a chilling representation of what our God was willing to endure to make the relationship with humanity right again.  All that He asks for in return is faith and repentance.  We do not deserve such uncommon grace from the One whom we show contempt toward each time we sin.  Salvation is a free gift to all who are willing to accept Christ, and His sacrifice on the cross.  We cannot earn this gift.  This is why it is called GRACE.  A God who was willing to suffer humiliation and an excruciating death, in order to make eternal life with Him possible for everyone, is simply AMAZING!  If you choose to reject this God, who loves you so much, it is your God-given choice to do just that.  God loves you enough to let you make your own decisions.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1R6KGK8TRJAGV	"Free Thinker ""Amazon made me remove my blog s..."	"The Passion of the Christ fulfills its purpose: to display the events described in the Gospels during the last hours of Jesus' earthly life.  It does so by combining eerie, surreal effects, such as Satan's appearances, with honest depictions of what the Gospels say he endured.  The historical accuracy, visual effects and overall atmosphere are beyond excellent.  This is truly a magnificent effort.I am pleased to see that people of varying ideological stripes have seen and enjoyed this film.  As for the detractors, they seem to fall into two categories: (1.) incoherent ramblings from some who prove that atheists are not intellectually superior to Christians; and (2.) others who were ""offended"" by the violence.As a mainstream Episcopalian who majored in biblical studies, I have seen no other movie on this subject that has so accurately conveyed the brutality of the Roman Empire or the cheapness with which life was regarded in the ancient world.  The graphic violence we find so distasteful was just another day in the Empire 2,000 years ago.  There is no ""sin"" in graphically communicating this truth to modern audiences.One wonders if these detractors would be so critical of a film that portrayed another event, say, the tragic murder of Matthew Shepherd by homicidal monsters, in all its savagery.  It's likely they would hail the ""courage"" of the directors in doing so.  Sadly, their hypocrisy shows for all to see.In the end I must applaud this film, and agree with Pope John Paul II, who said after seeing it ""it is as it was.""

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3A6ZHKZ8SKV1U	"Friendly Neighbor ""Fair Buyer"""	This movie made me feel again. For so long I was starting to lose some faith in humanity - nearly falling into a mini-depression. Seems like Christmas last year was full of commercialism and idiots who didn't give a heck about the meaning. I was beginning to seclude myself away from the public because I was losing faith in them. Then about three weeks before Easter, my husband and I took the big leap into seeing this &quot;graphic, gory, and conteroversal&quot; movie that Mel Gibson directed. I sat there through the movie and did not even breathe. It was all clear to me. Jesus was the most selfless &quot;man&quot; that ever existed on the face of this planet. I began feeling again sitting right there crying and turning my head when I couldn't bear anymore, then looking again when I could make myself. Yes, it is very difficult to watch. But it was neccessary to watch.Take in account, how many others it effected. Shortly after the movie was released, news was covering people left and right who were turning there lives over to The Lord. In one account, a man had killed his wife and staged it as a suicide: Thirty years later, after watching the Passion, he walks into a police station and turns himself in. Also, there was a teenager who was planning on copying Columbine buy bringing guns to school and shooting his classmates. The day after seeing Mel Gibson's film, he turned himself in and turned over all of his deadly weapons.Say what you will, some with little faith. But the truth is that it touched people more that any other film ever has. Why? Becuase Mel Gibson took a leap at touching the most selfless, most loving, most giving man there ever was. My Lord and Savior who gave me eternal life because of all of the events that took place in that movie. Because he loved me and you and you so much that he gave his life up for us in the most inhumane way ever immaginable. I will take that gift with me forever.

I can't imagine how anyone could be neutral.I believe Christians, rather than Jews, are poised to be most rattled by this movie.  Afterall, doesn't it challenge our tendency to gloss hurriedly over those aweful twelve hours of concrete love, afraid that they may actually summon us to be the followers of Christ that we're supposed to be (or not)?For me, this movie captures the drama of that question.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A290JZU00TFS9D	Fuchsia	I was really excited to see this movie but unfortuntly it was a big disappointment. I thought I was going to be watching a really spiritual, inspiring film but what I got instead was a big gorey bloodbath. I honestly don't understand how anyone could have a positive spiritual experience from watching this film. I found the violence to be extremely alienating and after awhile it even got a bit tedious. This is just like a big action movie, lots of blood and gore and people fighting and running around screaming. Mel seemed more interested with the violence and blood than he did with the message. Watching a person being tortured for over two hours isn't very inspiring, even if that person is Christ. The flashbacks were good and I'd rather have watched them than watched the overly violent scenes.To say some positive things about this movie, it is very well acted and the direction is just beautiful. Many of the scenes look like paintings. And I didn't see one speck of anti-semeticism in the movie. The worst characters in this film were the Roman soilders. Even though it was well acted and well directed I still don't like this movie.I don't understand why everybody is saying that this film will make people treat other people nicer after they've watched it. In this movie the violence and gore is considered more important than Jesus' teachings. We get a (very) little bit of the Sermon on the Mount about loving your enemy and that's about it.	1.0	A Bloodbath	2004-03-01	41	20	21

After going back several times I located an image of a face after the 17 minute and 17 second count from my dvd player.  The beginning is stunning in sound and visual, the arabic language brings the entire ensemble together, I am emotionally engaged in the story and visuals.  Mel Gibson knows how to make use of  the widescreen, you won't catch much on full screen.  I will write the rest of my review afterwards.This film has me locked in, I am totally a bystander witnessing the event that takes place.  I am taken into the film probably just as the director had wanted the viewers to feel.  I also wanted to scream, ""stop this""  as some of the people (mostly the women) are objecting to the soldiers brutal torture of an innocent flesh and blood man.  I feel just as Mary does, seeing her son take such inhuman punishment that no ordinary person would withstand and yet her image of when he was a little boy falling and getting hurt, her outreached arms ready to cradle and caress him in comfort from his pain.  She wanted to be able to do that now but she felt helpless.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A355ZM6JQPYBKB	"Gabriel Benhamou ""Gabriel"""	Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece. He carved this film out of his bleeding heart. I, as a Jew, did not feel offended by it. On the contrary, I was proud that Jesus Christ was  Jewish. I never agreed to the antagonistic approach of the rabbis concerning Jesus.  Jesus Christ's prophecy was addressed to the jews initially. His godly message turned it into a universal message.The film is brilliantly directed. The actors are wonderful. Their anonimity adds to the quality of their acting. However, what gives this film its uniqueness is the compassion and love it reflects. I loved it.	5.0	One from the heart	2005-02-23	10	7	3

After two hours of occasionally yawns, I walked away with two impressions: 1) I didn't see why some in the Jewish community called this ""anti-semitic""; anti-high priests of the time, maybe, but not anti-Jewish; and 2) the violence in the movie was not too bad, at least not in this day and age where every other movie shows you what a cadaver should look like.Overall I found the movie visually compelling.  The use of lighting is wide-ranging, to the point of too much instead of too effective.  What I could not grasp was exactly what the movie was trying to say.  It seemed to me that the movie was just trying to deliver a visual impact but otherwise offered nothing much of substance.  Don't get me wrong.  If you are really into the Christ stuff, you may find this moving and ""educational.""

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3FX1A94LFJ907	"""gala16"""	"I truly believe that people who get ""offended"" by the violence shown in the movie, should go to the library and get some text on the crucifixion and other methods of torture used by the Romans. What we see is a true, accurate depiction of the horrors committed not only against Jesus but against all those who opposed the Romans. The only thing we are spared is the smell of the flesh starting to rot in the sun and the buzzing of flies ready to go for it. I think we are mature enough to watch a true, accurate depiction of the horrors of the crucifixion. If we can watch people and guts flying about in Saving Private Ryan, we can certainly watch the way Jesus and many others under Roman domination suffered and died. However, I think the reality must have been 100 times worse than what Mr. Gibson depicts in his movie. We have become very comfortable in many aspects of our life, including religion. Everything needs to be ""sanitized"" lest it hurts our ""sensibilities"". Well, you know what, Jesus died for us, for all of us, so the least we can do is endure a couple of hours of gory detail to be able to appreciate the extent of his sacrifice. The clean image of Jesus on the cross with a couple of scratches and a little drop of blood on his forehead may be very beautiful and artistic, but it is just that, an artistic representation of a horrible, cruel act. Thank you Mr Gibson for not being afraid to show a very close representation of the real suffering of our Saviour."	5.0	Moving	2004-02-25	80	68	12
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I	"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan"""	I have just watched this movie for the first time today and I have to say that it is just incredible. Some of the movie is of Catholic influence, but the majority of the story is the same. No, this isn't too violent, this is exactly what happened to Jesus 2,000 years ago for us. If anything, it was even more violent than what was shown on the movie.My only complaint is that they focused on the most important part of the story, the crucifiction for our sins, but not really on anything else. They had segments every now and then of flashbacks, mainly when Jesus saw something it reminded him of something he did in his ministry in the past. I would have liked to have seen more of his ministry as well as his trial and cross. They resurrection at the end was a little short since it doesn't tell what happened after he walked out of the tomb alive.Jim does an excellent job at portraying Jesus. Perfect for the role, and if you know the behind the scenes story, he went through a lot to do this movie, everybody did.Overall, this is a fantastic movie that shows what Christ Jesus went through for our sins, but it left out some back story. This movie would probably be understood better by those who already know the story. In the movie, they talk of his miracles, but never actually really show any of them. That should have been explained a little better for those who don't really know the story.With that said, this movie is very very good and is a must see. It's not anti-jew or extremely violent, it's what's written in the Bible.	5.0	Excellent Film	2005-08-30	10	8	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	Christ prays in Gethsemane. He is confronted by Satan, who takes the form of a man-woman. A serpent slithers from Satan toward him; Christ crushes it with his foot. Thus begins Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ, a film that has sharply divided both Christians and cinema critics.At moments this is a fine film, indeed an occasionally brilliant one. The cast is excellent; the use of Latin and Aramaic is remarkable; the cinematography exceptional; the production values are first rate. But The Passion is also an extremely inconsistent film that repeatedly undercuts itself through Hollywood flourishes and excessive fiddling with the Gospels on which it is based.In truth, the film says less about the Gospels than it does about the way in which director Gibson reads them. The film is extremely homophobic, first presenting Satan as a multi-sexual entity and then depicting Herod and his entire court as a host of screaming drag queens. The film is also, in my opinion, extremely anti-Semitic--but in a way that many will find hard to pinpoint, for it achieves that tone through the way it is cast and the way various characters are played off each other.What the film isn't is greatly spiritual: with copious amounts of blood, it is more about the hell inflicted on the body than it is about the soul that transcends the torment. And it is here, really, that Gibson most vividly overplays his hand. After a certain point the violence becomes unbelievable, and I found myself wondering more about the special effects than I was actually caught up in the movie.If you've never bothered to learn exactly what sort of horror a crucifixion was, The Passion will certainly enlighten you--and at times it may even move you to tears. But ideally you should read all four Gospels and do a survey of Roman Catholic tradition re the passion before you walk in the door. That way you'll know the difference between text, tradition, and Gibson's inventions. Three stars for an excellent cast, production values, and being generally thought-provoking.GFT, Amazon Reviewer	3.0	Problematic At Best	2004-02-26	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	Pity Tom Cruise didn't take the lead. That would have been an entertaining two hours for me. Mind you, Tom has been flagillating himself so much in his recent pictures, that he probably decided on a break. Besides, Jesus doesn't wear a mask. Instead, they got a chap who looks uncannily like Daniel Day-Lewis. In which case, why not get Daniel Day-Lewis? Then you can have sliced ham. Didn't Judas look like Roman Polanski though? Oh, look, Monica Belucci is in floods of tears. Don't know why, she went through worse during 'Irreversible'. She even had a running commentary going on in her ear. A sort of director's commentary, if you will. In this film, Jesus does the commentary.People were eating a lot before the film began, which worried me. I didn't want to get some barf down my neck. I was worried enough through that Anna Friel advert. I have to say, though, that the much vaunted violence was mostly hype. I watched the film without flinching. It was tasteful, almost chocolate boxy. Did anyone else giggle when that Jewish guy reluctantly 'volunteered' to help Jesus with his cross? He almost dropped it on him. As if the poor chap hadn't had enough punishment for one day. The only bit that made me react was the Roman telling his men to turn Jesus face down after being nailed to the cross. Steady on, chaps, that's a bit strong, I thought. Ironically, it was the only time Jesus didn't end up face down in the dirt. Thank heavens for small mercies, eh? Slam dancers and stage divers of the punk era will admire Jesus's technique throughout.I didn't find the film anti-Semitic. It was even handed to the point of political correctness. It was dare I say, even pro-Jewish. There's a saying, which I can't quite remember: Get three Jews together and you'll have five different opinions (or something). I think the film puts that over well. If anything, it could be construed as pro-Israel, as the average Jew certainly needed to get some protection, baby, instead of being the world's whipping boy.I walked out of this film smiling. Very little impact emotionally, or otherwise. Ironically, 'Life Of Brian' comes across as far more disingenuous that 'Passion', as it claimed not to be about Jesus at all. But that film was subversive because it held a mirror up to the past and made us question if it was very much different from the reality of the modern world. If we couldn't believe in a Messiah walking around now, why should we believe it was any more credible then?Mel's superstitious film, with its proposterous supernatural impositions, make your jaw hit your lap.

It is The Texas Chainsaw massacre or Faces of Death 5 of our generation. Just when you thought horrible fanatical death was only the perveiw of the cable news networks Mel Gibson gave us this gem of a gorefest. If you like blood, flaying, misplaced entrails and seeing a man brutally murdered this is the movie for you. Like other movies in it's genre it has no redeeming qualities but unmitigated brutality all there for you to see. What more could you ask from a movie. Now that we have this on DVD we can all sit back and enjoy the ride at home.

Just as your life is not. Mel Gibson's reason for making this movie as a creative person is very different from God's reason in getting you out there to see it.  It is something that you will never forget and will carry with you for the rest of your life. And I truly hope it's effect will grant you access to heaven.I truly believe that Mel Gibson and the actors were unknowingly being utilized by God to spread the word. Even if it is within the guise of Hollywood and creative license.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A11SSYM4ISRN1I	gclaheh	I watched the Passion of the Christ with my atheist husband.  While we were watching all of the blood and guts flying around.  He asked a wonderful question.  What is the point of this movie?  What is the movie trying to say?  Then I realize that he is totally right this movie doesn't really say anything.  All we mostly see is Jesus brutally dying on a cross and flashbacks of his life for cheap thrills.  I am a Christian and I thought that this movie really didn't have a point.  I already knew that Jesus suffered before he died; it didn't really affect me seeing it so graphically.What I mean is that if you see it from an atheist's point of view, there is no point to the movie.  The movie doesn't tell us why Jesus was dying on a cross.  Since the movie's focus is on Jesus' suffering, the message gets lost to non-believers.  Personally, I was more affected by the Book of John than by this movie.  Jesus had a lot of love for people in that movie and you couldn't help but love Him.  You don't get that watching this movie.Now I would recommend this movie to people who really hate Christians and love seeing artwork of crucifix's mutilated.

His philosophy, teachings, and sacrifices are beyond comprehension.However, i was not impressed with this movie.  The graphic detail that showed what he went through was moving, yes, but that was the whole movie.  Everyone knows what Jesus went through, so I didn't see it as necessary to drag it out for 2 hours with occasional flashbacks.I think it was like watching Braveheart, but having the movie begin where Wallace was captured, and covering for the most part his trial and torture, and ultimate death.  Then adding intermitent flashbacks of other parts of the movie.  I appologize to anyone this may offend, i recoginize that this is a sensitive subject, but I'm unimpressed.*Final point: this may be some of the best cinematography I've ever seen.  from that aspect I would give the movie six stars.	2.0	God bless Him, however disappointing	2004-03-08	27	6	21

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ABYTU7EFC5E1Y	"gene park ""Gene Park:  Freelance Writer/Adven..."	"The theatre was already packed and the movie wasn't going to start for another fifteen minutes.  Already I was annoyed with ""The Passion of The Christ"".  After walking up and down the rows looking for a decent seat in the dark for about five minutes, I absent-mindedly blurted out a frustrated ""JEEZUS CHRIST!""  An uncomfortable silence followed.  Heads turned.  Dirty looks were given.  I finally realized what I had done and let out a hearty laugh.  Another great moment for my memoirs, but also the moment that I realized I was in the wrong movie, surrounded by the wrong people.Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of The Christ"", which was formerly ""The Passion of Christ"" and before that ""The Passion"", was made for a very specific audience, the kind of audience that lives and breathes Jesus of Nazareth all day, every day. The kind of people whom have memorized the Bible.  The kind of people that still take offense in this day and age whenever an innocent bystander takes ""The Lord's"" name in vain.  I do not come from that kind of people, and yet, I had still paid for a ticket for this movie.  Why?  Because I had heard it was the most violent film ever made.  My desensitization to movie violence needed a new challenge, and so I went.By the time I had finally made it to see this film, however, my need for gratuitous bloodshed was fading and I walked into the theatre wanting to know more about Jesus Christ.  I have not read the Bible and was yearning to learn something from this movie.  But instead of two hours of education on the life of Jesus and his beliefs, my Friday night consisted of watching two hours of footage of actor Jim Cavaziel getting whipped and falling down in the dirt.  Here's a synopsis of the film: Jesus of Nazareth (Cavaziel) is betrayed by Judas for thirty pieces of silver.  He's beaten, whipped, and torn apart.  Then he's forced to march to his crucifixtion, carrying his own cross.  Jesus stumbles for five minutes, he falls down in the dirt, he gets whipped, he gets back up and the cycle begins again.  This goes on for an hour.  Thirty minutes of this film is Jesus falling down in slow motion.  Then he's crucified.Is this film violent?  Yes.  Should it have been rated NC-17?  Yes.  Were there little kids in the audience who's parents felt it was okay to bring them to this movie because it was about Jesus?  Yes, and it makes me sick because I know--I know--that some of those parents are the same people who protest against violence in film and television.  It makes me even sicker that the theatre was showing trailers for Disney cartoons before the movie started.  Let's soften the kids up before unleashing two hours of senseless violence upon them.  Great marketing scheme.Gibson, who directed and co-wrote the film, made no attempt to educate.  Instead, he set out to depict the last twelve hours of Jesus's life.  In this aspect, he succeeds, but as a storyteller or an educator, he fails.  Gibson brings in characters without any introduction or indication of who they are.  He assumes that everyone already knows what this movie is about.  I felt like I had walked into the middle of the story, although, more accurately, I had walked into the end.  Short flashbacks of other moments in Jesus's life do little to reveal what he so strongly believed in or why he was punished for the sin of man.  What I did learn from this experience is that Jesus was a self-righteous cult leader who died for his beliefs in a time where freedom of thought and religion were not tolerated.  Yes, Jesus was a pompous, egotistical cultist.  This is by no means a criticism of any religion or anyone's beliefs.  It is merely what I observed in this film.  Another observation I made was that Mel Gibson has now become the most pretentious man on Earth.  Him and Jesus deserve each other.I can't argue that the quality of the film is superb.  The cinematography is beautiful, especially in an eerie scene when Judas is attacked by demon-children.  It's a truly frightening scene which brought to mind fond memories of ""The Lord of the Rings"".  In fact, the highlights of the movie all involve Satan, portrayed by a very androgynous actress who's lines were dubbed over with a male's voice.  The film's portrayal of the ultimate evil is exactly what it should be-evil.  My body froze over when Satan walked though the crowd, nursing what seemed at first to be a baby.If the Word of God is ""Watch my son get beaten to death and you will enter Heaven"" I don't need to be hearing it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3EFCK0HZQPNQI	Geoff Puterbaugh	"When I was younger, phrases like ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" seemed like ad slogans and I ignored them.Now that I'm older, it strikes me that the tale of Jesus Christ is indeed the greatest story ever told.  Whether it be true or false (historically) it has certainly attracted an enormous number of believers -- and, as an amateur historian with a large library of books about Christianity, I have little doubt that the main outlines of the story of Jesus are true.Which leads me to echo another reviewer: Is this the way we human beings treat God?  You might want to take a look at Dostoevski's tale of ""The Grand Inquisitor"" (in his novel ""The Brothers Karamazov"") for another perspective on the idea that human beings cannot live with the idea of God -- that we cannot tolerate it.Mel Gibson's terrific movie presents that horrifying idea in a way that will not be forgotten.  A cinematic masterpiece."	5.0	A terrific movie	2012-09-01	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AQ2UXJITW1JRT	"Geoffrey A. Middleton ""Average Joe"""	"Despite Mel Gibson's personal beliefs, yes I liked the Controversial film.  And Controversial films are usually the best ones made.  But some of us seem to be talking about just the disturbing gory violent scenes.  I pointed out a few details to my boyfriend on the older DVD using freeze frame.  He's Christain, I'm Wiccan, We Co-Exist and we like the film.As a film buff, I'd prefer to stick to the story of the film and pay little attention to the disturbing violence (Ex. when Jesus' flesh is ripped, exposing his ribs).  And speaking of which, you haven't seen ""disturbing violence"" until you have seen another Controversial film, Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" with Dustin Hoffman, which didn't rely on gore.When I saw it in the movie theater on Free Movie Night (College Students Only) in 2006, a friend of mine sat next to me and grabbed my arm.  When we were watching the crucifiction and the Roman soldier had to pull Christ's arm out of the socket, I immediately told her to let go.So, living in the bible-belt and going to college there as well, there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the theater let everyone out, except for 4 of us that had walked over from rehearsal for Orpheus Descending.Personally, I still don't think ""The Passion"", while focusing on the last day of the life of Jesus Christ, can compare with the similar retellings like ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" with Max Von Sydow, ""Jesus of Nazareth"" with Robert Powell, the equally controversial ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" with Willem Dafoe & ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" with Ted Neeley.  But, I think ""The Passion"" has a place in history as being a film that did touch the hearts and minds of people who believe what they believe in this century.  And while it is the most violent portrayal of the last day, it can't be denied that these things happened.It's still a good, but Controversial film.  But as I said before, Controversial films are usually the best ones ever made."	4.0	OK I'll admit... I liked it, but it's not as violent as Straw Dogs	2007-01-24	17	5	12

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3JYPPAUVUKRCL	george	A powerfully portrayed movie of Mel Gibson's thoughts on the last twelve hours of Christ life here on earth.  For months he thoroughly researched the Gospels in order to give the viewer something to think about.  It gave me the feeling that I was actually participating in the events.  I feel it accurately reveals from a humanistic stand point what Christ went through for us.  Not only from the anguish and pain of the blows He suffered, but also the pain from taking on our sins.  We have been blessed to step through this small window and take a look @ our past.  Through God's help, Mel Gibson has painted an epic picture for all mankind.	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-02-29	2	1	1

Seeing what the Lord went through for ALL of us, touched me beyond any words that I could possibly type. Even though the film is subtitled in English, I found myself understanding it completely without reading the subtitles.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1UE3O7AJ71FVE	George Koulousias	"I saw this film on the second day of it's theatrical release. The movie is powerful and compelling, yet left me wanting to see and learn more about this Jesus. Gibson spends too much time on the scourging by the Roman soldiers and other acts of brutality; Jesus being pushed over a bridge hanging by a chain, his endless walk through the crowded streets of Jerusalem on the way to Golgotha, a crow poking at the non-repentant thief's eye during the crucifixion. I could go on and on, but I don't have to, Mel does that in the movie. I appreciated some of the flashbacks that were shown in trying to show what this man, Jesus was about. Those scenes were too brief and just rushed by. The CBS movie, Jesus, released in 2000, did a much better job in showing the appeal and the message of this man, Jesus. In discussing this film with others, the general opinion is if you take the Bible literally, you find this motion picture very moving and satisfying because of the suffering Jesus accepted on our behalf. On the other hand, if you take the Bible seriously but look at it metaphorically, you are put off by the fundamentalist message of suffering, guilt, and redemption that Mel Gibson is tossing out to the faithful. Mel is very much into suffering and taking beatings, just look at his films from the ""Lethal Weapon"" series to ""Braveheart"". The best thing about this film from my viewpoint is that it makes a serious seeker want to reexamine Jesus, and I mean Jesus of Nazareth, the Jesus of history, not Jesus Christ, the Jesus of faith. Both views of Jesus are important to study and understand, just don't let the flowering visions of the ""Christ of Faith, that a lot of traditional Christians have cloud your look at the marvelous Jesus of Nazareth that is portrayed so vividly in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke. John's Gospel is very spiritual but it definitely portrays Jesus as God ""in the flesh"". If this film makes people want to restudy Jesus in the Gospels, it has done an excellent job of evangelizing. If you have a more liberal view of the Gospels and Jesus, please read any book by Marcus Borg. It will enlighten you. I sincerely hope that all may find the ""Peace of Christ"" that is within you all. As for this film being Anti- Semitic, just look at the four Gospel accounts of Jesus' arrest, trial, and crucifixion, then make up your own mind."	3.0	The Passion of Mel Gibson	2004-04-23	13	3	10
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1CM16PFHOUY3P	George Markulis	"One observation that can almost be stated as fact - whenever the subject of Jesus is addressed in film and in virtually all art forms, for that matter, there is sure to be some sort of accompanying controversy that goes along with the artist's individual statement.  There are many who are and were against ""The Passion of the Christ"" because of all of the anti-Semitic hype generated before the film's release.  Many were opposed to its graphic violence.  Some were opposed to Mel Gibson's deviations from the Gospels in his decision to incorporate non-Biblical sources and artistic license to fill in some of the gaps in narrative.  Unfortunately, many find it difficult to get past some of these controversies and preconceptions to fully begin to appreciate and respect the film for its message and its purpose.  Mel Gibson set out to give us a very real and vivid telling of the Passion narrative - one that will serve as a visual context into which to place these events from Jesus' life.  Unfortunately, many of the previous Hollywood treatments of Jesus (there are a few exceptions of course) have made him a very inaccessible person - emphasizing the divine nature rather than man.  Jesus was a very real person, a man who experienced every emotion, feeling, & temptation that every human has and will.  The Jesus in ""The Passion"" is both divine and a very real man, a man that we see being put to the test - both in spiritual and physical terms.  He is a man who faces up to the temptations of the devil and his own fears of His Father's abandonment to accomplish his mission.  I believe that the realistic violence depicted in the film is truly necessary and essential to fully understand and convey the impact of the sacrifice Jesus has made for us.  After all, Roman capitol punishment was very real, brutal and barbaric in its nature.Although ""The Passion"" is more of a spiritual experience rather than a cinematic one for me, aesthetically, the film itself is very well made and wonderful to look at.  The cinematography is beautiful, as are the costumes and set design.  The acting is very top notch and convincing.  I especially admire Maia Morgenstern's moving depiction of the Virgin Mary and Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Christ.  The part of Jesus, as written in the context of this film, really necessitates more of a non-verbal and physical presence in the role which I believe Jim Caviezel fulfills perfectly.  I truly respect his spiritual and physical dedication to the title role.There are many images in ""The Passion of the Christ"" that I will never forget - nor will I ever want to.  For me, these images will always serve as a visual reminder of these events to ponder while reflecting on the Passion of Jesus Christ.  I hope that once the hype and controversy around this film subside as the years pass, viewers will appreciate the true message of the film and have that message enrich their spirituality after watching it. I tip my hat to Mel Gibson for having the conviction to take on such a project and to not compromise his vision in the process."	5.0	A Film for Reflection	2005-03-23	5	0	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AW8MR209ZXGRO	George Rhodes	"When I watched ""The Passion,"" I came away with this take. The movie does answer many questions, one must only look a little deeper and pay attention to what is being said and shown.From the start, we do know why Jesus had to suffer as He did. The Old Testament scripture is quoted during the first part of the screen, Isaiah 53:5, ""He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we are healed."" It was sin that caused this incredible suffering. And what Jesus went through was torture. Unfortunately, his crucifixion has been candy coated for so long by every artist's rendering that we have all begun to accept that Jesus' death on the cross was somehow a sterile bloodless event when that was never the case with any Roman crucifixion. The scourging that took place was known as the ""near death"" it was so horrific. And Jesus and many others went through that horrible torture. The Apostle Paul, a Jew and a Roman citizen, was beat 39 times himself. It was then and continues to be one of the worst tortures known in the ancient world.The Passion also blames someone very directly for the death of Jesus. Jesus said in the movie and in the Gospels, no man takes my life, I give it up willingly. No one killed Jesus, Jesus' death was in the plan of God from the beginning as the lamb slain before the foundations of the world.I know that the cross is offensive. It has always been offensive and always will be.  The Apostle Paul reminded us, ""we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to Gentiles"" (1 Corinthians 1:23). The cross is ugly, horrible, bloody, gory, difficult to understand, and any other words you would like to use. We have always known that. Now that it is seen in all its horror and bloodiness, many shy away. The cross to me is more than a symbol of hatred, anger, and derision; it is a demonstration of God's love. In fact, it was the greatest demonstration of God's love in all of human history. Jesus died in my place and took my sin upon Him so that I could (and you could) have abundant and eternal life. That's what the Cross of Christ is all about. And I believe this movie, when you watch it through eyes like mine does not see Jews or Romans or Priests or Proconsuls as having been responsible for the death of Jesus, but my sin and the sin of the world.There is no doubt from history or tradition that the cross was bloody or vile or evil or torturous. It's simply the first time it's been seen on a movie screen for all the world to see how awful it was. This movie for me was more than a movie, it was an experience that I will never forget. You see, for me the cross is the center of all I believe and hope for. Without it, I have nothing but despair and darkness. For it was in that darkest hour on the Cross that the price for my sin was paid in full and made me whole. I will never get over that.Go see this landmark movie. It may change the way you look at life."	5.0	The Blood of Jesus Christ Saves Us from Our Sin	2004-04-12	18	11	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AV7ATN4TN8AQT	"GeoX ""GeoX"""	"I dunno...I watched this movie expecting it to, at least, arouse SOME sort of emotion, but really, my strongest reaction ended up being, okay...that was pretty boring.  The problem is, it's just dramatically inert.  There's no sort of progression or anything; just wham wham wham the power of christ compels you the end--and the violence is so stylized that even the most basic of visceral reactions is precluded.  Further, Jesus in this movie is so obviously an allegory rather than an actual person that it's impossible to feel anything for him.  They might as well be beating on a pinata.  There's a VERY short snippet from the Sermon on the Mount, and a few other flashbacks, but really, who's fooling whom?  These have about the same weight as story segments in a porn film (which this in many ways IS); they're a tedious obligation, and underplayed as much as possible...which may well be a blessing in disguise; while Caviezel is adequate as a meat puppet, he's not so much so when required to actually, you know, act.  The only at all sympathetic, interesting, or indeed human character in the film is Pilate (though the scene with the camp King Herod is one of the movie's few truly amusing moments); however, as far as that goes, you'd probably be better off just reading The Master and Margarita.In many ways, the film's anti-semitism is the least of its problems; however, it is there for anyone who cares to see it.  Physically, the hook-nosed, beady-eyed, conniving Jewish patriarchs embody every Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion-style stereotype in the book (whereas Jesus and the posse are clearly already Christians, in spite of actually being, you know, Jewish themselves), and while the Roman soldiers may be comically sadistic, the Patriarchs are obviously the primary villains here; the solidiers are just their blunt instruments.  It's not necessarily something that's going to leap out at you unless you're really looking to have your prejudices reinforced, but I can see it being pretty unhealthy for anyone on a subliminal level.Granite, there is a fair level of artistry here, even if most of it's wasted.  The opening is atmospheric (though that mood is quickly destroyed when the disciples start busting out the mad ninja skillz on the Roman soldiers), and the creepy androgynous Satan is reasonably cool.  Also...okay, actually, that's about all.  I didn't find the film particularly painful to sit through, but I don't really recommend it either, except in a ""see what everybody's talking about"" way.  But if you do see it, you have to follow it up with South Park's ""Passion of the Jew.""  Hysterical stuff."	2.0	I get knocked down! But I get up again! You're never gonna	2004-09-19	22	11	11

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ZLUMSWANRYXL	Giuseppe Tulli	"The Passion, as an episode almost self-sufficient in itself as is portrayed in this film, will never be ""enough"" to convey what is most paradoxical and significant about it, namely it's MEANING. Tons of minute details of how painful the episode is will not fill such substantial lack of inner structure.Greek Tragedy in fact distinctly omitted the PASSION episode - the SPARAGMOS or dismemberment of the tragic hero - from the play, because the PROCESS that led to it and ""resurrection"" (ANAGNORISIS) - were the elements to be focused upon in order to have a COMPLETE experience, which to me implies MEANING.Passion, like any other form of human suffering needs PROCESS, preparation and elements that can make us UNDERSTAND its meaning. So it's been given to us in the scriptures, with enough context to grasp its place within man's spiritual essence.Otherwise we're left with an incomplete sense of injustice where some will have to play the ""good"" and others the ""evil"" part.Eventually this has been the inevitable case with the piece-of-the-story told in this movie.I give 2 stars to its - non relevant - aesthetics."	2.0	Can suffering - only by itself - be MEANINGFUL?	2004-03-03	27	11	16

So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However, I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.

But that really didn't affect my reaction to this film, which is a brutal, trashy piece of Christ-propaganda.  Christ was not the only person of that time period who suffered through this much torture and brutality.  It was commonplace for people who had differences with those in authority to be beaten and executed.  Mel fails to explain what singled out Christ as a symbol of good because a)he is a shallow and poor filmmaker and b)he doesn't care, he just wants an excuse to show people lots of sickening violence to spark their guilt.

I am grateful that they would feel sympathy and have trouble watching anyone suffer like this, but the point of the film is to help the modern person to remove their sanitized version of Jesus death and impress upon us all that ""GOD"" suffered in ""OUR"" place. I realize many viewers of this film may not have faith that Jesus was GOD in the flesh, but for the Christian, Jesus experienced this for me and you and that we are responsible for his suffering and Death.  By our individual rejection of GOD we inflicted this on Jesus. It isn't anti Roman or anti Jew, it is about all of Humanities need to be saved from death. The death Jesus experienced was physically horrible but even greater was his Mental anguish caused by the Father turning away from him. Jesus experienced separation from the Father and all the mental anguish that is associated with that. Jesus experienced HELL for us so we don't have to.the Bible says,""for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God,"" Romans 3:23 and that the wages of sin is death Romans 6:23 and that while we were yet sinners Christ Died for us. ""But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."" Romans 5:8.For me personally who has accepted that Jesus is the Christ, this movie's graphic nature started me in a way that awakened my sensibility of what Jesus did for me.

The Pain of Mary seen through the eyes of her love for her son captured my heart. She as for Christ forgave everyone who tormented the only man that the only crime for spreading the Lord God message was crucified on the cross. The people that wanted Christ put to death condemned him because they were afraid and ignorant of change. Mass hysteria created by ignorance fueled the hotheaded masses to put Christ to death. Fear of the unknown at that era was the Justice the church & people wanted.  Christ knew he had to leave this mortal life on earth to a higher purpose. But his Love for mankind shunted his existence.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1CIW2OEVAJRM2	Godly Gadfly	"This controversial movie about the final hours of Christ's suffering leading up to his death has received rave reviews from many leaders in the general Christian community, who laud it as a very realistic portrayal of Christ's life, and a thoroughly moving experience.  Being moved by the images, drama, music, and graphic violence of an R rated movie is different than being moved by the gospel.  I want to go on record as a Christian leader who does not share the enthusiasm.  The film's producer, Mel Gibson, is a devout Roman Catholic, and as a devout Protestant I cannot share his passion for this project, for several reasons:1. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MESSAGEa) A distorted message.Despite its claims about authenticity and accuracy, ""The Passion of the Christ"" does not replicate the gospel accounts, but presents a distorted view of the gospels influenced by Gibson's Roman Catholic background.  Gibson has supplemented the Biblical gospel accounts with source material from the diaries of a Catholic mystic (Anne Catherine Emmerich's ""The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ"")  This is plainly evident in the prominent portrayal of Mary, and the link between the cross and the altar of the mass - important themes peculiar to Roman Catholic theology.  The gospel according to Mel is not the same as the gospel according to Matthew.b) An incomplete message.Secular viewers cannot be expected to understand what they're seeing without a fuller proclamation of the doctrine of sin and salvation.  Little wonder that many non-Christian viewers left the theatre confused.  Is this any surprise?  The Ethiopian eunuch described in Acts 8 had the same reaction when he read about Christ's suffering in Isaiah 53.  When asked ""Do you understand what you are reading?"" he answered ""How can I, unless someone explains it to me?""  A cinematic version of Christ's suffering is in itself incomplete without the preaching of the gospel and a call to faith.  It shows *how* Jesus died, but not *why* He died.  Without someone explaining it, is it any wonder that unbelieving viewers do not understand what they are seeing?  Instead of leaving the cinema as new converts, many non-Christians left disgusted at the graphic violence (which many attest is worse than they've seen in any secular movies), convinced the movie was more bloody than spiritual, and questioning the credibility of Christians who normally abhor Hollywood's violence.2. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MEDIUMAside from the fact that the movie's doctrinal content is questionable, the whole notion of turning the Bible into film form is seriously suspect. It is not only the message that is influenced by Roman Catholic theology, but also the medium.a) Presenting the gospel in film *can* not be done.A movie about Christ's life inevitably includes significant speculation and fiction, and even the best attempts to be ""authentic"" will ultimately be a distortion of the Bible. What makes Christ's suffering unique is that it was accompanied by a sense of God's wrath and curse which sinners deserve.  A film might attempt to portray the horror of physical suffering and torture, but it cannot do justice to the spiritual aspect of being cursed by God, which the Bible highlights as the most significant aspect of Christ's suffering.  Translating the gospels into film and doing full justice to God's revelation in the Bible is impossible.b) Presenting the gospel in film *may* not be done.Sola Scriptura (by Scripture alone) is a basic Biblical principle defended by Protestant Churches with their roots in the Reformation.  It is echoed in many of their confessional documents, such as Lord's Day 35 of the Heidelberg Catechism in connection with the second commandment: God ""wants His people to be taught not by means of dumb images but by the living preaching of His Word."" We should not be wiser than God. The means that the Holy Spirit uses to work and strengthen faith is the reading and preaching of God's Word, along with the sacraments. Translating the Bible narratives about Christ into the visual images of film ultimately suggests an insufficiency in the Word and Sacraments, and at bottom tries to cater to man's natural curiosity and dissatisfaction with the written Word! Christians should not be surprised to find themselves curious about how this film presents Christ's life, since sinful hearts are naturally not content with limiting themselves to God's revelation and His official means of grace.  Such fascination is precisely the reason for the appeal of all violations of the second commandment. We must however limit ourselves to the official means of grace that the most wise God has ordained to be the food of our soul: the audible preaching and the visible sacraments.Many Christians who are enthusiastic about this movie may be disappointed at my lack of enthusiasm for a project that purports to honour Christ.  But being Biblical is more than just about getting the message right, it's about getting the medium right too. Noble ambitions do not justify the use of methods that are not pleasing to God.  It's surprising that Protestants would uncritically accept a movie that in principle is the contemporary equivalent of a Roman Catholic stained glass window, a cinematic ""image"" used in addition to the Bible to teach people the gospel.  Is the Bible really so deficient that we need this?  This is an opportunity to renew a passion for the Word - read and preached - which reveals the living Christ. Ultimately only the Bible must shape my understanding of Christ's suffering, the gospel according to Matthew, not the gospel according to Mel.  If you are looking for greater insight into Christ's passion, and if you want your understanding of Jesus Christ to be based on the Bible alone, then my advice is: don't watch the movie, but read the Book! - GODLY GADFLY"	1.0	Don't watch the movie, but read the Book!	2004-08-18	80	24	56

Based on what is assumed to be a true story to many (though credible the evidence is certainly not) Mel Gibson basically beats the audience over the head with excessive violence and gore in order to get them to embrace his warped view of the world.So-called Chrisitans take note - you are endorsing the same torture porn that you so readily abuse hollywood for (in such movies as ""Hostel"" and ""Saw 1-4). I believe last time I was unfortunate enough to hear a sermon hypocrisy was still a sin.Cinematograpy-wise the film impresses, and you have to be impressed by Jim Cavisiel's performance (or endurance really) but this is a sick, twisted, nasty squalid little film that if was about Harry down the street rather than Jebus the Christians would have condemned it outright.That being said, an honest film made about god's killing and maiming in the OT would also be just as repugnant - but at least it would make a more interesting story than watching this guy getting beating (and no-one could endure the pain).They say it's good to show the extent of the sacrifice that Jesus apparantly made, but what's the big sacrifice anyway when he knew he'd be back new and improved in 3 days time anyway and would get to fly off to heaven and come back a bit later to slaughter the rest of humanity (if they don't believe).Yuck, left a foul taste in my mouth this one - really Mel I wish you'd made Lethal Weapon 5 instead."	1.0	Sick pseudo snuff movie.	2007-12-10	18	4	14

Gibson's shocking depiction of the incredible suffering endured by Jesus actually leaves the viewer shaken; how could one man endure such torture?Jim Caviezel gives the performance of a lifetime.  Under piles of bloody makeup, his eyes say everything.  No grandiose pronouncements here - just suffering.  Gibson lets the viewer ponder just how vicious and hateful humankind is capable of being.  One watches the awful flogging of Jesus and can't help but think of all the monstrous genocidal rampages that have taken place throughout our history.  The perpetrators seem almost drunk in their enjoyment at inflicting such pain...they laugh and joke about it.One also cannot help but consider just how powerful one person's death can become.  Jesus death eventually brought about the conquest of the most powerful empire on Earth by the religion his sacrifice created.

He wanted to make it real for people.  Too many of us have been emotionally and intellectually removed from the Gospels for too long.He succeeded in his aim beautifully.  This movie makes you feel as though you are really there watching it happen.  Gibson based the suffering of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin.  Whether you accept that as Jesus' burial cloth or not, it was a true crucifixion of a man from Jesus' time period and it most certainly was horrific.  People are complaining about that - apparently they believe that Jesus shouldn't have allowed His death to be so brutal - they don't like it to be so messy and ugly.  They don't want to see the true physical side of the story.Don't look away - look at the price of our sins.  The evil that Jesus suffered & the evil that is in our world are the result of our sins - even the little piddly ones that we're just sure don't matter that much.  Those characters are all real - I've seen those Roman torturers before - in school when I was growing up.  They were dressed differently, but I remember the cruelty and the jeering laughter quite clearly and the expressions on their faces were just the same.James Caviezel is the definitive Jesus.  There will never be another actor who can top his performance.  If the Oscars were real, Caviezel would win hands down, no contest.All the actors and actresses were top notch.  Gibson's inspiration for depicting satan as an androgynous character was sheer genius.  On the surface, he/she always looks almost attractive, but the hints of corruption and evil keep slipping past the facade.  The eeriest aspect of the character is the cool indifference he/she shows to all the horrors he/she inspires and instigates - satan's attention is focused on the downfall of Jesus and the rest is just ""background noise"", so to speak.  It reminded me of the saying that ""The opposite of love is not hate, but indifference.""In an age where love is defined by shallow, selfish desires, this is a moving, timely reminder of what true love really is... and those who aren't acquainted with the details of the story will be inspired by it to get their hands on a Bible and find out for themselves what all the controversy is about..."	5.0	So many don't want to see the wages of sin...	2004-05-01	23	15	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	Some of the more artistically interesting human faces abound in the Mel Gibson's uncannily popular movie THE PASSION OF CHRIST.  Filmed in rich earth tones in Italy, the costumes and large supporting cast of Romans and Jews give enormous variety to what is otherwise a rather extended monotone story.  One can applaudGibson's verismo recreation of the last twelve hours of Jesus' life and like a Good Friday church service the agony of the stations of the cross are orchestrated for powerful emotional effect.  Jim Caviezel is the much beaten and suffering and crucified Jesus, but the events of Jesus' brief thirty-three  years on earth are only slightly suggested.  As with all of the ancillary characters we only are allowed to see only the agony of Mary and Magdalene and the sadomasochism of the Roman soldiers.  Little else is there to take this pageant beyond the blood and gore of the Passion.  And had Gibson been content to leave his vision there, the visceral effect would have been more moving.  Portraying Satan as a morphing female and as deformed, taunting children is over the top and pushes the film into near parody. Yet the fact that PASSION is a moving experience for millions of moviegoers is heartening:  there is enough power in this film to touch people's hearts and today that is good.	4.0	A Religious Pageant without the Good Friday Spell	2004-03-07	4	2	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A7WTP11MKSTMJ	"Graymalkin ""uilleann piper"""	"I did not decide to view The Passion of the Christ in the theater because of the hollow ""controversy"" generated by the mainstream media.  I did so instead for two reasons: first, because I felt it was a film my wife and I should experience on the big screen.  Secondly, and quite honestly, to show support for Mel Gibson.  We won't reiterate the numerous obstacles Gibson overcame to see this film would be completed.  We'll just say that the obstacles were numerous, and well publicized.  And I respect the man deeply for having endured his critics and detractors, and having the talent and courage to see his vision through.  It was Gibson's own passion that saw the realization of the film, it's authenticity, and it's sheer power.  Whether or not one is Christian, it is unfathomable that one cannot, at the very least, admire a director so passionate about his project; particularly one willing to endure the very real possibilty of becoming a pariah to the Hollywood elite.  Whether by being the victim of gloating critics should the film fail, or to simply be rejected by Hollywood by virtue of having proved them wrong (as well as the greater insult of proving that Hollywood was not needed to see the project to fruition), Gibson made a gamble.  And won.A motion picture about the final day of Jesus Christ.  In this day and age.  At a time when mainstream media and social elitist ""compassion,"" ""open-mindedness,"" ""diversity,"" and ""political correctness"" applies to all but Christians, Mel Gibson dared to give us The Passion of the Christ.As could be expected, a controversy arose with regard to accusations that the film was ""Anti-Semitic.""  Biblical and historical facts pertaining to the life of Christ and the events leading to his crucifixion are known.  Short of censoring the events from the Bible to protect those prone to oversensitivity, we can only accept historical events as they were.  To accuse this film being Anti-Semitic or inspiring such is completely unfounded, and borders upon ludicrous.  One fact has been completely overlooked by both accusers, and those accused, and it is this:Christ's crucifixion was prophesized, and necessary to fulfil His purpose.  Christ Himself spoke of it, and prepared for it.  IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED.  Had He not been brought before the Pilate, had they not cried, ""Crucify Him!"", there would be no redemption for those who believe upon Him.  Thus, the very idea of animosity toward Jews - or Italians, for that matter - for merely being a necessary part of the fulfilment of this vital Prophesy is absolutely absurd.In reading the Gospels, never have I felt that Jews ""were to blame.""  Nor did I feel anything even remotely akin to bitterness toward any People even during the most brutal scenes of the film.  Folks, the simple fact is this: at any moment Christ could indeed have ""saved himself"" by simply recanting, or denying, his words and actions.  Such practice certainly does not tarnish the reputation of modern-day politicians who, though they may have the most vehement critics, none is intent upon literally crucifying them.  Yet, Christ understood who He was, why He was, and how He was to Accomplish His Purpose.  Understood, accepted, and never denied, even to save His own life.  Honestly, as one who seeks a greater knowledge of Christ, it is unimaginable that one could ""blame"" anyone for playing a necessary part in the facilitation of what many who seek to know Him as the greatest sacrifice, and thus the greatest gift imaginable: forgiveness.I expected to cry during the film, but I could not; the intensity put me in a state beyond tears where the breath caught in my throat as I was overwhelmed by the knowledge that this was inarguably the most vivid, accurate portrayal of what Christ endured.  This was not an idealized image from a classical painting, nor a sanitized Hollywood reenactment.  What I witnessed was deeply troubling, not simply because it was graphic, but because it was horribly, agonizingly realistic.  Those who complained about the gore would do well to stick with the aforementioned diluted versions, because the scenes in Passion depicted what many dare not contemplate: the effect of unimaginably merciless torture upon human flesh.At first, I thought that subtitles would take away from the film.  I was very wrong.  Hearing the actors speak in the native tongues of the characters brought a realism that was priceless.  Hearing the words of Christ in Aramaic created an almost indescribable sense of time, and place.  And a feeling that I can only describe (though I cannot explain why I feel inclined to express it thus) as ""closeness.""  There was an intimacy, a human connection experienced that stunned me.Try as some might to convince us otherwise, the film was not in any way Anti-Semitic.  Nor was it a ""senseless bloodbath.""  What it is, quite honestly, is the most power film I have ever experienced in my life.  And I deeply respect, and humbly thank, Mel Gibson for his directorial artistry, courage . . . and faith.I have asked some this question simply to invoke thought, and I will close with it, and ask only that you give it a moment of consideration:If Christ had not existed two millennia ago, but nonetheless to fulfill the prophesy had instead been born 33 years ago, who, today, would be the ones to cry, ""Crucify Him!""?"	5.0	In a word: Intense.	2004-03-04	6	4	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AFSAD45180WP4	"Greenbloody ""greenbloody"""	Besides the religious backdrop, the main crux of this movie is to depict as much realism and authenticity as possible about the corporeal punishment during the Roman times. From the religious view point, the movie wants you to feel visually what your Lord has gone through.If you think that the 39 lashes were just mere whips, you are quite misinformed. Read Josh McDowell's book on Crucifixion and  you will get the written version about the instruments used during Jesus' time. Again, the crucifixion itself was shown under full light with no turning away of the camera.In my opinion, the movie has achieved, in stellar proportions, what it had set out to do. The additional depiction of Mary's love for her Son was well constructed, although not documented the way the movie has shown.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	APASOUCF2UD42	Greg Curtis	The Passion of the Christ, directed by Mel Gibson, is a graphic depiction of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus. Although Christ (Jim Caviezel) is shown to have healing powers, the Jewish leaders see him as a trouble-maker and turn him over to the Roman authorities on contrived charges of treason against Caesar. An oft-told story, it is Gibson's vision to focus on the horrific suffering Christ endured on the day of his crucifixion.Since religion has always been an impassioned issue liable to start wars, the needless controversy surrounding this picture arose before principal shooting had begun. The majority of the film's Jewish characters, caught up in mob mentality, are portrayed as self-righteous and uncaring. The Romans fare worse, with most of them behaving like bloodthirsty boors. Yet, history cannot be rewritten to placate sensitive individuals. If anyone today proclaimed themself a Messiah, would we not condemn him in exactly the same manner?Sadly, the trite screenplay (co-written by Gibson) assumes we know the antagonists' motivation, and barely touches upon Jesus' teachings of love and forgiveness. It chooses instead to glorify the barbaric atrocities of our race in lengthy scenes of blood-drenched torture.As the copper-eyed prophet, the usually engaging Caviezel has little to do but gasp in pain, while the two Marys drift through the draining story in tears. Pontius Pilate is depicted as a reluctant judge and Herod a fop, while the sporadic appearance of a female but deep-voiced Satan seems peculiar and out of place.Gibson also co-produced the film, which was lensed in southern Italy because of its resemblance to ancient Israel. The stained teeth and coarse clothing give the film convincing period detail, but the visuals are drab and without colour. The entire movie is also spoken in the acerbic Aramaic language and accordingly subtitled. This proves to be only mildly distracting -- the rhythmic score and too-frequent sound effects of twittering birds are far more annoying.Like Michael Cimino's infamous Heaven's Gate, The Passion of the Christ will prove to be Gibson's artistic folly. It lacks the beauty and marvel of past biblical epics, offering no entertainment or educational value. Further, there are far too many slow-motion sequences that merely accentuate the slow-moving narrative. If those opposed would simply ignore rather than protest, the film would come and go soon enough. But the curious will carry it for the first few weeks, until interest dies down and this pointless and uninspiring film is laid to rest in a sepulchre. One can only pray there will be no resurrection this time around. Rating: 2 out of 10.	1.0	Neither entertaining nor educational	2005-01-04	38	17	21
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3DXVAI08P00HD	Greg	For me, watching this movie was one of the most painful experiences I have had to endure at the screen.  The excesses of blood and gore and violence remind me of the excesses of the medieval period in representing and imitating the 'passion of Christ.'Theologically and historically, the film is quite accurate (in terms of the Gospel accounts) except for the gory detail of the suffering of Christ.  Unfortunately the Jews are depicted in quite negative terms, which does not help heal the rift between Judaism and Christianity, caused by centuries of Christian demonising of the Jews for killing God.  But the biggest repellant for me is the violence, which seems to suggest we only achieve redemption only through a very bloody human sacrifice to an angry God; something which doesn't seem in accordance with much of the theology I know.While there is no 'easy Jesus' or 'cheap grace', I believe Gibson has gone way overboard in this film with the blood and gore, which tends to obscure rather than show the love of God shown through the sacrifice of Christ.  Indeed, Jesus seems to be in so much pain for half of the time it hardly seems like divine love or the Father's will is on his mind, but sheer agony from the extreme torture.This film is certainly to be avoided for younger children and adults, and anyone watching it should be warned.	3.0	Overly violent recounting of the passion	2006-11-16	2	1	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2YNJCI2BNF79U	"Gregory A. Beamer ""Cowboy"""	"It take a lot of guts to make a movie about Jesus. Even more to show graphic detail. And, even more to release it in dead and largely dead languages. But, guts does not make a good movie by itself. Amid all the controversy, there are doubtless people with many positions and emotions, some of which are likely to be incorrect.The film starts in the garden of Gethsemane. All events prior to this point are shown in flashback. Jesus is beaten, scourged and crucified, in graphic detail. I will address different issues:Anti-Semitic: Caiaphas, overall, is not highly sympathetic. He does have a moment or two, but he is largely the one calling for the deed to be finished. The crowds cry out for Jesus' death. But, there are priests that leave the trial of Jesus in protest. There are also sympathetic crowds as Jesus winds down the Via Dolorosa. I do not see it as anti-Semitic, and, IMO, anyone who uses this film to excuse anti-Semitic behavior is an idiot.Romans: I see that Pilate, overall, is a bit too soft to be based on the historical Pilate. He is also conflicted. Overall, the Romans are brutal. I would consider most of this material historically accurate, with some embellishment of details. The Romans are given a far worse hand than the Jews. I wish I saw more conflict in Pilate.Graphic nature: When the flail gets caught during the scourging, it is agonizing to watch. The beating is merciless. The film cuts away during much of the beating, or focus on the face of Christ. I saw it as less violent than I was prepared for, while a friend saw it as worse. It is not a child's movie. I am church going; he is agnostic. It is most likely my feelings about what was going on, as part of my faith, made me wish it was worse so I could truly understand.Original Languages: I am a bit conflicted on this in many levels. First, it was Latin and Aramaic from the English translations. Having taken Latin in high school, I did catch one spot where the English subtitles did not convey the full thought of the Latin. I am not good enough to find others, just the one. I would like to see this film again when I can turn off the subtitles and just watch from a pure spectator position.I am glad that the crucifixion is intercut with the Last Supper. It softens some of the pure violence displayed. You will also notice the stations of the cross, if you have ever been around Catholic doctrine. There are other flashbacks that offer a bit of relief from the story being displayed.The Cinematography is great, as is the acting. The cinematographic style reminds me of a cross between Daviau (Color Purple) and Mathieson (Gladiator). The colors are striking in some scenes and you also get the hyper-reality in others. You forget you are watching a film at times. The fact that the actors are not well known faces may help a lot here.I have two images etched in my mind. The first is Christ saying ""Look, mother, I make all things new."" The second is His face when right after he states ""It is accomplished.""Will you like this film? Depends on a lot of things. Christians will likely laud the film, especially Evangelicals. The rest of the world will likely find the film very disturbing and perhaps a bit too violent (as my friend did). It is a harsh film. I think it is rather haunting, whether you are a Christian or not, as it deeply illustrates man's inhumanity to man.The most eerie thing about the film is the complete silence, with the exception of some weeping, when the movie ends. I did not hear anyone speaking until I got out to the parking lot. That, in and of itself, is very powerful. I have never experienced this in any film before."	5.0	Powerful and very disturbing	2004-02-26	3	3	0

There is nothing imaginative or transcendent about this film, it is just cruelty on celluloid.  A spectacle of his supreme sacrifice.The shooting of this film in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin is just a joke.  Again, it adds nothing to the story.  It is like putting the Irish Flag on an American beer, and passing it off as a ""Premium Lager"".  Somehow, because this film was shot in cryptic languages, this makes it more ""official"" than those other Jesus films made in English... The Irish flag may fool those buffoons with a poor palate, but for the real connoisseurs -- they aren't fooling anyone.This movie imparts nothing, except that we should feel guilty about what ancient people's did to a great man.

Those last twelve hours are very violent, but what else could it be.  Jesus was nailed to a cross.  Hung to die.  Blood and torture is shown throughout the movie but, that is how he died.  My wife wouldn't go so i went with my cousin.  We left the theatre in silence and didn't say a word until we were well into our trip home.

Maia Morgenstern is another really great actress, playing Mary, and she does a magnificent job.Mel Gibson took a chance with this film, and a large chance. Of course, there was criticism, just like the movies before it, The Last Temptation Of Christ, and Jesus Christ Superstar are two examples.There is one thing i did criticize and that was the violence of the movie. It just feels like Mel Gibson goes too far, all of the blood and all the painful hits is just too much for an audience to stand. I think the worse part was that parents brought their kids to see this movie.Besides James Caviezel, no one in this cast speaks english, which i found completely impressive, it just shows the effort that went into this movie, which is why i respect it.25 million dollars to make, which i find amazing, because you figure with all they put into the film. You think it would cost more.DVD Extras- that is the sad part, because i was really hoping for DVD Commentary or something, because there is so much i wanted to find out about this film, but i guess i'm going to have to wait.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2OE3MQZOGCIHR	Guy G. Gustafson	First, let me say that this film will have very little meaning to non-Christians.  It is not a film for children, the squeamish, or for very religious Christians with physically weak hearts.  The film is done entirely in contemporary languages with subtitles.  The film is rated R for the horrific beating Christ receives as His body becomes a bloody vision of tattered flesh.With that said, this film goes beyond a mere movie to become an emotional and religious experience for me.  It seems apparent to me that this is what Mel Gibson intended by utilizing shock violence and gore to emphasize the sacrifice of Christ.  And yet I don't think there's much exaggeration to that violence and gore.  The film is very appropriately titled as it focuses almost entirely on His betrayal by Judas, scourging, condemnation, the carrying of the cross, and crucifixion.  Only several flashbacks by Jesus, and two or three others, and Judas' fate are interruptions.  There are also somewhat disturbing appearances by Satan.I will not say that every Christian needs to see this film...it is a personal choice / limitation.  I know that, eventually, I will own this film, and watch it every Good Friday.	5.0	Lamb of God, Who Takes Away the Sins of the World...	2004-02-29	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1IBQJXZB4P3XE	Guy Olin	"I am writing this review on Good Friday, April 14, 2006. This is the right time to watch the movie. Your DVD player becomes a time machine taking you back in time almost 2000 years.And now you can see everything! Everything, the way it really happened! You become one of those in the crowd and you can see their faces. You can see that some of them are scared; and some of them are like wild animals smelling blood.When I was a child and learned about the crucifixion, I was confused by the fact that Jesus was killed and the Lord did not come to help him. Why did the Lord allow this to happen? In my understanding, God was a superman and He could do everything. I was daydreaming about a mighty angel in shining armor coming from the sky and sweeping away the soldiers and the lynching crowd with his sword of fire. It seemed to me that at some point Jesus expected the same...I understand now that He knew at that time it was not going to happen. The Father, however, had not betrayed Him. The Father, I think now, had something different in mind, and what is most important, the ways of the Father are different. He does not use weapons, armed warriors and military campaigns. In my present understanding, the Lord works through the minds of people and wants people to understand His will and follow it voluntarily.They crucified Him. It was a terrible tragedy! Watching the movie now I sometimes become furious: ""Don't touch Him, you scoundrels! This is our Lord! Our Master! Our hope!..."" But no, they are taking Him away! They will kill Him. There is no hope. We are doomed!Jesus was firm. He defeated the Satan with His spirit. But why was the Satan smiling? He had the crowd. He still has many, many of us.Yes, this is how it happened! This is exactly how they took Him away and crucified Him; almost 2000 years ago. Mel Gibson and the cast have created a miracle.And now, when the end comes and we turn off the time machine, it is good to ask ourselves a very private question:""Was this all in vain?"""	5.0	Was this all in vain?	2006-04-14	18	11	7

I think that if you don't have a close realtionship with Jesus than this movie is perfect for you. But if you already love Jesus than I would not see it.

This film is nothing but some zealot's (Gibson is part of this ultra-orthodox Catholic sect) view of what true Christianity is all about. I'd rather watch Hellraiser VII than re-wating this bloody, boring, organized-religion propaganda. People don't see this film as a film, its more like going to a revival meeting than going to a movie.The dogmatic view of true spiritual enlightenment through pain, death and suffering is nothing more than a means of social control to keep the disenfranchised in line. Historical evidence proves that this whole crucifixion story is suspect. Sadly, people are so hooked on their own suffering as a means of proving their devotion to God that they cannot face a more hopeful and uplifting story of Jesus.But, unlike alot of critics, I don't want to ban this ode to bloodletting. That is the religious fanatic's method of handling something they don't like.  This film is not a Piety test, its simply a poor movie based on a suspect story.God knows what the real story is, I would really like to see a movie based on historical fact rather than a snuff-film designed to scare rubes into rushing back to the church.	2.0	WOW,Look At All That Blood!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3LRVXXVMDNVNM	"Hakuyu ""Ikeda"""	"This film is not the first attempt to portray the Passion of Christ in the film genre. But it is the first time that a film has focused so intensely upon the sheer weight of suffering, compressed into the last twelve hours of Jesus' earthly ministry. In one sense, it astonishing that a film of this type was made in the current era - dominated as it is, media-wise, by largely secular imagery and worldly passion. The challenge was obviously intentional.Mel Gibson put up $25-30 million dollars of his own money to make it. He is, in fact, conservative Catholic (if rumours are correct, conservative enough to prefer the 'Tridentine' Mass)- so, evidently  token of Mel Gibson's faith.Jeff Shannon's staff review/product description for Amazon.com called the film 'unimaginative' - and,in  sense, it is an unimaginative film. Fifty years ago or so, a film like this would have been watched by - and targetted for, audiences with  a predominantly 'Christian' background. For various reasons, that can no longer be assumed. We live in a multi-cultural society, and besides, atheism is far more widespread. Hence, Mel Gibson seems to have pitched the movie to make it seem acceptable as a kind of empirical narrative - a tragic episode, looked at from the outside. There obviously had to be some 'religious' elements in the film, to keep the Christian context, but the 'Christian' narrative remains relatively weak. The only point where the Christian 'mythos' becomes marked - is in the 'Passion' itself. It is shocking - and deeply moving, and that is the primary impact of the film.Perhaps it was one man's (Mel Gibson's) way of saying: ""look how this divine person suffered, for your sake. ""All things considered, given the limited script, Jim Cavaziel played well in the difficult role as the suffering Christ. MaiaMorganstern took her part well, as the Virgin Mary. The occasional use of Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin inthe dialogue, lent an authenticity to the film, historically. Bit of change from Biblical characters with a Bronx accent or Queen's English. However, without engaging in 'triumphalist' postures, as if the whole world had to be Catholic, there were surely moments when the divinity of Christ - and triumph over the cross, needed to be made explicit. As it is, the Passion shows the sufferings of Jesus - as an empirical man, and as such, what we see could well have been the sufferings of any other person, crucified on Golgotha. In this respect, Mel Gibson's seems to have run into interpretetive difficulties. These were evident in other ways - e.g. the alleged 'anti-semitism' which necessitated a modification of scripts. This dilemma faces anyone who wants to present the Passion of Christ, withoutreading Christian belief into it - on the part of the audience. So far as the Christian 'mythos' goes - the crucixion ofJesus is to be rejoiced in, not lamented. The highly empirical,narrative style, adopted by Mel Gibson, shows usthe sufferings, with little sense of the divinity of Christ.In one sense, its like William Wallace, all over again.I watched this film in a Japanese cinema. Some people cried. The over-riding impression seemed to be that this was just a very brutal and tragic event - the 'Passion of Christ' - one more regrettable torture case."	5.0	Graphically moving	2005-03-24	10	8	2

Other apects just left me bewildered.  Why, for instance, is the whole thing shot in Aramaic, while all the actors are white Europeans?  If Gibson was going for realism, to the point of forcing the actors to speak a totally different language, why cast a white Christ when the true Jesus of Nazareth was Middle Eastern?  Getting to more serious points, this film has no emotional depth, no complexity, indeed no real feeling at all.  Jesus, who lived and suffered as a man, with all the complex temptations that human flesh is heir too, is reduced to a Hollywood action hero whose suffering consists of painful scenes of scourging and little else.  The latent, and sometimes not so latent, anti-semitism is coupled with a computer-generated devil that reduced the entire audience where I was to fits of giggles.  Perhaps American audiences are less intellectually demanding about their films but I have to say I came away from this feeling insulted.  If you want to see a moving portrayal of the Christ story find a copy of The Gospel According to Saint Matthew which won the praise of everyone from the Vatican to the Marxist-Christian freedom-fighters in Latin America.

If you are not moved at this movie, you better take another look at your own heart.

Years ago, in a film showing Christ, we never saw His face. Then it was a young and energetic Jeffrey Hunter. A mature and intense Max von Sydow. And so on.

Perhaps a retrospective on what we have become.The production with its originality of concept works well. You would'nt think a film with no english dialogue could hold your attention.

Nothing about the Sermon on the Mount, nothing about what he taught at all. It was all about how he died a gruesome death, an obsession that Gibson puts above everything else.I noticed in the negative reviews of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" that many reviewers expressed enthusiasm for Gibson's film, but hated Scorsese's, which I found a moving examination of what it must have been like for Christ to struggle between the human and divine sides of his nature. (An account based not on the Gospels, as many believed, but upon a thoughtful writer's imagination.)

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A457S8SW690NM	hi	"This movie is an asolute masterpiece. Mel Gibson has trully made an amazing film on the crucifixion of Christ along with his temptations and more. How you rate this movie in my opinion depends on whether or not you are Christian or whether or not you believe in God and Christ's crucifixion. Varg Vikernes needs not to write: ""this weak ass guy carries a cross after hes been tortured."" This man obviously has no faith and for him to diss this movie as well as the bible is unnecessary. Here's a recommendation buddy, if you don't believe in Christ or aern't a Christian, what's the point of watching this movie? And then what's the point of posting a review saying that it's a piece of crap and typical holywood? If you don't have faith, why are you watching this??????? That review really frustrated me. Of course, many of you say that this movie was just made to make money, but I dissagree. I respect the fact that I believe that Gibson made this movie to make a point. All that we see on the screen is exactly what's written in the bible, and for those of you that say that it's too bloody, what about Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan? This movie made me cry but reading this passage in the bible can do the same. The blood was there in the real crucifixion, so why should gibson remove it and make it PG-13 or PG. This is the truth. And the blood there can maybe wake us up and let us realize that Jesus/Christ went through all of thagt pain and suffering for us. For the world. So that we can go to heaven and live in eternal bliss forever. So, the blood level was high because that's what really happened. And if someone were to say that Gibson was trying to make us feel sick, I doubt that because a lot of blood would come out if you got whipped like He did or got nailed to a cross. This movie is a masterpiece and it depicts the truth."	5.0	A masterpiece	2005-06-25	15	5	10
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AD4NE02XEFNUZ	Hilary Nicholls	We should all actually be grateful to Mel Gibson for making this nasty little horror as all he is doing is stating explicitly the horrors that lie within Christianity.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1IYEBTXNWTNLY	Hildee Adams	This is an interested piece of work--definitely made with a lot of dedication and, well, passion for its subject. But people should be aware that Mel Gibson has based his vision on 19th century understandings about the life of Christ. After a hundred years of Jesus scholarship, we actually know more now about the circumstances of his life, including the politics, the religious background, etc., than we've ever known before. But Gibson ignores it all to present his own idiosyncratic conception (again, no pun intended). This is NOT the way it was. If it provokes viewers to learn more about the subject, that's the best we can say for the film.	2.0	Vivid but fictional	2004-10-17	17	8	9
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	The passion has a double face ; the film turns around the last twelve hours in the life of Christ. But I emphasize the initial point ; inner passion and outer passion.In this sense the outer passion runs before your eyes and literally catchs you without no mercy . But beware with the inner passion ; isn't equally important to suggest it?Because if you don't, the balance falls in one extreme and doesn't keep the demanded sense of the passion conceived as a whole process.The outer passion is brilliant depicted , the overlong cruelty of the  images is absolutely unobjectable ; but there are however five aspects which deserve be mentioned.The apex sequence of the film is about the devolution of the thirty silver coins. The pictorical effect reminded me inmediatly to Rembrandt's painting.The another winner sequence concerns with the journey to the Golgota, the camera looks like shy , filled with sorrow and it becomes in another viewer of the painful fact.But the picture has several demerits.The opening sequence was filmed with a clear sense of overshocking the viewer  , you don't feel the logical and progressive sense of anguish and unavoidable fate presence ( Watch Dryer's Joan of Arc, for instance), it is made melodramatically, trying to imposse you feelings that must derivate from the inside to the outside , and the movie goes in opposite direction.The next point to review is the absence of commitment in Monica Belluci's performance , she looks overacted , and lacks of emotional disturbance sense ; Barbara Hershey in this aspect (The last temptation), overpass her.And finally the last sequence in which the camera shows the last moments lack of vivid and expecting realism ; it looks effectist and  show a dissapointed sense of tragedy. In this fact, the death of the hero must offer us an extreme sense of universal earthquake, uncomfortable loss of majesty. cosmical sadness, and a great background of failure mythical inmersed in a ravishing sensation, all the universe must scream, and I emphasize this aspect because the tragedy is a fundamental piece of the universe. The effect is not to the dramatic level expected, the heaven teardrop seemed extremely weak in its inner meaning. The death of Christ demands in this final much more.Gibson made a worthy effort with this movie but he never climbed the high peak of Braveheart.	3.0	A worthy cinematographic work	2004-06-06	11	2	9
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1WN7Y941KA2SS	His Beat Goes On...	I watched The Passion at my church saturday night.  This was the second time.  The first was when it came out and it was a lot to take in.  This time it was different.  It was far more spiritual the second time - a year later.Being done in the language of the day is HUGE.  Both times I saw the movie I got the feeling that I was actually witnessing the day Christ was crucified.  Now when i see movies about Christ that are in English I have trouble connecting with them and somewhat even taking them seriously.I suggest that anyone, who thinks that Christ did not take on the sins of the world, should see this film with an open heart and mind.	5.0	Everything else is now considered cheezy... sorry	2005-03-28	18	12	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1FWNU2JGKUNN5	"H. Jadwani ""Harinder Jadwani"""	I was one of those who was surprised by the extensive critiques of the film as anti-Jewish....believing the film simply reported what was in the Gospels.Many years later, my understanding of the critique has deepened. Christianity has for two millenia treated Jews as responsible for the crucifixion, and utterly rejected Jesus' commandments to Love Thy God with all thy heart, and Love Thy Neigbhour, as well as other important commandments to not embrace Mammon, and not Exalt themselves. The history of Christianity is a history of Hate Thy Neighbour especially the Jewish Ones, and follow Mammon at all costs including the colonization of other nations, the slavery, exploitation and even genocide of their people (eg. the millions of Natives killed in the Americas).How does Gibson's film feed the anti-Jesus practices of Christianity? It focuses on the Church's teachings that Jesus' suffering 'paid' for humanity's sins, so that those who 'believe' in him are 'saved', whereas those who do not, especially the Jews, go to hell. Simply put, Jesus never said or encouraged such absurd notions. On the contrary, he specifically said 'I come NOT to save the world...'. and his parable of the Pharisee and the tax-collector specifically contradicts the arrogance of Christians who imagine they are already 'saved' because they believe in him as the 'universal' Saviour, when he himself contradicted these notions.By focussing morbidly on the beatings, torture, and crucifixion of Jesus, carried out by sadistic Romans, not Jewish priests (who simply wanted him dead), Gibson encourages precisely the wrong teachings of the Church, which Jesus' own statements deny and contradict. No doubt it is based on a sincere effort by Gibson to portray what he has been taught, but those teachings are a distortion of what Jesus himself said. But then it is foolish to expect a Hollywood star - later exposed as an anti-Jew in his arrest in California in a drunken state making rabidly anti-Jewish ravings - to understand, let alone convey, the true teachings of one of the great Masters...	3.0	The problem with Gibson's passion	2008-05-18	5	4	1

The acting is horrible, the music is annoyingly manipulative, and most of the characters have no believability (especially the ""evil Jews""). By the ninety-millionth time Jesus had fallen on his way to Golgotha (filmed in slow-mo, of course), I really stopped caring about any of the caracters. Bathos, anyone? By the time Judas was being chased by the demon childred, I could barely restrain my laughter. Then there was the blood...it was easy to tell that Mel Gibson was getting off on it. The title should read ""The Passion of Jesus's blood, dripping everywhere and covering everything"". If this is his religion, then......Then...there was Satan. Where did he/she/it come from? However, I have to say that, much like Milton in ""Paradise Lost,"" Gibson managed to make Satan the most interesting character in the movie...and he wasn't even mentioned in any of the canonical gospels!I'm sorry I wasted eight dollars on this.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AYSVRHGI9CBB3	Hope	"Having thought about this movie for a long time, I'd imagine that likely - but not necessarily only - practicing Catholics with a strong life of prayer/faith & an advanced handle on the doctrine of the church can get the very max out of this incredible film that should be prayerfully watched (I'd strongly recommend, first and foremost, praying for wisdom BEFORE seeing it, so as to reduce the chance of coming away with a false or superficial understanding of the film).  The reason is because this movie itself transforms into a kind of mystery because of the levity and holiness of its subject and what exactly it is trying to portray to us in great detail.This movie is a work of art in the highest cinematic order, a visual meditation on the Stations of the Cross (as I once heard described on EWTN), and a prayer.  At a church meeting about the movie, I heard it described not so much as ""violent"" as saliently ""brutal"" and I would tend to agree, although the difference between these terms is subtle and yet eventually, intuitively perceptible.  As explained to me, violence - especially Hollywood-style violence - tends to be associated with a kind of chaotic/disorganized action (like something you'd see in ""The Godfather,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Boys in the Hood,"" or ""City of God,"") but brutality is more of a focused action carried out, in this case, toward Jesus.A lot of movies instruct, but no other movie has ever, and probably will ever, make me feel the Passion as this one.  God clearly used Gibson as His instrument to produce this great work and Jim Caveziel's acting - (the very wide range of ideas and emotions portrayed in his gentle face and expressive eyes) - is sublime.  Definitely worth seeing at least once, if not more, in your life.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A330XFRJKS3APU	Igor Biryukov	"What struck me -- Christ was condemned by the ""democratic"" mob, while few ""aristocratic"", more gentle individuals tried to save him. My long suspicion is that mercy is an aristocratic value. Christianity appeals to this ""aristocracy of the spirit"", which is often a gentler spirit. No wonder that many original Christians and early Christian martyrs were women.  You don't need to be a Christian to feel for Christ's suffering so graphically (perhaps too graphically) depicted in the film. It is violent, not hiding behind pretense. It will be disapproved by the modern Western progressives who believe that the human kind is inherently good. They think only a bad governance or dictators (like Hitler or Stalin) make it bad. Actually, Christ's radical message was the reverse. The human nature is seriously tinted. Special effort is needed to make us love one-another -- not somebody of the same tribe or family - that would be easy, but the enemy. How is it even possible? We are to love all men in spite of the fact they are sinners partially because we know we are sinners ourselves. This message is radically different from the organized systems of self-righteousness embodied in nationalism, religious camps, and political parties. They would not hesitate to crucify Christ again. Christianity never ceased challenging human illusions. The best of it preaches religion of the spirit, other-worldly, preaching charity and humility, trusting Providence and submitting to it, and setting its heart and its treasure in heaven. Whereas other heroes may imagine they can liberate the whole humankind, Christ was more concerned with individual human souls. And there is a question of mercy and the state. Seems to me, mercy is an aristocratic value, it is opposite to the self-righteousness and drive for revenge, which are the things of democratic mob. I'm deeply skeptical about the ability of modern state apparatus to understand its enemy, or even the ally, because the state has already rendered judgement as to the purity of its own intentions. I'd probably have preferred myself a less brutal, slightly more gentle and nuanced film, but I think this one is very good, powerful film."	5.0	Christ asserts 'aristocratic' values versus 'democratic' mob	2013-10-10	6	2	4

Then, I began hearing how controversial it was, being criticized by the Jewish Community, and sanctioned by the Vatican, among others.  And everyone was discussing it.  So I thought I better see it.I'm not sure what I was expecting, as I had not read any reviews, or talked with anyone who had seen the movie yet, but I got both more, and less, than what I expected.  The ""less"" was that I was subjected to the extreme horror of Christ's torture, but for NO PAYOFF in the end!  The movie shows Christ tortured to death, and being put in his tomb, and then (...) The audience has to watch Christ being beaten to a pulp, and the horrors of his crucifiction, up-close, and in graphic detail.  I was left with an empty feeling at the end, wondering exactly what was the point, and wondering why Mel Gibson made this movie.  I have heard that his point was to show that ALL of mankind was responsible for Christ's death, but his movie did not get that point across to me.The ""more"" of the movie was I enjoyed all the authenticity.  Both my husband and I enjoyed listening to to the Latin and Aramaic.  I had heard that Aramaic was in the same language family as both Arabic and Hebrew, and we were surprised to find that we could understand some words in the Aramaic language (we live in Morocco).  I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of Pontious Pilate's character.  I give Mel Gibson an A+++ for authenticity in every aspect of the movie.  But unfortunately, both my husband and I entirely missed the whole point of the movie.I had SO looked forward to seeing this movie, and discussing it with friends.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3ABEO1BQZ7F34	Inkgirl08	This film is polarizing, as it should be. Jesus is controversial. This film is brilliant.It ceases to be a film and instead transforms itself into an experience. It is as if the viewer is there witnessing the crucifixion. I thought Gibson's choice to film it in Aramaic and Latin to be a brilliant one. You almost didn't need the subtitles--the beautiful sounds of the language gives it authenticity and is strangely easy to understand. The acting was intense.I was expecting it to be brutal after all the talk...it was terribly brutal but to make it easy to watch would be demeaning and inaccurate. Roman beatings were known to sometimes rip a man in half and it is noted in the scriptures that afterwards he was hardly identifiable as a man. We have to know the horror He endured. Other films about historical subjects like slavery and the holocaust show horrors without controversy and I am perplexed about the uproar. This really happened to real people, executions throughout history have been extremely grotesque. Whether you believe in Him or not, you will now know what Christians mean when they say He died for your sins.This film is about His death and resurrection. It lets you experience it as if you were there. It is not meant to be about his entire ministry. I think it succeeds on an artistic level as well theological.

I don't know if one will ever superceede it. It'll be tough.The Passion follows the last days of Jesus on earth and is an accurate portrayal of Jesus as he's seen in the gospels. Of course, there is a dispute in New Testament scholarship as to whether or not Jesus said and did many of the things the gospels attribute to him. Putting that debate aside for a second, Mr. Gibson does a realistic job (really, there was a lot of blood in this film) of showing us the Jesus whom Christians believe was divine, redeeming humankind and putting it right with G-d.Whatever the nature of Jesus was, as well as the New Testament texts, you'll find this film extremely moving. It could be a powerful account of G-d acting in history or a celebration of the human religious imagination.Also recommended: How to Lose Your Faith in Divinity School	4.0	For the strong-stomached only	2005-09-19	7	7	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A34FSS6DNL1UJ	"""iriley1979"""	"It disturbs me that so many people like this movie as much as they do. Yes it is well made and well directed, but it reminds me of a really bloody child's tale. Except for the fact that it is so violent, it could easily be a kid's movie. It is so simple; none of the complexities of Jesus' life and statements are examined at all. This movie should just be called ""The Torture of Jesus"". ""Or Jesus got it really, really, really bad."" Or ""Jesus had a lot of blood, want to see it all?"" Really, think about how SIMPLE this movie was, no ambiguity, no in depth discussion of his teachings and his often (seemingly) contradictory statements. Every statement Jesus makes is non political, and non controversial, except of course for when he says ""those who brought me to you bear the greater sin."" Meaning of course the Jews bear the greater sin. Other than that we get a very dumbed down version of Jesus and his teachings, ""the wine is my blood, the bread is my flesh, etc."" No statements from Jesus regarding how hard it is for rich people to get into heaven (paging Mel Gibson, paging Mel Gibson) or how he thought money lenders were bad etc. Would Jesus really want a movie made about him that focused this exclusively and morbidly on his death? Why not do a movie on the life of Jesus? That is much more important than his death, his teachings, wanderings, etc. But that movie would not sell nearly as many tickets as this movie will and that brings us to the truth about this movie and the crux of the matter. This movie is nothing but an excuse for people to watch someone get tortured and rationalize it as a religious, spiritual experience, a vehicle by which an average person can indulge in sadism and write it off as religious education. There is no way this movie would ever be viewed as anything but a big budget torture flick if Jesus were not the one being tortured. Think about it, is that not the only reason it is o.k. For normal people to enjoy this movie, because it is Jesus getting tortured, not someone else? Do people really like this movie so much because it is so spiritual and religious, or because it is so bloody and sick? Honestly, everyone who is reading this knows I am right even if they do not want to admit it, the main attraction here is not Jesus or Christianity, it is torture and blood. I guarantee that if this movie where mostly about Christ's life, and did not focus almost exclusively on his death it would not be nearly as successful. This movie is nothing but a sadomasochistic experience thinly disguised as a religious experience. I saw this movie with a crowd full of glazed eyed fanatics who looked to me like they were getting of on Jesus' treatment, while convincing themselves they were ""getting closer to god"". Please, if anything this movie was Satanic in its meticulous, detailed, and yes, loving attention to each facet of Jesus' torture. If you like watching suffering, you will love this movie! The official Amozon.com reviewer, the always dependably disingenuous establishment intellectual Jeff Shannon, (do us all a favor and retire, PLEASE!!) review differed only from the rest of the wild eyed Gibson's cult's reviews in its sophistication and veneer of objectivity. Mel Gibson was so brave to make this film, oh we should admire his aplomb, his refusal to bow to convention, his spiritual and intellectual independence, I am getting teary eyed just thinking about his pure motives in making this movie! Give me a break! Gibson is a fanatic with an agenda and the money to finance it. However, this is America and just like everyone else he has the right to make any sort of movie he wants, I am no censor, and do not advocate banning this film. That being said, I do not think Gibson deserves admiration simply for being controversial as our intellectual guru Mr. Shannon seems to think, by that standard the KKK would also deserve admiration. He has a right to make this film, but that does not make him brave, just fanatical. Now on to the most important and dangerous part of this movie, the anti-Semitism. This movie is anti-Semitic, perhaps not as much as advertised, but there are defiantly Jewish stereotypes in here. All the Jews that love Jesus are normal looking and nice, all the ones that do not love Jesus are seedy, ugly, scheming, and scum. And for those who think this movie is not anti-Semitic just read some of the reviews written by anti-Semites praising this movie and then tell me I am wrong. Gibson's father has stated that the Holocaust never happened and Gibson supports that statement of his father's. There is nothing intellectually challenging about this movie at all, Jesus got horribly tortured, the Jews were responsible, enjoy the torture while faking disgust, then blame the Jews for everything. Pretty convenient for viewers huh? They do not have to think, they get to be entertained and indulge their unspeakable desires, then get to turn around and blame it all on someone else, thereby displacing the guilt you feel for enjoying this film in the first place.Rich fanatical Christians are buying up blocks of tickets and giving them away for free!!! What other movie in history has had people do that. That alone shows that this movie has a serious agenda. The characters in this movie lack depth and so does the film itself. I guarantee that this movie will become a cult hit for anti-Semites and religious nuts just like Gibson himself. If you do not believe me, just wait and see!!!"	3.0	A movie every religious wacko and anti-semite will love!	2004-03-04	24	7	17
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	irnmtn25	"Last Saturday, I finally got to see this film...and ever since then...I have been thinking about how I was going to write this review.  Now, I feel ready to write....MAJOR PERFORMANCES:  I think that Jim Caviezel did a pretty fine job as Jesus.  He made the torture and suffering of Christ come to life...conveying the point across as best as he could.  Of course, he had the strongest performance in the film.  However, Mary's (the mother) performance cannot be overlooked.  She did a good job of showing a mother's love for her son....and she brings the ""human side"" of Jesus to the fore.  Others in the film also put in outstanding performances....showing the great political and social upheaval of that period.  The Romans were depicted as people occupying a territory that they didn't really care about.  Gibson chose to show the old Roman glory through Pilate...and the coming decadence (and eventual downfall of the Empire) through Herod.  Whether this is historically accurate could be questioned.  The high priests of the Jewish temple were rightly depicted (in how they acted and their fear/power struggle with Jesus and the disciples)....even though I could see some lending to anti-semitic feeling through their dress and how they were shown as power-hungry political types.  There is a fine line being drawn...it is easy to cross at times....and Gibson tends to straddle it at times throughout the film where it concerns the Jews.THOUGHTS:  Yes, this movie was rather a bloody one.  Yes, some of the scenes (such as the cross being dropped so many different times) are a bit overdrawn at times.  Yes, the supernatural bits (the wolf-thing visiting Judas) were a bit confusing.  However, Gibson has intention in this.  If he made a sugar-coated movie, then no one would talk about it.  His whole intention with this film was to show how Jesus died for our sins in such a horrific way as to make people stop in their tracks and start questioning their beliefs and faith.  To me, if people walked out of the theater and asked at least one question about spirituality, faith, Christianity, Jesus, etc., then Gibson's goal was realized.  And, in that, wasn't this movie ultimately successful?  I think this movie is the closest thing to the real suffering that Christ endured, and I think it will be a long time for it is matched....if ever.I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  However, I would warn people that if they are sensitive to horrific situations, or if they are mulling over questions concerning Jesus in their spiritual life....make sure to bring some tissues and be prepared for a lot of thought and introspection after the lights come back on.  If I was a parent, I would not bring my child to this movie unless they were prepared to handle it. Otherwise, for a believer or one questioning their beliefs, it is not just a movie...but an experience.  You'll be thinking about it for a long time after...."	5.0	Thought provoking....	2004-04-15	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A15UXO3PDUOGJY	Ironblayde	"It's easy to understand why there has been so much talk about this film. As far as I'm aware, the Passion has never been portrayed quite like this, and for the Christian, the film is worth seeing for that reason alone. Gibson is a skilled director, and the cast does a commendable job as well.That said, I felt it was far too narrow in scope. Aside from a few brief flashbacks to well-known Biblical scenes, ""Passion"" focuses almost exclusively on the torture Jesus suffered at the hands of the Romans. I make no exaggeration when I say that this is very probably the most violent film ever made. Jesus' punishment prior to his cruicifixion is so overwhelmingly brutal that had it been as severe as ""Passion"" portrays, it certainly would have killed him, and Gibson doesn't spare the audience one bit of it. As I sat in the theater waiting for the film to begin this morning, I kept hearing conversations around me about who should go get the popcorn and Skittles, and it struck me as incongruous to the point of being ludicrous. This is not a film you watch for entertainment. If you find it difficult to watch scenes of extreme violence, consider carefully before seeing ""Passion."" Do not take your children.Because of its very narrow focus, I think that the appeal of ""Passion"" is rather limited. To the Christian looking for a far more visceral experience of the Passion than one is likely to find in church, if you can handle the violence, this film is likely to be a uniquely powerful experience. To the non-Christian, however, this is little more than the tiresome experience of watching a man endure torture for over two hours. Jesus' teachings of peace take a back seat to exceedingly gruesome depictions of his suffering, and ""Passion"" doesn't provide anything new as far as content goes; that is to say, it doesn't challenge us to look at Jesus from another perspective, as did Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" which I feel is a far superior film.On a somewhat related note: there have been allegations of anti-Semitism in this film, but I believe they are mostly unfounded. If the Jewish high priests were rather forceful about their demands for his punishment, that's nothing new, and a group of priests doesn't speak for every follower of Judaism, no more than religious figures of today, both respected and infamous, represent the thoughts of every follower of their respective religions.In summary, though ""Passion"" is a well-made film, it falls rather short of what it could have been. It is viscerally stimulating, but not intellectually so, and offers nothing for people who aren't already sincere followers of Christianity."	3.0	Well made, but not without its flaws	2004-02-29	4	1	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2PF96JR7Z01ZP	"Isaac Ho ""Isaac Ho"""	I viewed this film the other night when I had nothing better to do. The film is passable but it is too graphic, particularly the scenes depicting the scourging of Christ.I think this worst than third degree torture is purely cinematic and has no relevance at all in the punitive sentence accorded to Christ Himself.Reviewing the sourging scenes in more leisure time, I think Jesus would have died than and there with such  cruel method that was used on him.  This coupled with lack of sleep, drinking water and eating, he would not be able to even walk straight up and much less carry the heavy wooden cross at all!I think the picture is rather an exaggeration and too graphic to convince me  as a Christian. Well...who am I to urge the commercial techniques used by Hollywood. On the whole, the film is better than the fabrication and untruth betrayal of our Lord Jesus Christ in other later films about him by Hollywood which are tantamount to insult of Christianity and a great affront to the truth of Jesus Christ - saviour of mankind.	2.0	Too graphic to Christians...!	2007-03-31	13	0	13

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1RVF43G6YKDTK	"Ismail Elshareef ""ielshareef"""	As a believer in Jesus' prophecy, this film was as disturbing as it was sobering for me. Speaking Arabic helped me understand almost 80% of the Aramaic dialogue, which sounded eerily familiar and haunting. To me, the movie was mostly about the perennial ingratitude and denial that humanity never failed to afford the Messengers of God. That specific aspect of the film profoundly moved me for that it was depicted so very vividly, and sadly, accurately.Muslims do not believe in Jesus' crucifixion. They believe that he ascended to Heaven in his earthly form before his alleged capture. His betrayer, Judas, was then transformed by God to look like Jesus. Judas (looking like Jesus) was captured and crucified and in turn purifying his soul from the mortal sin of betrayal. Muslims believe in Jesus' miraculous birth yet they don't believe in his divinity, which is one of the major differences between Islam and Christianity.Having said that, the crucifixion scenes were still excruciating and barely bearable to watch. The very fact that human beings were ever capable of devising something so barbaric and inhuman like the crucifixion mechanism or the flogging tools is so unfathomable to me. It's ironic to say that we've come a long way in a time where innocent blood is still getting shed in the most gruesome ways in the name of God.The arrogance and defiance of the High Priests in the film and their determination to eliminate Jesus brought so many allegations that the movie was anti-Semitic. I disagree. I believe that the High Priests at the time of Jesus were so corrupt and venal that they were enraged and defiant in the face of a man claiming to be God's Prophet and wanting to bring about change. Jesus posed a threat to the way the Priests lead their political and religious lives and to the control they had on the lives of those around them. He was a threat that had to be eliminated. Sounds familiar?What many people fail to understand is that Prophets came in times when the majority of people were in dire situations living lives full of deceit, betrayal, corruption, injustice, debauchery and lack of spirituality. Prophets came to bring people back to God and to show them the way of living a joyful life. Prophets were never greeted with cheers and hugs once they started to spread the message of God. They were all persecuted and tortured in one way or another. It's part of our human history and our failure to believe in God's words. I see the movie as a true testament to the ingratitude of all of humanity, not the Jewish Priests or the Jewish people.One of the most mesmerizing portrayals in this film was that of Satan. He was portrayed as a gender-unspecific, haunting character that is almost as beautiful as it is repulsive. It truly captured the essence of evil: a rotten core engulfed by a layer of deceptive beauty.At a time when so many anti-religion films and programs permeate our cultures, this film brings to the forefront a visual of a historical episode of our defiance toward God and his Prophets. It truly pronounces our collective eternal lack of faith in God. To me, that was very sobering, especially now that God and faith are ridiculed and disparaged on daily basis. I guess we haven't changed that much, have we?I recommend this film to adults of all races, religions and cultural backgrounds. Even if you have a different take on the historical accounts of Jesus' life, the film will open your heart to see history from the perspective of one of the world's great religions. It will also urge you to contemplate on the history of the Messengers of God and on God himself.If there is a time for Jesus' return, it has got to be now. Corrupt politicians, fanatic religious authorities, decadent cultures, alienated religions, and imminent self-destruction are all signs of a time humanity is in desperate need for a savior; a savior that will once and for all put an end to the endless feud between religions and cultures and races and souls; a savior that will deliver humanity from itself to a better world where the name of the game is love and empathy for all.	5.0	The Passion of the Christ: A Muslim&#65533;s Perspective	2004-03-02	5	4	1

If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message, love, pacificm, or teachings, it's a sensationalist view of his suffering, which doesn't fit well with the Christ story.	1.0	An affront to Christ	2004-10-01	94	49	45
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2GBNMYG9P9KCM	Ixx	I went to see this film for two reasons - I wanted to see if the film really went a far as it did with the violence (and in my opinion, it was nearly as violent as I expected), and for the fact that there's not one word of spoken English. Everything is in Aramaic or Latin, which gives it a kind of authenticity and naturalism that the other movies based in this time period just don't have.What I really liked, however, was the fair portrayal of Pilate. He wasn't the Roman monster everyone likes to make him out to be (for the simple reason that the Romans followed a Pagan religion - there's prejudice for ya). He was rational, yet firm in that he did what he had to do - HIS JOB. Pilate wasn't a Jew, and therefor didn't [care] about Jesus's messiah preachings. It was Pilate's job to govern the people and keep the peace. And because Rome was a Republic at the time, it followed the will of majority - and the majority wanted Jesus dead. So that's what Pilate did. This DOES NOT make Pilate a lemming - he did then what politicians don't do now - what the people want them to do.I highly recommend this film to those who have a fascination with the Roman time period or etymology - or with violence.... and more than plenty of it. I can't say I recommend this to Jesus Freaks - I gurantee you WILL be offended and disgusted. However, if you have a strong stomach, and can maturely sit through a movie such as this, it is a work of art.	4.0	....why lie? i saw it for the violence - and the languages	2004-03-24	1	1	0

The flashbacks and the synthesis of the scenes, e.g., the washing of Pilate's hands before submitting Jesus to be crucified to Jesus washing his hands before offering up the bread for the last supper, were intrinsically done and cleverly executed.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	This film might not be an everlasting masterpiece, but it definitely is a disquieting film. One thing has to be said first : this Passion is based on Saint John's Gospel and I have not been able to read that in any paper or magazine. At the same time the film gives many flashbacks that integrates elements from other moments into the story, for example the Last Supper which is not included in Saint John's Passion. The impersonification of the devil is maybe debatable though Gibson avoids any horns and other antics and uses a young character who looks like a man, though he is a woman, so we learn in the cast of the film, and this character is in a way disquieting because he looks very young, handsome and attractive among people who are definitely berserk in many ways. The great value of this film is that Gibson tries to show what this passion really was : sadistic torture and mass-frenzy manipulated by the strong desire from the High Priest, that is to say the dominating group of a theocratic state or government, to get rid of someone who represented a danger for their power. They are only motivated by political selfish reasons and they manipulate the crowd, the people even, the Romans too, into doing what they want them to do and do not have the courage or the authority to do themselves. This aspect is definitely present in  Saint John's Gospel and we cannot say this is antisemitic : this is a criticism of a group of autocratic rulers. The fact that they are Jewish does not change the fact. Criticizing them does not mean that all the Jews are bad and responsible for the crime. What's more, Gibson uses another element that is not present in any Gospel, to know the fact that some members of the Council were against the decision and the procedure, showing that we had a real debate on that issue, though not a democratic debate at all. Gibson is also very moderate on some of the torture and violence because either he does not really show the acts or he avoids some acts that are common place in such a situation. Finally Gibson is trying to show that any society tortures and even kills those they consider as dangers for them and that this happens still today, and even in our own societies, even if torturing is more psychological and economic than physical. The main idea that comes out of this film is that anyone has to fight, to the death if necessary, for what one believes to be true. In other words I will say this film, no matter how gruesome it is and how gruesome it may have been if realism had been the only objective, is a good film, and a film that should be shown to people, particularly young people, who don't seem to know that it is difficult and at times dangerous to defend one's ideas and beliefs.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	5.0	The Passion for our beliefs may lead to death	2004-04-08	4	4	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3VY1QHFJF0Y7H	"J. Adams ""History buff"""	"I normally don't write reviews of movies since I don't go to see many of them because they are usually such nonsensical Hollywood crap. But after reading a couple hundred reviews of this DVD, I couldn't resist adding my two cents.I did see the movie when it first came out, and I bought several copies of the DVD for myself and family members because it is truly a transformational piece of artistry and guidance of how to conduct your life for the short time we get to inhabit the planet. Most of the comments I read did not actually deal with the importance of Gibson's contribution to civilization.Jesus was an important contributor to the advancement of civilization because he did something that is so rare in human events. He was willing to die for changing a corrupt world and make it more loving, accepting, and inclusive.  Religion has always been a force for good and evil because it is used by those who want to advance their own agenda rather than that of the originator of a particular religion. This is true whether the focus was worshiping fire, water, cows, snakes, a human individual, and many other idols. Humans are different from our fellow apes because we actually try to understand the unknowable of why we are here, and what we should do in guiding us now that we are capable of more than just sitting around a fire cooking the day's catch.  Muhammad's words are used as an excuse for jihad by lunatics who kill randomly and wantonly to advance their view of the Koran to kill any ""nonbelievers"". The high priests of the temple of David were threatened by a ""blasphemer"" when he pointed out the violation of having money changers in the temple. The high priests in Spain and medieval Europe roasted other ""blasphemers"" in violation of the words of the Christ they supposedly worshiped as their God.What Gibson does with his work is to point out that we all have a choice, actually many choices in life, to choose the path of forgiveness and love of our fellow man, regardless of how they have violated any sense of humanity towards our fellow man, or go the way of Rome at the time of Jesus (or Berlin and Moscow in the 30's and 40's). It is really the only thing that makes us different from our ancestors who climbed down from the trees millions of years ago and moved all over the planet. I find it especially telling that those who watch something like the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and don't feel a need to write a review about such gratuitous violence can give a one star to a movie which is focused on the horrible suffering of scourging and crucifixion two millennia ago of someone who preached honesty, love, compassion, forgiveness, and inclusiveness when the ruling order of the day was sacrificing goats for signs of divine guidance.This is one of the real classics of movie making. It is not for the faint of heart, because dying for the sins of your fellow man is a rare event. No other major religion is based upon such a selfless individual. It is why it has transformed the world from one of Conan the barbarian and his predecessors and successors to one where we think of something other than ourselves and our selfish human passions. Of course humans being humans, the forces of evil are on the march, as exemplified by the suicide bombings in Israel, Ossetia, New York, Washington, Bali, Kenya, Tanzania, Yemen, Germany, etc.Gibson deserves every dime he was rewarded with for reminding us of the transformational nature of the message of Jesus the Jew to mankind. Whether you think of Jesus as the Christ or not, you cannot find a better advocate for all the principles that we take for granted today in the West, including those on the upper West Side or West Hollywood who have never done anything but shoot their mouths off while hundreds of thousands have given their blood and bodies for mankind. Every time I walk among the thousands of crosses in American cemeteries all over Europe, and especially in places like Normandy, where brave young men gave their lives, not for conquest or commercial gain but so that others could be free, I understand their sacrifice and the appropriateness of marking it with the symbol of what Christ did to inspire all of mankind. This movie shows you how it all started and what a magnificent gift of selflessness it was."	5.0	A story of how one man changed the world	2004-09-05	6	3	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A313H6238N589	"Jaewoo Kim ""OB-Wan"""	As an Asian American male, I can objectively state this movie is highly anti-simitic. Quite frankly, I have no idea what people were looking at when they wholeheartedly claim this movie has no anti-jewish theme. Here are few I found quite objectionable because the biblical account of Jesus's death has been twisted to place the blame of his cruxifiction solely on the Jews.1)Pontius Pilate tries to save Jesus and is portrayed as the good guy. He is not an objective and ruthless Roman governor, but a man who is interested in the truth of Jesus's teachings. Three separate times, he tries to save Jesus's life. First, when the Pharisees and the Jews bring battered Jesus to him , he actually complains that they beat him even though he is yet to be convicted of guilt. Then, refusing to condemn the man, he sends him to Herod. When Herod sends Jesus back (again not finding him guilty), Pilate again tries to save Jesus by giving the Jews a choice to save him. The Jews, of course, chooses to save Barabas instead. Then the Pilate tries to save Jesus AGAIN by just beating and flogging Jesus, hoping it will quell the Jew's anger, the Jews rejects Pilate pleading that Jesus had suffered enough punishment and should be set free. The Jews, and only the Jews, demands Jesus be cruxified.2)The high ranking Pharisees are seen beating Jesus with their bare hands. This scene was utterly ridiculous because it was an equivalent of a Pope beating a Jew with his bare hands(which may have actually happened few hundred years back). Not only is this scene unbiblical, but historically unlikely. The Pharisees were very picky about who and what they touched. A blasphemer was considered unclean and untouchable, especially by pharisees, and beating Jesus with their bare hands broke their own strict rules.I found it disturbing that few twists of the story were all catered to blaming the Jews. In this, I found it even more disturbing than Jesus's death itself. He did die, after all, as a practicing Jew.	2.0	Highly Anti-Simitic	2004-09-18	27	14	13

I could bet all my belongings that anyone who now wears a cross as a trend, and watches this movie, will think twice about it. Or even better, wear it because they believe!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AEB3NSRYXP1AQ	Jake	I will try not to hide behind insults, name-calling, or any other nonsense I have seen while reading reviews of this movie.The main problem I have with 'The Passion of the Christ' is that it is a wide-scale attempt to achieve what white Europeans have been attempting to do for the last thousand or so years. What is this thing that they have been attempting to achieve? Hegemony, power over other peoples. The main way this has been done is through Christianity. Missionaries would come into villages of Mayans, Africans, Native Americans, Indians, or Asians, and try to 'save' them with the power of Christ. However, what these missionaries were actually doing was destroying the unique and varied beliefs of these peoples by dictating that their customs were 'savage'. It is this destruction of culture that has created a huge problem for me in my life. I have often had a hard time coming to terms with my Christianity because I know what people have done in the name of Christ. Throughout the last 2000 years, Christ's suffering has been used to justify the slaughtering of Muslims, Jews, and other cultures, and basically the westernazation of most of the world. I remember one year watching the Grammys and seeing a Native American man thanking Christ for helping him create this album of traditional tribal chants, and thinking that almost all Native Americans have been taught to respect their culture, but at the same time realizing that Christ is real and the belief system of their culture is not.Back to the Passion- basically this movie is attempting to apply scare tactics to convince more people to become 'saved' by Christ. It guilt trips the viewer to think that it is because of him that these horrible things are happening, and that he or she is a terrible person for letting this happen to Christ, while an accurate cinematic depiction of the Crusades would have had a larger number of people going through things that either equal or exceed the pain and the suffering that Jesus is going through in 'The Passion'.Now, it is easy to say that 'The Passion' was targeted just at a Christian audience to remind them over Lent about the suffering of Christ. Why then was this movie so heavily marketed, and why did Mel Gibson swirl up so much of a controversy? Just looking at the amount of money this movie made at the box office it is easy to see that Mel Gibson did not just intend this movie for a Christian audience. In fact, I distinctivly remember Mel Gibson encouraging everyone to see this film, such as Michael Moore did with his latest 'Farenheit 9/11'.So here is my message to the consumer- Please if you really want to see this movie, keep in mind that it is one man's opinion, and you should not be pressured into feeling guilty over Christ's death if you do not already feel so. Keep a level head while watching this movie and do not come to any rash conclusions about how guilty this movie made you feel.	1.0	Disturbing, disgruntling, disgusting	2004-08-20	122	29	93
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AM0B12DY6A2QH	"JAL ""jlwest"""	In a discussion I had with a friend about this movie, I complained that there didn't seem to be much to ground the suffering of Jesus in any kind of philosophy or lifestyle or teachings, something that would make the suffering be of interest. The suffering seemed kind of pointless to me, without the religious philosophy behind it. But the friend argued that the teachings of Jesus didn't matter at all, the only thing that mattered was the suffering Jesus endured while being crucified. Well, maybe that explains why Mel Gibson and American fundamentalists are lock-step on this story. It's a Passion Play without any passion, without any story and without any depth - it stays right at the surface, which is, I guess, where the director believes it belongs. This is literally a movie that is skin-deep - especially if you mean flayed skin, and HEEPS OF BLOOD. A bad movie not because it's shocking but because it's shallow and, despite the blood, it is terribly dull and terribly thin.	1.0	Disappointing	2005-01-14	29	11	18

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3F3B6HY9RJI04	James Duckett	Christ, the greatest person to ever live, who had come to Earth to die for our sins, is the subject of this movie.  It shows the suffering that Christ had to endure at the wish of his Father in heaven to complete his part in the plan of our salvation.  It shows that Christ was willing to do whatever it took that we may have the opportunity to repent of our sins.This is not for young children, as I was shocked to see many kids at the theater.  Wait until they can handle the torture depicted in this film as it is severe and it is gruesome.  There is no doubt that this movie deserves its R rating.  I was expecting worst, from all the talk, but other than the driving of the nails I was able to handle it just fine.  I point this out only because I have a rather weak stomach and I just had to turn my head at that part.Watching the film in the two languages of the time added authenticity to the film.  I didn't mind reading the subtitles and I thought that it only made it more powerful.This film did not strike me as being anti-Jewish, an accusation that seems to be helping this film more than it is hurting it.  It was often shown that Jesus died at his own accord as he could have saved himself at any time but choose to die that we may be saved.As the credits started going up there wasn't a dry eye in the theater.  It was gripping and it was powerful.  I highly recommend this movie that you may see what Jesus Christ had to go through for us.Mel Gibson had hinted at doing other Biblical features.

Most people don't cry during church...unless ur a crazy pentecostal! (jk) But really its sad that we have films convert people to christianity that contain such hatreds of jews.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A18I8EYPJK3XMA	James H. McDuffie	This is a fantastic movie that captures the last hours of Christ's existence on Earth.  It is extremely violent and not suitable for children.  There are flaws however.  First, this movie portrays a very medieval view of Christ.  Second, the movie captures several unverifiable myths about the death of Christ.  The roles of Pontius Pilate and his wife for instance.  The bible tells us some but the movie goes much farther-probably too far.  However, to create a reasonably complete story I do not see another choice for the author of the movie. Some have said that the movie is only about the physical suffering of Christ but I personally found this to be much less true than I was led to believe by other reviewers.  The emotional torture was greatly apparent to me and also, I believe, to others approaching this movie with an open mind.  I personally am a Christian but I was a little disturbed by some things I saw at the theatre.  Is this a Christian jerk-off movie/snuff movie?  Not in general but it seemed to be for a small minority.  Overall, I believe the movie is appropriate if the people watching understand what they are watching for the movie attempts to portray Jesus dying for our sins.  But, and this is a big but.  No matter how horrible they portray the death of Jesus it just simply cannot be captured on film.  Jesus suffered all the suffering of mankind while he was on the cross and there is just no way to show it.  The other problem which bothered me was that some, despite the R rating and the extreme violence, thought the movie would help their small children understand what Jesus did for them.  This upsets me and shows that the movie has potential for abuse.  Overall, this was a superlative effort.  In the final analysis at least one more movie should be made showing the rest of the life of Jesus.  That is all that is remiss.	5.0	But where is the rest of it?	2004-03-08	6	1	5

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1JOTUT2XOUZFG	"James Kilgour ""JimboOfTheShire"""	Both my Dad and I were eager to see this movie, while neither of us are religious. i had heard all the trouble this movie had stirred because of its violent depiction of the crucifixion. I knew it was going to be a violent film, but nothing could have prepared me for the movie I was about to witness.I wouldnt even call it a movie. It is a violent, bothering and truly moving experience. I have no shame in admitting that I cried at this film, not once, but frequently. There were times where I had to turn away, I simply could not watch it. It wasnt just the violence that bothered me, it was so unbelievably upsetting, watching Christ suffer. I am no stranger to violence and torture (in movies anyway!!!), and I have never turned away from a film. I did during The Passion of the Christ.Despite the violence, this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever watched. I originally was not looking forward to the fact that it was in subtitles, due to it being in multiple languages (but not English), but the film would not have been the same if it were in English, not as realistic as it was. All actors in this movie were on top form, Jim Cavaziel put in a performance like nothing I have ever seen. I know this film was never made to gain any Oscars or other awards, but by God it deserves some.One of the things in this movie that I really liked was how everyone was affected by Jesus when he would look them in the eyes, or speak to them. This really suggested that he was more than human.The music was very powerful, and added to the film's sense of tragedy. Overall, an unbelievable film, which does not follow the normal pattern of a film, in that the events of Jesus' betrayal and capture took place almost immediately. Again, an unbelievable, brutal yet very beautiful piece of film making. One for all people to see, if they are emotionally able to sit through it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A39VJRIW7HC5C0	James Kunz	What is the importance of Christ's final twelve hours on earth?  Sure he suffered, no one could deny that after watching the film, but so have millions of normal people.  In order to make a good movie about Jesus Christ one must explain WHY he suffered and what the overarching effect of his suffering are, not just show his torture.  Gibson fails to do this, focusing only on the pain Christ suffered and not what he did with his life, which is far more important.  In addition, his direction is very poor, utilizing obscene amounts of slow-motion that would have seemed gratuitous in a sports movie, let alone an epic.  Furthermore, the use of Aramaic and Latin has no real point beyond being pretentious, and the inclusion of Satan is unnecceasary and somehwat off-putting.  A decent film, but could have been done better.So far I have only focused on the film itself, as if it was adapted from a gruesome best-seller and not the bible (although one could argue they're one and the same).  As to the claims of antisemitism, I must say that the Jews are presented in a very negative light, going to all measures to exact awful justice on Jesus while Pontius Pilot is presented very sympathetically.  I would like to say a few things about Jesus and the Jews.1- According to Christianity, Jesus came to earth to die for the sins of mankind.  Therefore, blaming the Jews for his death is contradictory.2- If God is all-powerful and all-knowing, then certainly he could have saved Jesus if he wanted to and didn't because Jesus was supposed to die3- Jesus, in the eyes of the Jews, was a heretic, and the Christians have certianly done their fair share of persecuting heretics.Although to be honest not all the Jewish people are portrayed badly, and knowing Mel Gibson and his father (a Holocaust denier), things could have been much worse.  However, while I am not Jewish, I am sick and tired of people villifying them for the death of Christ, and there was no need to make Pontius Pilot so pious and the Jewish leaders so megamanical.  5/10	3.0	Style but no substance	2004-10-29	18	10	8

If you are looking for a film for the whole family to enjoy or someone needs to learn about the story of Jesus, this movie is not the one to see. The Passion of the Christ (2004) only shows the last 12 hours of Christ's life, so if you already know the whole story of Jesus and his wonderful miracles, then I would say, yes, to seeing this film by Mel Gibson.  The Passion of the Christ (2004) does not contain any of the miracles.  If you do not already know Jesus, you will be confused.  Bravo to actor, Jim Caviezel.  I was thinking that Mel Gibson just wanted to make a gross, bloody film, however I do respect Mr. Gibson for his ability to show realism.  For my daughter to see, it was too much (she left the theater for awhile).  For my mother, it was also too much.  I can respect this film, however I still believe for a beautiful, educational, in-depth, emotional and dramatic story of Jesus (without bloody gore),his entire life and miracles, it would be better to see Jesus of Nazareth (1977) starring Robert Powell.Mel Gibson released a new version of his film in 2005, now titled, ""The Passion of The Christ: Recut"".

He confronted accusations of excessive violence and anti-Semitism. In my astronomy paper, I prove that God does not exist. But the Holy Spirit reveals that God does exist. I had a religious experience at age 26. One night, I knelt beside my bed reading the Bible. I thumbed through the New Testament. Understanding poured into me. It was as if God pulled back a veil and allowed me to see the nature of things. The Holy Spirit showed me that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on a cross for our sins and rose from the dead. The room lit up in an unearthly white light. It was an experience similar to the one Paul had on the road to Damascus. Jesus did not speak to me but revealed the essence of the New Testament as ultimate truth. I will never forget it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A24D0DENA8N7GH	James Sadler	"From the time word first began to seep out that Mel Gibson was working on this film, controversy began to stir. Rumors had it that the film was anti-Semitic and unbelievably violent. And in what was viewed as sheer lunacy, he was filming it in the languages of the time: Latin and Aramaic. At first I thought Gibson had indeed lost his mind. It sounded as if he were making a pet project that would open and be either ignored or suffer the same fate as ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" a film continually excoriated despite its artistic merits.Yet in the past few months, as more details of the film crept out, I began to wonder if I might not be wrong. After seeing the film and witnessing the response to it, I have to say, I am now a Mel Gibson believer. He's not a madman; he's a genius! And not just for making such a compelling film. No, Gibson is also to be admired for the way he promoted this film and for putting his money where his mouth is as the $30 million film was paid for largely out of his own pocket.And financially the investment has paid off. Despite an ""R"" rating, the film took in $117 million over its opening 5 days, and shows no signs of slowing down. Gibson had difficulty finding a distributor, in fact I think a European company ultimately released it. None of the major studios would touch it, thinking they were brilliantly avoiding going down with a ship they thought was entirely driven by Gibson's ego. And, no doubt, many avoided it because of the religious issues. Before the film had even been screened it was already being attacked for anti-Semitism.Now the heads of those same studios are all probably kicking themselves for not taking it. After all, nothing speaks louder in Hollywood than money.As to the film itself, it's not flawless, but it is brilliantly conceived and executed. It is intense from the start as we witness Jesus struggling emotionally with his coming fate, hoping in some way to now have to face the next 12 hours of excruciating pain and torture. In contrast, it closes with a shot of Jesus resurrected and clearly at peace with himself and the world.What passes in the interim is largely faithful to the Bible, although Gibson did take some liberties. For example, there is no mention of Herod's wife in any of the Gospels, yet in the film she asks as her husband's conscience, asking him to not punish or crucify Jesus. Many have taken the film to task for its portrayal of Herod. Here he is presented as a man tortured by the whole event, seeking a way to avoid having to ultimately condemn Christ. I actually found this quite believable, despite historical reports of Herod's cruelty. And even the Gospels make some reference to Herod attempting to avoid the issue and finally washing his hands of it.The scenes of Judas being emotionally tortured by his betrayal of Christ were a little overboard. I do not think it was necessary to show him literally seeing demons to convey the guilt he must have felt.The flogging of Christ is unflinching and horrifying. If you are a Christian and have never thought of Christ as a physically strong individually, this extended sequence will leave you thinking otherwise. And it is followed by the long, tortured march to the hill where he will ultimately be crucified. Yes it is all bloody and awful, but it conveys all the emotion and pain of what was happening in ways that no previous film ever has. In most films about Christ, his crucifixion is almost portrayed as a relatively painless event, no to so here.You feel every nail being driven in to his flesh and can see the agony in his face and entire body throughout. James Caviezel will probably be ignored at Oscar time nest year, but he is deserving for so magnificently portraying every emotion that one subjected to such torture would have to feel.Most touching to me was the plight of Jesus' mother, Mary. I think how all this must have affected her is often glossed over. That maybe watching Jesus being tortured and ultimate killed was somehow tolerable because she knew he was the Messiah. Not so here and surely not so in reality. Mary is tormented and in pain throughout the ordeal, and the film does an excellent job of driving home the point that while he may have been the Son of God, he was also the son of a very real woman.The film has been criticized also for its very pro-Christian view, and clearly Christians are the intended audience. But it might have been worthwhile to have added a few more sequences that explained who and what Christ was. Gibson essentially drops into the end of a story without any real explanation of what has gone before. I know this was his intention, that he did not set out to tell the story of Christ's life, it just might have made it more palpable and understandable to non-Christians had there been a little more background. As a Christian I had no problem with understanding what had brought Jesus to the events depicted in the film, but I can see where a non-Christian might wonder, ""what is the point of all this?""The film is violent. But I find it odd that some of the same critics who admire such films as ""Platoon"" and ""Natural Born Killers, "" among many others, would criticize this film for its violence. If violence can ever truly lead to good, it certainly is the case with this film.Yes, it is violent, Yes, it is provocative. But, it is truly an excellent film, one that should not be missed. And I'm not kidding, if viewing this film doesn't evoke an emotional response from you, you must already be dead."	5.0	If This Film Doesn't Move You, You Don't Have a Pulse	2004-03-02	32	20	12

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ILWAZ6GIS6TT	James Witherspoon	I knew when I first saw previews for this movie and started hearing things about it, that I would not want to go see it, and if, for some reason, I did end up watching it, I would not like it. I was correct.First and foremost, this movie was incredibly boring. A good majority of the movie is spent watching Jesus get beat, hit, cut, or stabbed. I see no reason why anyone would enjoy watching this unless he is a sadist.The movie would get much lower than a five if it weren't for the scenes where it shows flashbacks that Jesus has with him spending time with his apostles. These scenes are uplifting, interesting, and sometimes humorous. The rest of the movie is just a bloody mess that seems to focus more on making you cringe than making you feel sympathetic.	2.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-08-04	45	7	38
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3BV0HJGBUIOI3	jamie	This movie was such a great movie. I know there is a lot of controversy about this film, but you can't expect someone to make a film about a bible story and not portray what the book says. It might make jews look bad but that was 1,000s of years ago and that's how it was back when. I loved the movie and this is coming from a christian who is not a normal church goer...in fact i haven't been to church in years and have kind of lost my faith, but when i saw the movie it totally changed my point of view and made me look at christ in a new way and start to become more of a believer. I def. recommend this movie to anyone...believer or non-believer. The movie was so touching that there were several times i wanted to cry but i held my tears back. basically....just see this movie!!!	5.0	This Movie Was Great!	2004-02-27	2	0	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3R8O489WZTYGF	Jamie X-Treme	'The Passion of the Christ' is an extremely graphic motion picture that depicts the gruesome torture & death of Jesus Christ. I'm not going to give a summary about this film because everyone should already know what it's about. This movie was very dramatic, very emotional, and extremely unsettling. The film contains the most graphic scourging scene in movie history!!! I wouldn't let your children watch this. Wait until they get a bit older. The acting is superb, the story, script, and characters are incredible. The soundtrack is depressingly atmospheric. Whether you're a believer or not, this movie is well worth a look. You'll walk away a changed person.	5.0	The Passion of the Christ ~ UNFORGETTABLE!!!!!	2004-02-28	5	4	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A39VCMXI2GKP98	Jan Chapman	If the point of this movie is to raise an awareness of what Christ suffered during the trial and crucifixion, it seems woefully inadequate to sit passively in a movie theater and watch the violence on the screen.  If people are determined to impress upon themselves the horrific suffering of the Passion, then perhaps they should allow themselves to be scourged and crucified.  Is this not the logical conclusion of such reasoning?Perhaps this sounds facetious, but I have a point.  We can never understand what Christ suffered.  Our inability to not comprehend the extent of Christ's suffering should not lead to a blase attitude about the crucifixion.  Neither should it lead to an unhealthy obsession with the pain and suffering on the cross, eclipsing the reason for the suffering, which was Christ's love for us.It seems to me that this movie errs on the side of the latter premise.  Gibson makes it clear that he wants to shock and horrify his audience out of their supposed complacency.  That supposition--that Christians are complacent in their attitude towards the cross--is insulting to all Christians who care very deeply about their faith.	1.0	Passive Witness	2004-04-10	43	9	34
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2H0XR7DQNN190	"J. Andreassen ""Cries of the Wilderness"""	"Now I am not here to start a debate, so I will just say a few things. Mel Gibson's film is mainly historically accurate with regards to the history given to us in the Gospels as well as non-biblical scholars, such as Josephus (his accords of the Jewish War have been proven to me really accurate (archaeological excavations) and the fact that he mentions the Crucification is very important), Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and the Talmud, among several others. The reality is that there is better historical documentation for Jesus than any other founder of any other ancient religions. Another interesting note, if one studies the discussions between the 1st century Jewish people and the Followers of the Jesus Movement (Jews and Gentiles alike), is that it was never denied that the tomb was indeed empty.As a Believer it's important that I do let my faith go blind, it's very important to me that what I believe is historical sound and a non-biased approach to Jesus of Nazareth will prove this. Like Lee Strobel, I started out a non-believer. The Passion came out around the time I started my research and it struck a cord in me, I could not at the time grasp what it meant for me, I do now though.My one observation is that Pontius Pilate was a much more sinister then he appears.This is one of those films that, if you are a seeker or non-believer, you must step outside of yourself and ask some questions, ""What is I was wrong? What if this man was truly the Son of Man?"" These are not easy questions, but they truly are the most important. I could go on and on, that's the temptation for me when I get going on this issue.So, thank you to Mel Gibson for portraying a positive view of Christianity. We were hungering for it. Other than the Passion of the Christ, the only other example of a positive image of Christianity that I can think of is Nightcrawler from X-Men 2. So thank you, I pray the generations will be watching."	5.0	The (Historical) Truth of the Passion	2004-08-14	11	8	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3Q04XXGGED746	"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker"""	This masterpiece has been criticized as being too violent. Actually, upon seeing it, I have to conclude that the actual problem is the fact that all previous films and plays about the Passion have been much too sanitized and nonviolent. Of course, the violence, apart from being historically accurate, is a reflection of the brutalities of the ancient world in general and the ancient Roman Empire in particular. Those liberals who complain about conservatives selectively condemning televised violence are just being silly. There is a world of difference between the careful depiction of violence in movies and the gratuitous violence that pervades modern movies and TV. Conservatives have never objected to the former, only the latter. Those who complain about the discrepancies in the Gospels are being equally silly. Apart from the fact that these discrepances are to be expected between independent eyewitness accounts, they are minor and easily reconciled with each other (much as variant newspaper accounts of the same event in no way negate the factuality of the event).The violence makes it easy to understand elements of the Passion. For instance, the abject brutality of the scourging makes it easy to understand why many of those flagellated died on the spot. It is amazing that our Lord did not die much sooner. Then again, God the Father needed His Son to live long enough to complete His atoning Sacrifice for our sake.Far from being anti-Semitic or otherwise portraying Jews in a unilaterally negative light, it includes portrayal of Jews as the victims of the Roman conquerors. This is shown by the derogatory remarks towards Jews by Pilate (e. g., This stinking province!...This rabble!...), as well as the Roman soldiers (e. g., An impossible people!...Help Him carry the cross--you Jew!).I disagree with those who say that the movie didn't pay attention to His teachings. Apart from the fact that the movie was about His Passion, and not primarily about His entire life and teachings, it does include substantial references to the latter. These include flashbacks to the time of Jesus as a Boy, Jesus following the trade of His father Joseph as a carpenter, the forgiveness of the adulteress, the command to love one's enemies, the command to love one another as He had loved them, Peter's promise never to betray Him, etc.Because He died to take away my sins, the film enabled me to see myself as His tormentor. It was I who was spitting on Him, scourging Him so savagely, making Him carry the Cross, and then nailing Him to it.The film concludes with a good visual portrayal of His Resurrection. The grave clothes stay wrapped together while His resurrected Body passes right through them, and His Body still contains the nail marks of His Passion. A superb film! The only question is why a film of this quality had not been produced much sooner.	5.0	Captures the Essence of Christ's Passion	2007-08-20	14	10	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A38OH4E75BRI2J	Janus	"The Passion of the ChristI went to see Mel Gibson's, ""The Passion of the Christ,"" on 3/1/04 and I'm glad that I did.  I almost decided against going after listening to all the criticism in the local Boston media.  I found the movie to be bloody but powerful.  As the local pundits had predicted, I became numb to the brutality early on in the film but I did not become numb to the meaning or the message. I think that you have to go to this movie with the idea that you are meditating on the crucifixion.  You are not going to be entertained or informed.Despite what you may have heard, there is more to this movie than blood and gore.  In flashbacks we see a very engaging young man who loves life.  We are given glimpses of the loving relationship between Jesus and his mother and can see in the way that Jesus deals with people, why he attracted so many to his teachings.I did not see anti-Semitism in this movie.  It was made very clear that Jesus chose this for Himself and that He was in control of his destiny.  Evil was the villain and in this movie evil was portrayed in the form of a devil-like creature that lurked about whenever good was about to prevail.  When Jesus died and then rose to life, it is fitting that we see evil's agony in hell.  You really have to see the movie to understand.  The photography was beautiful and so was the music.  However, this movie is not for everyone.  It is harsh!My hope is that this movie will do well and that Mel Gibson will be inspired to put as much time, energy and passion into a sequel that will tell the story of what happened next and how those who knew Jesus were inspired to go out and change the world."	5.0	We Can Change the World	2004-03-06	2	2	0

As any who have caught wind of the film well know, it is visually, the most graphic depiction of Christ's final hours ever conceived. Unlike many others though, I feel as though the its graphic nature only acts as a catalyst to enhance the viwer's grasp of the magnitude of the sacrifice Christ made to absolve us of our sins. Granted, it may be too violnet for others, especially those who are used to the archetypical, bloodless version of Christ's crucifixion, which we've become so accustomed to from movies past. My best advice to those who are debating on whether or not they're willing to see it, is that Christian or not, everyone can benefit positively from what this film has to say.	5.0	An emotionally  gripping depiction of Christ's final hours	2004-06-16	9	8	1

OK we all know the story and know that it was terrible but come on make a film of more than two hours only to show that?!?!?!?!. I really feel that the only reason why this movie was made it's because it's a story that everyone knows and of corse it's very good and interesting.I'm sorry, lots of people must think that this is an excellent movie but I totally find it disgusting, there's no respect to the religion and the producers simply wanted to make money with a ""masterpiece"".I know that money makes the world spin and with this I'm not saying that I don't like money.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A11RCGZGVXFPPV	"Jayelle Kay ""foofoowoman"""	This film moved me very deeply in spite of all the buzz about the violence it depicts. First of all, the violence in this film didn't come as a surprise to me as what He went through in His final hours has been preached to me since I was young. Most present day churches tend to shy away from these facts. Secondly, it isn't anti-Semitic as Jesus came here to die. That was stated as much in the film. Why the Jews happened to be the vehicle I may not fully understand, it was their time and their land geographically speaking. But Christ came here with the SPECIFIC purpose to die for our sins,,,A SACRIFICE. Which brings me to the last part. Yes, His resurrection is what differentiates Him from other notable holy figures, He came back from the dead and is alive today awaiting the time when He'll make His second appearance on this earth. But it was the blood He shed as payment for our sins that is central to our salvation. It was the practice then to have a blood sacrifice to atone for sins but when we, as humans, just couldn't get it right Jesus came here to shed His blood to pay that price once and for all. That is what this film depicts.  The cleansing power of the blood. Churches nowadays are totally bloodless in their sermons. They've sanitized religion and put a happy face on it. Heaven forfend that anyone should feel bad about themselves or what they do. Mr. Gibson's film brings us right back where we belong; at the foot of the cross washed by His blood.	5.0	Give me that old time religion	2004-04-10	6	4	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ZGB8VP73DWJW	Jay	"I sat down to write this review almost a week ago just hours after I'd seen this film, but it's effect on me was such that I decided to wait a while so that I could try to gain a more objective perspective on this work, but I still haven't achieved that distance and realistically I don't think I ever will.  Mel Gibson may have walked his own Via Dolorosa to make this film but the result is not only worth it, it's astonishing!This depiction of the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is perhaps one of the most extreme pieces mainstream cinema ever offered to a public audience, though ironically perhaps, this film would probably have caused much less of a stir among our great-grandparents generation than it has among us.  There is no compromise here, from the first scene as we descend from the clouds into the garden of Gethsemane the viewer becomes a silent observer at the pivot joint of history and is spared absolutely nothing.  This is not a film you watch as much as witness.Much has been made of the level of violence in this film, with one critic going as far as to call it a ""Theatre of sadomasochism"" and another calling it ""The Gospel according to the Marquis De Sade"", but modern cinema contains an absurd level of violence, the body count in the average Schwarzenegger movie makes ""The Passion of the Christ"" look almost mild by comparison.  But what we are accustomed to seeing is violence that has been sanitised for our consumption (or is it delectation?); the truly horrific effect of a bullet or a knife on the human body has been turned into light entertainment or titillation.  I can't help but feel concerned that respected critics feel that it's permissible to feed the public a constant diet of gratuitous violence in what amounts to a moral and ethical vacuum, with no effort being made to show its real effect on the victim, the victim's loved ones and even the perpetrator.Likewise charges of anti-Semitism have been made against this film.  Well what can I say about that?  What once person finds deeply offensive another person may not have a problem with, offense like taste is a most subjective matter and I can only give my opinion.  In my opinion, many of the individual Jews portrayed here such as Simon, Veronica and Mary Magdalene serve to give the film its humanity.  The mob portrayed while on the surface Jewish, seemed to me on a deeper level to represent a cross section of all humanity rather than focusing on any one particular ethnic group, serving at least in part as a warning of the ability of the mob to override the individual's sense of justice and morality.  The overwhelming message being that Jesus willingly gave himself up for the sins of the whole world, which is explicitly stated at the beginning of the film and while a mind already poisoned by hatred and bigotry may take a different meaning, in my opinion I don't feel that ""The Passion of the Christ"" is either deliberately or accidentally anti-Semitic.But whatever one may feel about this film, what nobody can deny is that Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the delicate use of colour and texture serve to make this film a deeply tactile experience.  The acting performances are universally masterful; the score provides the backdrop to the images while never drawing undue attention to itself and Mel Gibson's direction shows all the depth and subtly of the greatest directors.  But really all this is academic; the ultimate test of this film is the reaction of the viewer.  I was deeply moved by ""The Passion of the Christ"" and for me personally the most affecting parts were the almost peripheral events such as the denial of Peter, the total despair of Judas, the torment of Pilate, the compassion of Veronica and Simon and in the end if a work of art moves the viewer on a deep and personal level, what more can it possibly hope to achieve?"	5.0	A film to stand with the greats	2004-04-01	2	0	2

Whether you believe that Christ is the Savior of man, this movie can be appreciated for its bravery.  I kept thinking ""when will this end,"" even though I knew exactly when.  The sobs were caught so deeply in my throat that I could hardly breath.  That any man, and regardless of belief, he was a man as well as God so his doubts and constant fight for faith that what was happening to him was for the greater good is to be understood.  The pain that was endured so that ALL could know the Lord even though we are completely unworthy is astounding.  I knew what would happen and I thought that I was prepared.  I was wrong.  Even my wildest imagination could not have conceived the agony of these final hours.  I have read many reviews on this movie that are fighting about the nature of His love rather than the Nature of His death.  But really, don't they go hand in hand?  Who but someone who loves with every fiber of His soul could endure this kind of torture for the salvation of those that he loved?  Would I lay down my life for my children?  In a heartbeat.  Would I endure unimaginable torture to spare them from the very same?  Without doubt!  Would the pain cause me to waiver?  Quite possibly.  Would I continue anyway?  Beyond question.

Jesus' resistance to the temptation to pick up the sword, and His decision to pick up His cross and endure all suffering until He fulfilled His Messianic mission on Golgotha was deeply moving and inspiring. However, this film reinforces the distortion that most Jews hated Jesus and wanted Him crucified. Thus our people were falsely labeled as &quot;Christ-killers.&quot; In reality, Jesus was very popular with most of the Jewish people of His day. It was this popularity that caused the political and religious leaders to fear and envy Him. He was secretly arrested and tried, not to hide it from the Roman authorities -- who also feared Him -- but from His fellow Jews. Likewise today, most Jews regard Jesus highly, as a good and wise man, perhaps even a prophet.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2FA1MQ6AAVJBV	"J. Bisset ""jbisset"""	The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful and effective movies I've ever seen. Mel Gibson has set out to create a movie that does one thing: to lead the viewer to a place where you actually feel and experience the enormity of the sacrifice that Christ made...and he does it superbly in this movie. This is not a documentary of the life of Christ (although its substance is taken directly from the Biblical accounts). It is not a political statement about who killed Christ or why. It is a focused look at the central theme of Christianity: Christ's sacrifice.As far as the violence, it is clearly done to push the viewer to feel the utter depths of Christ's suffering. However, it is not violence for violence sake (like most Hollywood movies). While it is quite disturbing, it does have a clear purpose and that is to show the viewer the true love Christ had for the world (otherwise, why would he go through all that?). And by the way, since when did movie critics start having a problem with violence in the movies? (I recall many critics praising such movies as Hannibul, Gladiator, Natural Born Killers and Seven to name a few).Finally, the anti-semitism charge. This one I simply don't get. There are many Jews in the movie who are compassionate towards Christ (who is also a Jew of course). The only real Jews who have animosity towards Christ are the Sanhedren (sp?). They are a group of religious and political elites who were threatened by Jesus. Yes they were Jews but their hatred was more political than anything. There were even some of the Sanhedren who were shown being strongly against the crucifiction of Jesus. But the real issue of Christ's death which is VERY clear in the movie is this: Jesus was not a victim. No one took His life from Him. Not Jews. Not Romans. He gave it willingly and purposefully.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A39NGYK97FBZM3	"J. B Kraft ""lonestargazer"""	"First, a little perspective about the reviewer. I am not Catholic or Jewish, but a Christian and member of a mainstream denomination with an undergraduate degree in history and a professional postgraduate degree.STYLE: I did not see this movie in a cinema, because I live in a small town without a decent cinema, and because I felt this subject made this film better suited to private viewing. Mel Gibson chose good actors and the film was well-filmed. However, its generally Italian cast reminded me in some ways of the Italian biblical pictures of the late 50s and 60s. I found Mel Gibson's use of the vernacular languages of the time very distracting, and an interferance to understanding a basic story that I was familiar with from my childhood. The language was such a problem that my wife and I changed to ""English narration for the visually impaired"", which was a woman reading the dialog in English and describing the scenes. It helped a lot. The major roles were excellent -- Jesus, Mary Magdalene, but I felt the language kept me from really understanding or identifying with them. Pilate, on the other hand, appeared to be channeling Brando in The Godfather. There was not a real attempt at providing any context for people unfamiliar with the story, which was a great lapse, and there were some significant problems. How much violence was there? It was so over the top, that it made Scarface look like Bambi. There was so much blood, and so much torture that it was impossible to believe that anyone could have lived through it to get to the cross. The film was somewhat dark, cramped, and confusing, so it was at first difficult to be sure who anyone was. Finally, there was an enigmatic resurrection scene totally devoid of emotional resonance and seemingly gratuitously grafted onto the first ending. Color and sound quality of the DVD were excellent.SUBSTANCE -- I understand why some people criticized parts of this movie as anti-Semitic, and I understand why some people said it was ""too Catholic"". The character Satan is so enigmatic I will leave him to someone else to explain his part, and there are CGI transformations of children into demons tormenting Judas. I will have to say that Mel Gibson imagined/created one of the most wondrous scenes I have ever seen, that for me summarized the whole dramatic impact of the subject. At the end of the crucifiction, after Jesus surrenders his spirit and dies, an overhead shot pans back and back, receding obviously into the sky. At the sky level, the scene undergoes a CGI transform into a drop of clear liquid, a tear from God, which when it hits the ground triggers the earthquake. As awesome as this was, the resurrection (final scene) was a brief, minimalist anti-climax that was incredibly disappointing to me, and clearly an afterthought. The burial linens suddenly deflate, and an enigmatic (and tastefully nude) Jesus walks out into the light of day."	4.0	Not for the faint of heart or stomach	2004-10-04	7	4	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A32Z1TDULHZNVK	J. Bodal	It would be impossible for someone to go through what the character named Jesus went through in that movie.  In order for someone to die then be ressurected a few days later they would have to be a god or something, and we all know gods do not exist.The illogical fallacies in this movie are far surpassed by the utter boredom that I received from watching some dude get whipped, beaten and tortured for a good 3 hours.  The movie did not explain anything, or even tell a story for that matter.  The Passion of Christ was basically an extremely long sentence fragment that tried to explain the hardships that the fictional character Jesus went through because he opposed the government by pretending to be a magical god.Scientific evidence proves that humans cannot do many of the things that Jesus did, unless of course they use magic.  And not this higher-power all-mighty magic, but a more realistic Lance Burton magic that involves slight of hand and exploiting a people's weakness for needing a reason for why everything exists.  I gave this movie 1 star because it claims to be a non-fictional account of the life of Jesus when it is obviously not.  It was a horribly told story that involved a lot of unnecessary violence.	1.0	Would have been better if it was actually true	2005-01-25	77	18	59
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A4MFSI018OUQK	"J. Border ""John B"""	"As a Catholic, I had high hopes for this movie. Before its release, the press notices had mentioned that The Passion would relive Christ's final hours with painstaking realism, unlike the ""sanitized"" movies that had gone before it. The quest for historical accuracy would go to such lengths as to have a fully Aramaic and Latin script (with subtitles)! With such uncompromised attention to detail, it seemed as if The Passion had the potential to become the greatest among the movies about Christ. However, when I saw this film in the theatre shortly after its release, it quickly became apparent that the film was the product of a disturbed and rather shallow mind. In the hands of a talented, intelligent director/producer, this could have been a masterpiace; in the hands of Mel Gibson, it has the same level of artistic subtlety as a cheesy Hollywood action movie. For the sake of brevity, I will list a few reasons why this movie fails:* The portrayal of Jesus is wooden in the extreme, and He is portrayed as little more than a dull, lifeless punching bag. His luminous, devine nature ought to shine through His suffering and sacrifice. Based on this movie's portrayal of Jesus, few non-Christians who watch this film would understand why Christians believe in Him.* The film relies on the unconvincing and cheesy use of computer graphics during several key parts of the movie: for example, the bridge scene (from which Jesus is thrown), the Satanic apparitions, and the Crucifixion (the raven and the earthquake sequences come to mind).* The film promotes Jew hatred. For example, the movie portrays all of the Pharisees as bloodthirsty, violent, and treacherous without exception, even though there is historical evidence that some of the Pharisees sympathized with Jesus. More outrageously, the film inserts a completely ahistorical sub-plot about Pilate and his wife, and how they sympathize with Jesus. Lastly, The Passion fails to portray the Jewish background of Jesus and his disciples.In summary, this is a film that might satisfy so-called Christians who also happen to have really bad taste. If you like Die Hard-type action movies, this might be a great movie for you. But those who seek an intelligent, artistically and spiritually satisfying film about Christ will need to look elsewhere. Among the movies about Christ, Bertolucci's TV miniseries ""Jesus of Nazareth"" remains the best, with an outstanding performance by Robert Powell. Among the broader genre of Christian movies, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" remains the greatest movie ever made, bar none. Every Christian should see this astonishing, harrowing portrayal of courage and sacrifice."	2.0	Clumsy, overwrought, unintelligent portrayal of the Passion	2009-08-30	12	4	8

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2BVS1YKHIVHH0	J. Bryant	"It's no accident that ""The Passion"" was brought to the world in the year 2004.  Whether you might believe it or not, we are very, very near to the day when Jesus' long-expected Second Coming will occur.  The signs of His coming are everywhere.  And as the world grows ever-darker with violence and evil of every sort, God has used an entertainment medium--the motion picture--to reach a huge number of His children with a staggering reminder of His love, forgiveness and the promise of our eternal destiny.Mel Gibson was God's perfect choice to make ""The Passion"" and to do it right.  When ""Christian"" production companies have attempted to tell the story of Christ's suffering and death, the results have come off looking cheap and amateurish.  Hollywood hasn't done much better; its versions have nearly always been overly-pious, sanitized and outrageously cliched.  But as a self-admitted sinner-saved-by-grace, Gibson possessed both the humility to invite divine inspiration and the God-given artistic vision to be able to make the story truly come alive again.  As he stated, ""The Holy Spirit was running the show--I was just directing traffic.""What makes ""The Passion"" so very powerful is its gritty honesty.  For the first time we get a ""reality check"" of the heartbreaking consequences of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice--a sorrow made even worse by the fact that, as horrific as the images in this film are, they probably pale by comparison to what Jesus REALLY experienced during that final day of His earthy life.  Much of this film is extremely difficult to watch, and yet it brings us to a profoundly deeper appreciation for the unfathomable love shown by God on our behalf.The theatrical release of ""The Passion"" was seen by many millions of people around the world.  Now that it can be viewed in the privacy of one's home, the film's audience will increase even more dramatically--as is surely God's intention.  In the year 2004, ""The Passion"" is one of God's few remaining calls to His wayward children--a call to ""come home"" to the shelter of His unending love and the eternal truth of His Living Word."	5.0	"""The Passion"" is The Greatest Love Story of All Time"	2004-09-02	11	5	6

If I could have heard it in English it would have been able to feel it more.  The tenderness, anger was lost for me.  Hearing Jesus voice so that I could understand the hurt, anger and sadness in it would havekept my attention.  The blood looked like Kechup, it was a turn off.  When Veronica whiped his face when he fell itlooked like she was trying not to rub off his makeup.  The cut of his sidepored blood out like a fountain.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2R0XJ6X869AE0	J. D. Stiles	"""The Passion of the Christ"" is unlike any other film most of us have seen. I think that's something on which we can agree.The message Mel Gibson intends to convey here is summed up by the first image the viewer sees (after the production company logo): The text of Isaiah 53:5 - which, in the New International Version, says: ""He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. (NIV)""If you will not, under any circumstances, allow yourself or your family to see graphic violence, take the Isaiah verse as Gibson's ""don't say I didn't warn you"" message. The Bible tells us Jesus suffered much on what we now call Good Friday, and if Gibson is to illustrate the wounds by which ""we are healed,"" dear movie viewer, things are going to get ugly. By making this movie, I think Gibson wanted to show the audience that he clearly believes his sin (and yours, mine and that of every mortal man and woman who ever lived) caused Jesus, who was without sin, to endure mocking, scorn, a long, brutal whipping, followed by more mocking and scorn, followed by another beating, followed by a long walk up Golgotha with the heavy wooden cross to which his stretched-out limbs were nailed - the cross on which He endured still more mocking and scorn, and eventually died. I think Gibson succeeds in illustrating the sacrifice Jesus made, and in illustrating the depths of brutality he believes a person is capable of inflicting - literally as well as figuratively - out of selfish pride. I think that's all he really intended to portray.The violence shown in the movie is graphic, but the press had carried so many stories that discussed the violent scenes that I failed to be shocked once I actually saw the movie.I think ""The Passion of the Christ"" is an important movie because it got a lot of people talking about Jesus outside of church, but if you're looking for something that offers comprehensive coverage of Jesus' life and teachings, you won't find that here. I also caution against substituting this, or any movie, for scripture if you're looking for a way to share the Gospel - as some people seem to have done (I could elaborate on this, but the review is already getting a bit long). But if you're looking for a powerful story and a well-made movie, you will find that in ""The Passion of the Christ.""Mel Gibson's decision to use Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin rather than English was a great one. The multi-lingual scripting more effectively shows the cultural divisions that existed between the Romans and Judeans. We've already seen Jesus movies where everyone speaks English. It's about time for something different. The actors do a good job of putting feeling into their lines even though they aren't speaking their native languages.Also on the movie's choice of languages - a response to another review. The statement about the language of Jesus' day being Greek, not Aramaic or Hebrew, is incorrect. The original New Testament language was Greek, but the NT was written down years after Christ's life on Earth. Just because the Bible is written in Greek or Hebrew doesn't mean those are the only languages the people spoke in those days in those places. Re-read your Bible intro, do a little more research on the Bible and Middle Eastern history, or find someone who has done the research before presenting your biases as ""facts."" Mel Gibson did his homework on the languages (so did the actors). Other aspects of the movie that are being debated (appearance of the devil, the demon kids haunting Judas,etc.) are a matter of theological viewpoint and artistic license (things we haven't seen, such as demons that must have haunted Judas during and after the betrayal, have to be expressed visually because this is a movie!) Please remember that ""The Passion of the Christ"" was not meant to be a documentary, nor was it meant to be ""The Bible on Film.""I only give 3 stars here because I haven't wanted to buy this DVD and watch this movie for a third, fourth or fifth time while sitting in my jammies munching on popcorn and pizza. It's a good movie, but it's not that kind of movie."	3.0	This review is actually about the movie!	2005-04-03	8	5	3

I am going to give it 4 stars for the attempt to stick with historical accounts. It loses one star for giving in to changes in the story/script a tiny bit to political correctness (you know, the ""open minded people""). Is not easy to watch but as said it is dealing with a viloent time. Many will watch this with the attitude that Gibson was cashing in on this story. I would remind before watching to keep in mind that Gibson was turned down by all studios for this project but because he believed in the story being put to film he was willing to do it himself, to risk most all he had in this world to seeing it be made. Many will dislike this movie for that reason only. There is no greater divider than Christ. Those that Love Him will want to see this movie in hopes of knowing Him better.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" spurred intense interest in America in the spring of 2004. The DVD version can only continue the phenomenon.Based on the visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich, a German nun of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, ""The Passion"" fills in the wide narrative gaps in the gospel accounts of Christ's Passion. Emmerich's visions are believed by the very pious to depict, in excruciating and accurate detail, the agonies of Jesus Christ in his last hours. Gibson has stretched and cut Emmerich's visions -- adding an extreme amount of blood, gore and screaming -- to achieve his final effect. Like it or not, this very affecting movie will either awe you (seemingly the majority of viewers) or dismay and upset you (the minority, including this reviewer).The buzz is that this the most authentic depiction of Christ's Passion ever filmed. Actors speak in Latin and Aramaic -- in Gibson's mind, the languages of the time. Neither does Gibson spare the gory details. Roman scourging is said to have been brutal; Gibson shows us each blood-spattering, flesh-rending blow in agonizing detail. The results are visually arresting, serving up searing mental images that will stay with viewers for a lifetime. (PLEASE do not bring kids under 14 to this movie!) Religious authorities have lauded the film. Entire theaters were reserved for church groups. The Holy Father is said to have uttered (falsely, as it turns out) ""It is as it was.""So what's the problem? ""The Passion"" is a movie curiously dislocated in time. It bears more resemblance to 19th century Roman Catholic peasant piety than to that of secular 21st century Protestant America. As a middle-aged Roman Catholic, I recall how nuns exaggerated and fetishized the details of Christ's Passion. Gibson does the same, lovingly embracing the wood of the Cross; caressing the nails; cherishing the scourges; singing praises to the crown of thorns. I am also boggled by the film's historical inaccuracies. Greek, not Latin, was the *lingua franca* of the Mediterranean world. Having Christ chat with Pilate in Latin was silly. The inscription on the Cross is rendered in Latin and Aramaic only, omitting Greek, against the evidence of the gospels. And if scourging was the standard means for weakening execution victims, why was only Jesus scourged? Dramatically, the movie is propelled only by its unrelenting violence. The acting is perfunctory, the costuming bizarre, the make-up unconvincing and the actors' delivery plodding -- as if...as if... they were carefully pronouncing syllables from dead languages.Gibson's theological statements about the redemptive value of Jesus's death are questionable. Did the Father required an extraordinarily brutal death to atone for a brutal humanity? Or did redemption require the living of an obedient life, as noted throughout the New Testament? Gibson's choice tells us more about him than about God.""The Passion of Christ"" doesn't add much to the current filmography about the life of Christ. What it does add is highly dubious and often plain wrong. Used cautiously as a devotional aid, ""The Passion"" might help believers to visualize the agony that Christ underwent on our behalf. If asked, though, I'd steer people to the gospels instead"	2.0	A Bloody Mess	2004-09-30	29	18	11

I never got to see it in theatres- it never came to this country.  Perhaps that had an impact- not seeing it on the big screen.  But I just couldn't empath with what I saw.  To me, it was an interesting portrayal of the death of Jesus by an actor.  I think in large part this was due to the lack of the life of Jesus.  There were only a few flashbacks to alleviate what we saw on the screen- there was little of his life and who he was.  We couldn't see him as a human really- although we certainly saw him as a human in suffering.  In order to relate to a character, we also need to see him or her as a human in times of joy.  Instead, it was near unmitigated bloodshed and carnage.I was impressed by the suffering Jesus had to go through.  It was horrible.  But I was moved to tears only once- when Pilate's wife gave burial cloth to Mary.  This was a human moment; I saw people interacting with each other.  This was missing from the life of Jesus.  Or rather, the life of Jesus was missing.  It was one long death.I wanted more at the end too.  It was definitely a Catholic portrayal, with the focus on the death of Christ rather than the resurrection.  (Of course, Protestants tend to err too much in the other direction.)  The end was too short, too quick- I don't get to see the wonder of resurrection.  But at least there was some resurrection at the end.Also Catholic was the focus on Mary.  This helped bring a more human element into the picture, but it was odd how Mary repeatedly became the inspiration for Jesus in His suffering, rather than God being that inspiration.  There's not even a hint of that in the text.  Also very weird were the bits of demonic elements, looking something like baboons.  And seeing a near-naked Jesus at the end is...unsettling.While there have been many claims of anti-Semitism in this movie, I saw no evidence of this.  It appeared to be what it was- a bunch of Jews and Romans killing a Jew, who had Jewish family and friends.  In fact, it presented far fewer positive portrayals of Romans/Gentiles than do the Gospels.  It is unfortunate that the line ""His blood be upon us and all our children!"" was stricken out of the subtitles, though kept in the Aramaic- it is a moving line, true to the original text and history.  Lest the Gospels are now themselves anti-Semitic...It was enjoyable to hear the original speech.  Though we are still not sure if Jesus spoke Greek or Aramaic on a regular basis, it felt like I was getting closer to the feel of what the Lord actually said.  And, knowing some Arabic, it was fun to catch the occasional word and phrase that I recognized.I do recommend this movie.  It gives a moving portrayal, a different perspective, and a helpful understanding of the actual times and death of Jesus.  It just wasn't what I had hoped for and expected, without the life of Jesus."	3.0	Death without Life	2004-10-26	18	13	5

I'm not a religious person therefore my comments are solely based on the film as a film. Apparently the director was expecting the audience to have pre-knowledge of this story. I didn't. The film never helped me to understand why people believed this man to be the son of god. I never understood why he was eventually crucified other than the fact that he defied the laws of that time by declaring he was the son of god. I feel the director could not see the forest for the trees. Apparently he was too far into his understanding of religion to provide a narrative that was sufficient enough to enable the less versed to follow the story. I have seen other religious films that have better conveyed this story (King of Kings for example). I am amazed that people actually paid to see this trash.

Messenger	"Mel Gibson's film is as beautiful and startling as a Caravagio painting... and mind you, it's hard to call a film full of grotesque violence as ""beautiful.""It's Passion depiction is cruel and frightening... as it SHOULD be. No more comfortable crucifixion movie scenes... thank God.The flogging depicted was probably worse than what really happened. As a Shroud of Turin believer, I believe that Jesus was horribly flogged by a flagrum that featured dumb-bell shaped pellets of wood or bone... not a flagrum with sharp metal blades. Christ's entire body was blistered and bleeding, but probably not shredded as it was in this film. It would be hard to believe that anyone would be able to bear a cross... or even WALK... after what this film shows as the scourging.As an artistic depiction, however, the overdone scourging depicts how it must had felt for our savior... the agony.As for whether the film is anti-semitic or not, simply read the account written by the Roman- Jewish historian, Josephus. Josephus writes of a Jewish prophet that came after Christ, who preached the downfall of the Temple. The SANHEDRIN arrested him, and turned him over to the Roman Governor. He was scourged by the Roman Governor and set free... and the angry Sanhedrin wasn't very pleased. A stealth assassin ended up killing this prophet of doom with a stone.Thus, Josephus confirms that the Jewish government of that generation  would turn a fellow Jew over to the gentiles, if such a brethern dared to oppose them in any way.As the final closer to this controversy, Jesus said that ""no man"" could take his life... only he could lie it down for us. Thus, the ""Jews"" didn't kill Jesus... the ""Romans"" didn't kill Jesus... JESUS willingly died for our sake.Mel humanizes the Lord in a special way... and the scenes between Christ and his mother are especially stirring.

Hauck ""Guerrilla Reader"""	"Without getting into the historical and philosophical differences between the monotheistic religions and their denominations, understand that you will get out of this movie only what you put into it.  In other words, if you consider yourself a Christian, you will most likely fit into the type of audience the movie was made for and targeted at.  If you are not a Christian you will have the advantage to see the movie through a more critical lens as you will refuse to ""suspend your disbelief.""When I first saw this movie in the theater, there was not one person in any of the rows of stadium seating around me who was not sobbing with grief.  I have never before experienced such a powerful outpouring of emotion from nearly every patron; male, female, and every race and ethnicity.  It was simply unbelievable.The movie is long and I actually contemplated getting up and leaving the theater because of the unrelenting nature of the flagellation and abuse that Christ had to endure.  It is that very facet, however, that pulls at the heartstrings of humanity and creates the collective sympathetic atmosphere so that the people viewing can weep and moan unabashedly together without embarassment as each one identifies with the Christ.  The DVD is good.  Allow yourself the luxury of watching the movie without distraction and see for yourself.  I rate this movie at five stars.  I personally have never seen a movie with the power to force such personal introspection as this one does.  Love it or hate it, this movie has got to be regarded as one of the cinematic classics!."	5.0	An Emotional Ride Of A Movie!	2004-10-27	20	14	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	In this amazing and moving story, Academy Award winner Mel Gibson describes the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus Christ, from the Last Supper to the Crucifixion.  Jesus was betrayed by Judas and handed over to his enemies, who condemn him and sentence him to die.  He is brought before Pontus Pilate, who has Jesus bound and flogged.  The flogging scenes are some of the most graphic of the movie.  Finally, Pontus Pilate agrees to turn Jesus over for Crucifixion.The Crucifixion is one of the most moving and powerful segments of the movie.  Seeing Jesus crying and asking God to forgive his captors literally brought tears to my eyes.  Jesus also promised salvation to one of the thieves, also crucified, who repented of his sins.  Jesus' death was marked by a darkening of the world, and when one of the soldiers was told to pierce Jesus' side to make sure he was dead, blood and water poured from the wound.  Jesus was finally taken down from the cross on Good Friday and laid to rest in the tomb, but he was resurrected three days later on Easter Sunday.This is one of the most powerful and awe-inspiring films I've ever seen.  Director Mel Gibson does a remarkable job describing the last hours of Jesus' life and the scenes, especially the flogging, cross-bearing, and Crucifixion, are some that I'll never forget.  I highly recommend this powerful and moving film.  Watch and see how our Savior suffered and died for our sins and won the ultimate victory with his resurrection.	5.0	Mel Gibson's Epic Story About Jesus	2004-09-09	11	8	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3BO684PNY4IS9	JEF	While no-one should call this DVD, or the movie in general, pleasant, it is the only movie that I can think of that *should* aim for an R rating.  The Passion of the Christ is not fun to watch, but it brought home to me in a whole new way how very badly Christ was treated for our sakes.As a Catholic, this seemed to me to be a very Catholic protrayal.  If you are not Catholic, however, this should not put you off.  Whether Moslem, Protestant, Catholic, atheist, or agnostic, everyone should see this film.  I say this not because I believe it will convert you, but because it is a stunning portrayal of ultimate love.  It is clear in the faces of both Jesus and Mary that this film, however brutal, is truly about love.In sum, this is my advice:  Buy the DVD.  Watch it once.  Put it away for a while, then watch it again.  Don't watch it too often, but watch it.  I truly believe that you will know what I mean here once you have watched it just once.	5.0	A Powerful Portrayal	2005-02-12	11	6	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A83TWQ1J9YU0A	J. Ellis	"I prefered the Monty Python movie - The Life of Brian on the same subject. For all the pre release publicity about The Passion being an anti Jewish movie, I didn't think Gibson portrayed the Jewish,/Roman class of cilizations very well.In Gibson's film, the Romans with the exception of Pilate and his wife come off as sadists. In real history, the Romans were bringing civilization, the rule of law, civic order to backward, chaotic region of the world and the Jewish people were just another group of people resisting the progress of Roman civilization. This theme was presented very well in the Python movie The Life of Brian.The Romans considered Jesus of Nazareth to be a very decent, honest Jewish religious teacher, one of the few honest people in this backward, insignificant part of the Roman Empire.Was Jesus the real Jewish Messiah? In real history, the Roman's didn't really care too much, it wasn't something that should shake the entire Roman empire - which it eventually did do.Back to Gibson's movie. I found it to be almost 2 hours of non stop torture,  what's the point?The one very good part was Gibson's depiction of Satan as this transexual creature always ""lurking"" in the crowd, lurking in the mob. That was a nice touch."	3.0	Prefered the Life of Brian	2004-06-05	25	8	17
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	In a powerful rapture of graphic storytelling, Mel Gibson's vision of Christ's last hours on earth is shocking, disturbing and strangely uplifting in some ways.  Shot in remote locations that are very similar to the harsh countryside of the supposed location of the crucifixion, the movie looks authentic with just a bit of Hollywood drama.The Passion is a tough movie to watch.  It pains you with brutal scenes of torture inflicted on Christ as he is persecuted for his claims of being the King of the Jews and the Son of God.  The anti-Semitic allegations really aren't warranted.  I mean, c'mon, if he hadn't been accused of being a Blasphemer, then he would not have sacrificed himself.  The high priests feared the coming of Jesus because it meant that he could tell the people the truth, truth that they didn't want people to know.  They didn't want a mad man to fill the people's heads with fantasy, nor did they want to true son of God to make them realize what was really happening.  In short, they would lose their place and stature as religious leaders.  THAT is simply human nature.  If Christ showed up today I have no doubt many Christians would doubt his authenticity.  I don't think God faults us for our weaknesses and fears, so I don't believe in the end the religious leaders would suffer divine persecution.Back to the movie though, it is not just a religious revival of the death of Jesus.  It is a story, one that many people already know so a lot of structural detail is left out.  Mel Gibson instead focuses on interesting aspects, mostly in flashbacks, that you may not expect, particularly the mother and son relationship between Jesus and Mary.  With such heavy influence on Mary and her struggle with watching her son's death, this is definitely a Catholic's perspective (Gibson is a devout Catholic).  But there is nothing wrong with this, it adds a very emotional impact.  The lack of focus on Mary Magdelan is strange though.  The one scene that flashes back to her stoning and Christ rescuing her from that torture is short and actually puts Christ in a heroic light.  Once again, nothing wrong with this.  It gives him a strong presence as if to say `anything that happens to him happens because he wishes it to happen'.  One very good dramatic element is the struggle of Pontius Pilate to not have Christ killed.  It is one of the best character conflictions of the story.  Pilate tries very hard to keep this man, who may simply be delusional, from being convicted by a very angry crowd.  He doesn't want an uprising, but he doesn't want to kill someone out of the crowd's sheer hate.  His final decision to release an insane and homicidal criminal is a last ditch effort to avoid the inevitable.  Other than displaying beyond human endurance, there isn't much in the way of performance that Jim Caviezel can do.  But he still plays the part well where he can.  There is an especially good scene with his mother where he is displaying his skills as a carpenter, showing us how he must have spent most of his life making a living.  The opening scene in the garden has him begging his father to not have to go through with the sacrifice, a very human reaction.  Lucifer stands close by trying to convince him that one man cannot save the entire human race.  The action of killing the snake released by Lucifer is extremely symbolic and again puts Christ in a heroes light.The production value of this movie is very good.  The cinematography is stark and realistic, but again a bit Hollywood.  Being forced to read the translations can be tiring, I think some line did not have to be translated and the point could have been understood.  Kudos should be given all around to the actors for learning what they had to of the dead Aramaic language.  The CGI effects are very good, blended seamlessly with Jim Caviezel as he is whipped with an array of weapons.  It adds a tension building element that makes you cringe and has you telling the purveyors of the beating to stop.  One might even question if Christ could have remained conscious throughout the experience, being that he was in human form.  But that is potentially a much greater argument.  With all the hype that led up to this movie, I expected it to be more graphic.  But as an avid movie goer, I didn't find it any worse then some horror movies.  But it was more realistic obviously as to what would happen to a man if these atrocities were inflicted on him.  Thankfully Mel adds a resurrection scene at the end to lighten the darkness, I wish this scene had been a little longer.  I highly recommend the movie, not only as a powerful tragedy, but as an emotional drama that can affect anyone, no matter what religion, if they watch it for what it is; a man who sacrifices himself for the greater good of humanity.	5.0	A painful story	2004-12-30	14	9	5

I dont quite understand where all the controversy comes from. It represents the gospel. If anyone can show me where the gospel doesn't speak about the scourging of christ then please by all means prove me wrong.When I first saw this film, I wasnt quite sure what to expect from Mel Gibson. I guess a somewhat sugar coating, many of the other biblical films made have given.If you know the gospel then you would know that the last hours of jesus' life were brutal.I can absolutely appreciate the tender moments placed in the film, the flash back to the sermon on the mount being one in particular. As tender moments with his mother.Though I have heard Mel say that he placed certain scene's as a place to escape to from the violence, but for me it was those scene's that brought the most emotion out of me. This film is truely like no other, if you havent seen this film, I recommend reading the gospel from the book of mathew on, so you will have a clear understanding of the life and ministries of Jesus Christ. And from that you will come to understand the message of love that he adamantly preached,and the ultimate sacrifice of giving his human life to save us from our sins.After and during this film, I could do nothing but weep. I Wept out of complete humility and devotion.Its a very moving peace of work! A job very well done by Mel Gibson!	5.0	a true representation of the gospel	2004-06-25	12	6	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A30UZV401OSGJP	Jennie	I was very unsure about the story of the crucifixion being glamorised for the sake of Hollywood and 'cashed in on' so i went to the film full of apprehension.I am so very glad i went, i cannot explain how moved i was, how humbled and full of awe. I am glad it was violent, i am glad that i saw so much blood and pain and weeping. I am glad that Mel Gibson didn't shy away from the harsh reality that was Christs death, and i am glad that in parts i felt quite sick. I have only been a Christian for a year, and have heard so many times that 'Jesus suffered on the cross for my sins' but could never really comprehend that. We live in such a sanitised way, and the real brutality of the crucifixion is glazed over each Easter, but we should know, we should be aware of the sacrifice that was made for us. I have never taken communion, simply because i couldn't understand what it meant, sometimes it just felt like words, Now I can't wait, now i am as close to understanding the sacrifice as I could be.I think that the criticisms of the film are ridiculous, It never occurred to me that the film was anti Jew, I was shocked to hear that people thought this after i saw the film, most importantly I don't think that Jews were portrayed badly, no worse than anyone else, (no-one is complaining about it being anti Roman) but secondly; its history, the next time they make a film about world war two will they criticise the director for being anti German?I read a review in my local paper, apparently the Bishop of my borough has said that the film dwelt too long on the violence of the crucifixion, i was shocked by this, surely to understand the sacrifice we must dwell on it, the Christian faith is about Jesus, he was born the son of God, he died for us a horrific death and rose from the dead. How are we not supposed to dwell on this?Anyway... go and see the film, take your friends to go and see the film, and watch how everyone acts once its over.	5.0	A film that does exactly what it intended....	2004-03-28	3	1	2

NOT for the faint of heart, or for children, but anyone over the age of 15 would benefit from a viewing. There is no anti semitism, and from what I could tell, was true to the Biblical Gospel interpretation. Any variations were miniscule and were of the type that, ""could have happened"" (ie, Mary remembering her son falling and her picking him up as a child...in scripture, no, does it matter? NO!)and were tastefully done.Anyhow, the movie is great! Five stars, no problem. I do wish that the DVD had some special features though.

I don't think anyone could have done any better.I believe that Mel Gibson was following GOD in this and I appreciate that someone will stand up for what he believes in and not be ashamed to say that he is a Christian and He loves GOD.As for me, I give it 5 stars, and recommend everyone to watch it.

Once it was out on DVD I immediately purchase it and after seeing it, it has touched me very deeply, I am also a Christian.  Mel Gibson had done a marvelous job at showing the world what it would've been like for Jesus Christ the day he was crucified. Jesus Christ deserves respect and admiration for what he went through for what he believed in and Mel Gibson has done a fantastic job at showing people how it would've been like.It's an incredible masterpiece that helps to better understand the life and meaning of Jesus Christ. It defiantly helped me better understand all the pain and suffering he went through. Through reading the Gospels and watching The Passion of the Christ, everything came into synch of what He did.Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance was worth an Oscar. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of being Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera; you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. The makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and ""the passion"" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1PNNR3B9H8GTC	Jeremy Berman	Even after the passage of half a year, I still vividly remember my arrival at the screening room where I was to review Mel Gibson's controversial new movie The Passion of the Christ. I was stunned to find a vast majority of the audience staring at the blank screen in stony, nervous silence. Many of these individuals had journeyed to the theater on a chilly Wednesday evening in the hopes of viewing a faith-affirming and reverential retelling of Jesus Christ's final 12 hours on Earth (as recorded in the Gospels). Others can come to determine if the film was as gruesomely violent and virulently anti-Semitic as many critics and religious leaders had proclaimed. Every person in the room was waiting doggedly to be either moved and heartened by Gibson's spiritual ecstasy or revolted by the brutality and prejudice of a cinematic travesty. It was clear to me immediately that I was dealing with a movie so provocative and polarizing that it could frighten and compel an audience of people who had not even seen it yet. Now, with the release of the movie on DVD imminent, I feel it is prudent to reflect on this unique and controversial piece of cinema in a calm and rational manner. You are entitled disagree with some of my opinions (I admit to not being a Christian, but I have tremendous respect for all religions and a strong belief in God), but I beg you to hear me out and reserve any final judgments until you have finished this review.The film I watched was sometimes as beautiful and moving as the devout among us had hoped, but often as harsh and nasty and the cynics in the audience had feared. This is without a doubt one of the most unrelentingly violent movies ever produced, with enough vicious beatings and flowing blood to make The Silence of the Lambs and Natural Born Killers look like Disney films. In the hands of his Roman tormenters, Jesus is chained to a post and whipped with powerful sticks and a cat-of-nine-tails with hooks until almost every inch of his body is covered in cuts and sours. He is spit on, slapped, punched and pummeled more times than any person could hope to count. When Jesus is nailed to the cross near the film's conclusion, the audience gets to see the dull nails obliterate his flesh and hear his bones cracked by the additional beatings of the Roman soldiers. I deeply respect Gibson's desire to portray the suffering Jesus endured in an honest manner, but after a couple of hours such displays of violence come across sickening and gratuitous. I was so desensitized and disheartened by these violent acts that I was unable to find inspiration in Jesus' bravery and perseverance in the face of danger. The abundance of violence also prevented me from gaining a greater understanding of Jesus' philosophy of tolerance, devotion and brotherhood. There is precious little screen time devoted to Jesus' teachings and sermons, and these sequences (usually presented as flashbacks) are often stilted and unconvincing. Still, I should note that many people that I love and respect have found the violence in this film to be appropriate and moving, so perhaps I would have to become a Christian to truly appreciate and understand it.Although the Romans are depicted as Christ's most prominent oppressors, he is also tormented and abused by the prominent rabbi Caiphus and his counsel of high Jewish priests. Since many people are reluctant to see this movie because of the alleged anti-Semitism it contains, I feel I should discuss this issue at length for the benefit of potential DVD buyers. Caiphus is presented as a bloodthirsty and unsympathetic tyrant who demands that Jesus be crucified for having the audacity to claim that he is the Messiah. He turns Jesus over to the Romans without a second thought and later brings an angry throng of Jews before a ridiculously weak-willed Pontius Pilate to loudly demand the death of Jesus. Pilate is deeply conflicted about murdering a man that he can find no series fault with, but he ultimately relents to the will of the high priest and orders Jesus crucified. These cartoonish images of Jewish villainy have led many to dismiss the film as anti-Semitic garbage, and they certainly damage the historical credibility of the movie (however, since Gibson was only concerned about being faithful to the Gospels, which are personal accounts that are not neccessarily as historically consistent or politically correct as some would like, maybe this isn't a fair complaint). However, many historians believe that Caiphus and the other Jewish priests were reluctant to turn Jesus over to the Roman authorities, but did so to prevent Jesus from cultivating a following big enough to bring down the wrath of the hostile Roman Empire on the entire Jewish population. Additionally, Pontius Pilate was, by all accounts, a cruel an inflexible ruler who hardly needed the encouragement or permission of a powerless minority group to execute a troublemaker.Gibson may have exaggerated the wrongdoings of some Jewish individuals, but he also presents several positive and heroic Jewish figures. The character Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus bear his cross when he is too weak to perform the task himself, and movingly risks his own life to defend Christ from further Roman abuse. Other Jews chastise Caiphus for his intolerance towards Jesus and wail with grief when they see Jesus' mangled body being dragged through the streets by the Romans. Ultimately, I don't think this film can be truly described as Anti-Semitic. It presents a wide range of Jewish characters that act in accordance with their personal beliefs and are not representative of the religious group as a whole. Fear of anti-Semitism is not a valid reason to avoid this movie!Thus far, I have primarily focused on the aspects of this film that disturbed me. I must make it clear that The Passion of the Christ is not a film without numerous merits. Gibson is a gifted filmmaker, and many of his visual and dramatic devices are dramatically riveting. I was particularly impressed with the depiction of the devil as a shrouded, voyeuristic woman, the use of a raindrop as the starting point of a stunning earthquake, and a brightly lit resurrection sequence that left much of the audience beaming. The performances are universally superb (particularly the passionate and emotionally vivid turns by Jim Caviezal as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern as the Virgin Mary), and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography perfectly captures the agony and the ecstasy of this momentous tail.I almost regret having to give this movie a star grade. The Passion is simply too complex and polarizing to be accessed so easily. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to gain a greater understanding of Christian history or simply put the controversy surrounding this film into perspective.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1IBSQQHGCDUAN	"Jeremy Ulrey ""Bangyrmfhead"""	"Back in 1988, Martin Scorsese suffered through a great deal of controversy due to his fictionalized imaginings of Jesus' human characteristics in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".  Now, sixteen years later, Mel Gibson comes under similar scrutiny, but though it is easy to draw comparisons between the two cases, it's the differences that shed the most light on ""The Passion of the Christ"".  First of all, Gibson's take is faithful to the source material in the extreme, which is completely the opposite of what got Scorsese into trouble.  The controversy over ""The Passion..."" isn't whether it's blasphemous -- I don't think I've heard a single person claim that it is -- but whether the visceral depiction of Christ's sufferings were gratuitous or necessary to get the point across.  The purpose of this review is solely to examine this central question, as I believe it's crucial to whether or not this is a great film or merely a good one.  Hopefully, by the time I'm done, I'll have elucidated myself with enough detail that you'll be able to tell without seeing the film whether you agree or disagree, and if the latter, whether you would have a contrary opinion of the film's quality as well.First of all, I hold true that - in fact - the mere depiction of Jesus' torture in graphically realistic terms is NOT an end in and of itself.  To claim the opposite to me would be to give credence to the type of people who stand outside state capitols hoisting posters of mangled fetuses -- whether you're for or against abortion, in other words, your decision should be based on sound ethical arguments and not how gruesome the surgical procedure itself actually is.  Similarly, it would be the utmost of shallowness to base one's faith in Christ in feeling sorry for the guy for the physical pain he went through.  This almost seems common sensically obvious once stated as such, but one can never belie the sway a good ""tear jerker"" has over the emotions of it's audience.  So with the above conjectures laid out, it seems that we must by necessity rule out the value of the film based solely on the historical authenticity of it's depiction.  But what else does it have to offer if authenticity will not suffice?Honestly, the authenticity seems to be where Gibson is laying most of his cards, although ""The Passion..."" is far from the droll sterility of, say, ""The Alamo"", to use another historically authentic (yet dramatically static) example.  Jim Caviezel as Christ does everything you could ask out of him given the demands of the script:  he's assertive, secure in his beliefs, and displays a certain kind of humanity, although Gibson's treatment of Christ in this respect demands a different kind of humanity than Scorsese wrought out of Willem Defoe.  This Christ is not unsure of his heritage and his mission, only his ability to withstand the physical consequences he will have to endure.  And, true to his mission, Gibson certainly puts Caviezal's Christ through the wringer.  In fact, even if you're willing to accept that the concept of historic authenticity is riveting in and of it's own right, it's hard not to feel that Gibson may be going a little overboard here.  By the time Jesus is finished being put through his scourging, it's already become hard to believe that a human being could withstand as much punishment and continue to live.  Even if he'd suddenly been pardoned before the Crucifixion, in other words, it's impossible to believe that a mortal man could have healed from the wounds inflicted during the scourging, and without this dramatic element the journey to the Cross cannot help but be an anti-climax by comparison.Ultimately, I think even the most devout Christians would have to agree that the compelling story of Christ is not by what abuse of the flesh he met his demise, but by what persecution and theological uncertainty he lived his life up until then.  Without that there would be no story of Christ to pass down over the millenia, as history reveals that Christ was not by any means unique in the extremes of his physical torment, torture being a fairly commonplace device up until very recent times (and with the sketchy revelations of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, who's to say even now this is the case?).  By this measure I'd have to give the nod to Scorsese's film, historically inaccurate or no, as at least it goes to some lengths to try and understand what a born mortal would have to come to grips with given Christ's pedigree.Ultimately, ""The Passion of the Christ"" tells us next to nothing about Christ's mission on Earth -- someone who had by some means escaped any previous mention of Christianity would certainly not be able to piece together it's tenets based on what they have to go on here -- which leaves nothing else to judge but the merits of a blow-by-blow orgy of violence against the alleged Messiah.  In brief segments, Jesus is shown in flashbacks preaching to his flock, but these segments are short and fragmentary, not so much underlining what it is that Jesus was sacrificing himself for as contrasting the ""good old days"" when he was flying underneath the political radar, free from the later tyrannical fallout of the dominant religious groups, and as these scenes in their brevity and the sense of their editing fail to provide the film with a dualistic message, we must once again fall back on the central thesis that historical vivacity is an end in it's own right.  Hopefully we have shown in pertinent detail why this cannot be the case."	3.0	B-	2005-08-19	8	4	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3OGFN54LP9Y5D	"J. Evans ""musical maven"""	"I was originally determined to avoid this film, given the fundamentalist and reportedly bizarre theology of the director.  But upon reading a review in Commonweal I decided to see it.  I went on Palm Sunday, and it was one of the most profound experiences of my life.  Doctrinally, it was faithful to the gospel of John, with nothing extraneous added.  As a film, it was brilliant.  Most moving was the relationship between Jesus and his Mother Mary, and her full participation in his suffering.  Gibson's vision made the whole thing seem so human, and so inevitable.  The acting was superb,(and the portrayal of Evil in the guise of the mysterious androgyne an inspired touch), and I felt moved as I had never been before by the events of the Passion.  For once, I was able to identify with a film Jesus, and to understand more fully why he had to do what he did.  Who of us has never been faced with making the choice between what was right and what would be more gratifying to us, between action and avoidance.  I couldn't get the film out of my head, and went to see it again on Easter Sunday.  I still think about it.  The bloodiness was necessary, as the film was essentially a reinactment of a sacrificial blood ritual, and His blood, allegorically as well as physically, spattered and fell upon both tormentor and innocent alike, washing all with it's cleansing redemption.  This film changed my life, and I think Something was working through Mel Gibson; perhaps the proberbial 'Left Hand of God.'  I now have a framed poster of ""The Passion...."", (the one with the head of Jesus and the crown of thorns), hanging over my bed.  This movie brought me 'home' after having been away for so long.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2YI3SU5THQUQZ	J. F Foster	As an evangelical Christian, I am probably among the voices who should be celebrating this film.  And on a certain level, I will do so.  But in the end, this is a film that not only takes license with the Biblical accounts of the Passion, but in my view, is a film that misses the whole point of the Gospel.Much has been made of the violence of the movie, and it is indeed quite violent in spots.  Such violence, while intense, is not objectionable for those wanting a realistic portrayal of Roman torture and execution methods.  Such torture and death is what happened to criminals under sentence of death or extreme punishment.  We may not like it, but it serves little purpose to water the violence down for modern day consumption, and thus assist modern day viewers in downplaying what Jesus did.  In this respect, the movie is good.Much has also been made of the alleged anti-Semitism of the movie.  This, I suppose, is in the eyes of the beholder.  The Roman soldiers, in my view, are portrayed much more harshly than the Jewish religious leaders.  However, as I will mention below, the Sanhedrin does look quite bad in light of what I consider to be the major failure of the movie.While the chief priests are portrayed as stalwart in their desire to have Jesus executed, many others involved in the process, most notably Pilate, are portrayed as being deeply convicted about their role.  Pilate is portrayed ultimately as a pragmatic man who permits the crucifixion to go forward because he thinks it's in his own political self-interest to do so.Among the liberties taken in this movie are the opening encounter with Satan in the Garden of Gethsemane, a number of quotes made by Jesus during his trial and afterward, and that the sign placed on the Cross is obviously wrong from a Biblical perspective, since it does not include the Greek inscription.  All of these, while regretable, are not the biggest problem.In my view, this movie fundamentally lacks a proper theological context for the Passion of Christ.  In particular, Gibson, like many, seems to have missed the whole point of the crucifixion.  The crucifixion was not chiefly about Jesus suffering at the hands of men, no matter how bad that may have been.  The crucifixion is about Jesus paying for the sins of His people through substitution.  These sins had to be atoned for, and it is through the crucifixion that God's radical love AND radical justice are most intensely demonstrated.  Jesus did not die so that we may love one another, or so we can pray for those who persecute us.  Such things represent Kingdom ethics that true followers of Him should embody, no doubt.  Jesus died to save people from the judgment their own sins cry out for, and as part of this mission, endured the full wrath of a perfectly holy and just God for the sins of countless numbers of people.  This, not the torture of the Romans, is the primary and most intense suffering that Jesus endured on the Cross, and yet this is simply not presented in the film to any real degree.  It is my view that this film does not provide the sufficient theological context to view the sufferings of Jesus within a truly Biblical framework.  Instead, I suspect that many will walk away from this film with only a partial understanding of what Jesus did, and little understanding of why He did what He did, and why any of it really matters to sinners today.  And since this is the central focus of the New Testament, a depiction of Jesus that fails to put the substitutional and atoning ministry of Jesus in view when presenting His work fails to do justice to both.I think Christians should see this movie, and I think they should bring interested non-Christians with them.  But discerning Christians need to critique this film as well, not just non-Christian critics.  The Passion of Christ is about so much more than what Gibson presents here, and Christians above all people should be prepared to fill out the story that Gibson leaves only partially told.	3.0	Good, but could have been much better	2004-03-06	11	5	6

People were used throughout history to forfill a destiny.Even Judas fate was sad to me as it seemed to fullfill the phrophesy and yet was regreted almost immediately upon reflection.Part of the confrontation however, I believe, was to bring the gentiles band in to the fold.

Every actor searches for a role that will define his skills and be a part of his being. The role of Jesus will be such a role for James Caviezel. This is a movie that causes us to look at the history of the time and how politics, greed, and fear combine to create suffering for an innocent Jesus. Whether one is a believer or not, one has to look at the screen as a canvas where Mel Gibson as an artist uses Caviezel as his instrument to create a masterpiece. It causes one to be humble in the presence of such power and glory. Thank You Mel and Thank You James for sharing your commitment and passion with the world.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3EM8B46K4C833	jimmy	"I'd been looking forward to seeing this film since the day I first read a rumour that Mel Gibson was going to do a film about the Passion entirely in Latin and Aramaic. I knew this was going to be a very special film long before it made headlines and became the centre of great and unnecessary controversy. Yesterday I was not disappointed. Josh Sewell has already put it more elegantly than I can when he writes, ""I've been rendered nearly speechless... The Passion of the Christ... defies the typical 'it's good' or 'it's bad' mentality of a review. It's so visually gripping, so heart-wrenching and so emotionally draining that writing about it simply can't do it justice.""The film begins at night in the garden of Gethsemane in Jerusalem. Jesus (played by Jim Caviezel, an actor I have great respect for ever since his excellent performance in Kevin Reynolds' film of The Count of Monte Cristo) is betrayed by his disciple Judas to the high priest Caiaphas and, next morning, brought before Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator of Judaea. Originally, Gibson had intended The Passion of the Christ not to have subtitles, saying that the acting was to convey enough of the story for subtitles to be superfluous. Later he compromised and had the film subtitled. The subtitles do make the details of the story clear, so this particular compromise was not a bad decision, but I suspect from the generally quite stylised acting that Gibson still intended not to have subtitles while he was shooting. That the Passion was filmed entirely in Latin and Aramaic was a stroke of genius, and part of the great lengths Gibson went to in order to achieve a sense of historical accuracy. I certainly cannot fault his portrayal of the Romans: they do admittedly speak Latin with an Italian accent (partly because the actors are Italian, partly because they were coached by a Jesuit who presumably pronounces Latin consonants the medieval or modern Italian way), but they speak it fluently, as if it really were their everyday speech, and all of them look right and act perfectly, and their clothing, armour, weapons and hairstyles are completely accurate as far as I know. Pilate himself is actually played by a Bulgarian (which is audible in the way he pronounces the letter L) who really looks the part and manages to convey a lot of powerful emotions restrained by military and political discipline.Caiaphas demands that Jesus be executed for blasphemy. Pilate refuses but, terrified that he will have a bloody uprising on his hands which will result in his own execution on the orders of the Emperor, orders his second in command, Abenader, to have Jesus severely punished in the hope of appeasing Caiaphas. Abenader unwittingly delegates the task to a group of sadistic soldiers who cane Jesus and then, probably provoked by his incredible stoicism, scourge him. The scourging is one of the most horrific and bloody scenes I have ever seen, and rightly so. The film has been criticised for being sadomasochistic, a criticism that is idiotic. We are bombarded every day with scenes of violence intended as entertainment, desensitising us to our detriment. The Passion of the Christ shows violence for what it really is in all its true, disgusting, dehumanising horror, a horror that takes on a further dimension when I consider, through my tears, that I have just paid to watch a man being ripped to shreds while the people all around me munch loudly on popcorn.Caiaphas is not satisfied and demands that Jesus be crucified. Pilate tries one last time to avert the inevitable. He tells the mob that they can save one condemned man from execution and tells them to choose between Jesus and Barabbas, a murderer. To his disbelief the mob choose to pardon Barabbas. Jesus is to be crucified.Another criticism of the film has been that it is unrealistic in that, amongst other things, Jesus is forced to carry his cross to Golgotha after having been mortally scourged. Do I need to point out the irony here? When Jesus falls on the way and seems unable to continue, the accompanying Roman soldiers rope in the unwilling Simon to share his burden. When Jesus falls again, Simon finds that the cross the horrifically injured Jesus managed to carry a part of the way on his own cannot be born by an able-bodied (but mortal) man.Finally, the crucifixion. As Josh Sewell points out, ""Most films about Jesus... make crucifixion seem slightly unpleasant"". The Passion of the Christ shows exactly what this hideous form of execution really entailed.The most widespread and unjust criticism of The Passion of the Christ is that it is anti-Semitic. How anyone can make such an accusation and how anyone can take it seriously beats me. It is Roman soldiers who cane Jesus, who scourge him, who beat him, insult him, spit on him, press a crown of thorns onto his head and crucify him, all on the orders of a Roman procurator. And nobody in their right mind would ever accuse the film of being anti-Italian, just as I have never heard anyone accusing, say, Schindler's List of being anti-German or The Lord of the Rings of being anti-Orc. Ridiculous doesn't even begin to describe such accusations. Probably the only reservations I myself have against the film are that not all the actors pull their weight: in my opinion, Mary, Simon and John are all very weakly portrayed.Ultimately, The Passion of the Christ is not even a proselytising film. It is a film about the tragedy of mankind: about man's bloodlust, about his inexhaustible cruelty to his fellow man, about his cowardice, conformity and hypocrisy, about the pleasure he takes in the suffering of others, and about his fatal lack of empathy and compassion."	5.0	What this film is really about	2005-03-08	16	14	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3RB6NQOLOBXYD	"Jimmy Lee ""James"""	I just want to start out by saying that Mel gibson is a genius, I mean he took a risk funding this movie with 30 million dollars, but it payed off big time. lets be honest here this guy really knows how to put a quality flick on screen, Braveheart, Man without a Face, and Now the Passion. I'm just mentioning the movies he directed not including the movies he starred in, I could go on forever with those movies. Anyway I have to admit I was blown away on how realistic the Passion was.  Everything is accurate right down to the nitty gritty. Sure it is graphic but were talking thousands of years ago, people were ruthless back then. There are no tricks or twists, Mel Gibson keeps it very organized and gets to the point. The music and acting is stunning I give much respect to Jim Caveizel he did a great job along with his mother Mary and Pontius Pilot. At first I was hesitate of the Hebrew subtitles, but Mel Gibson does a great job of keeping the dialogue very simple. Also The strong emotional scenes kind of speaks for itself so I guess you really don't need much dialogue. I am also glad how Mel Gibson basically screwed Hollywood, I mean obviously he wasn't going to win any Academy Awards because of the subject matter not to mention like 80% of Hollywood is Jewish. but since this movie  was going to bring an anti-semitic wave which it DIDN'T I might add it couldn't get one academy award, Ridiculous! But it is great to see this master piece gross over 700 Million dollars, he basically shut the academy awards up with that. Besides that, the dvd is great too, although no special features are included which I'm not surprised at either, the movie speaks for itself. I personally would rather have a better quality movie with no special feaures than a 4-disc set with an awful picture. The quality is amazing though. This movie probably is one the highest quality looking movies ever. The sound which is in DTS. 5.1 hebrew aramic surround sound is stunning, all of my speakers get attention. The transfer is very clean with bright colors. This movie is deff. worth checking out, its accurate, emotional, and very powerful.

Mel Gibson's portrayal of Christ's last 12 hours is pictured with love and cruelty in both extremes.

It is brutal yes but I think Gibson just wanted viewers to feel Jesus' pain that he went through for us. He definetly succeeded in that. The film is also uplifting though during the flashback scenes of Jesus when he's not being brutally whipped. However they don't last that long and cut right back to him being tortured horribly. I'd say the moviemakes the people that whip and torture Jesus look the worse as they actually enjoy whipping and putting him through pain. They are clearly horrible men and do you feel terrible for Jesus for going through this brutal beating for us ? Yes. I mean no one would ever...ever want to go through what he did.James Caviezel brings a great  warmth to the role and is his best performance period. When it comes to oscar time he shouldn't just be nominated...he should win. Gibson also does his best direction but the movie wouldn't have been as great if he didn't have such a talented actor playing Jesus. The film is brutal and painful to watch but in between all that it's also uplifting and powerful. It's a very important film and hey someone had to make it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AKW28NK422O3C	J. Lay	I found the movie quite gory however I didn't feel connected to the movie at all. All I felt was pity for a historical man. I think it should be seen as a historical point of view rather than spiritual. True it looks as though it was anti-semitic but this was true in history at that point of time but doesn't mean it was all the Jews fault that killed him. I don't think that Christians nor other people should think this is all historically accurate. Don't believe all sources from the gospels because some of the sources are changed and biased. Anyways the film was good but I didn't connect it spiritually or anything it was based more on the physical pain more then anything else.	3.0	All gore, no emotion	2004-12-20	10	5	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1H5P8121Z0OKF	J. Lay II	Despite the strange character portrayals (Satan, Pilate) and gory violence (possibly the bloodiest movie yet), 'Passion' has many enduring moments. Scenes such as Mary rushing to help her son during his fateful walk to the hill at Golgotha, as well as Christ passing on his duties as son before his death are indeed unforgettable.James Caviezel portrays Christ with riveting authenticity, See for yourself.This movie is gripping and visceral, definitely worth seeing for persons of every faith. Film critics immediately attacked Mel Gibson's portrayal of the Jewish people in this film, setting in motion a massive publicity bonfire that fed the flames of the movie's success. Personally, I felt the presentation of the Jewish people was roughly parallel to that of the New Testament account within the Bible (with the exception of the demon kids, and additional punishment to Christ on his way to trial). The controversy surrounding this picture was immense, Hollywood was outraged but helpless to stop the film's release due mainly to the heavy audience pull and box office power of Mel Gibson(who also wrote,directed and starred in the violent smash-hit Braveheart). Movie-goers were intrigued by the growing controversy as well as Gibson's sudden, and intense faith-based statements. This film was most successful amongst protestant Christians here in the US, Entire churches bought out showings all over the country and helped to push the already controversy-driven box office gross past the $300 million mark. A landmark blockbuster was unleashed, What will Gibson create next?	3.0	Strange, Bloody, Enduring...	2007-04-09	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3C4I89M62JW6G	"J. Lee ""dash2k4"""	This is a film that you either think is accurate or it isn't. I myself thought it was mostly &quot;realistic,&quot; though of course none of us were there when these things happened (the fact that Jesus lived is beyond debate) and therefore cannot judge if the events are entirely &quot;accurate.&quot; It is certainly is hard to judge this film if one includes religious bias. Technically, the film was very well done and gets bonus points for the Aramaic and Roman dialogues. The details were well-studied and reflective of Palestine under Roman rule. The classes of people were accurately represented. The setting was nearly perfect, because I've been to Jerusalem and cannot tell that the film was shot hundreds of miles away in Italy (perhaps owing to the Roman influence in both places?). The script is extremely close to the words of the Bible, though some parts remained somewhat inconsistent (such as the order of Jesus' words in certain scenarios).On the sentimental side, Gibson should not be judged for his execution, because he wanted it to be accurate. If someone finds fault with his direct approach, then I guess that person is blaming the Bible. Some people were offended that Jesus didn't run for his life, saying that this is entirely unrealistic and unChristian-like. However, the Bible says exactly that: that Jesus had several opportunities to free himself and not even go to Jerusalem in the first place. This is one example of Gibson's steadfastness to the &quot;original&quot; script, and I believe that had he altered things to make them more sensible, the movie would have suffered a lot.On the whole, a movie you'll want to watch just out of curiosity. If you're Christian, it's not to be missed because it will shake you up. If you are of another religion or atheist, it will be rather like watching another historical persecution of a sinless Man.	4.0	Very good dramatization	2004-08-02	9	7	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A15TGJVTMNH0MW	"J. Moon ""terrapinjer03"""	Let me preface this by saying that I am not the most religious person out there. I actually went with the intention of being thoroughly disappointed and wanting my money back. HOWEVER, this is an artistic masterpiece. Regardless of your religious preferences, you should see this movie. Gibson relates the 12 hours leading to the death of Christ in a series of flashbacks, beatings, and stunning cinematography. His choice of doing this movie in Latin and Aramaic was correct; it would not be nearly as powerful if performed in English. Jim Clavizel has little match with the intensity that his eyes convey. Gibson also adds nuances and flourishes to the story (the Satan character and the demons that hound Judas) that add so much to this movie.A lot has been written concerning the anti-semitism this movie conveys, and I'd strongly recommend that you see the movie and reserve your opinions on that until you've actually seen the movie. I don't really blame the Jews for the crucifiction, and I think Gibson utilizes the mob as a tool of Satan, and that really shows in the movie. Also, the gore is definitely present, and you should not see this if you have a weak stomach. However, it is dispersed throughout the movie, and after that first horrible whipping, you don't notice it as much. I definitely think that everyone should see this once. I don't think it has much repeat viewing value, as I was thoroughly impressed with it, but like a Schindler's List, have no desire to see it again.	4.0	Worth Renting, would you watch it more than once?	2004-07-26	13	10	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A303RM5J75FRPF	J. M. Wrenn	"I'm assuming you know what this is about, so i'll skip the plotline and jump straight to the commentary...Jesus is the epitomy of complexity, honesty, and passion, and he suffered to an unbelieveable extent.  Even if you're a non-believer, you must admit that He is one of the coolest role models ever.  I was really hoping that director Mel Gibson would have dealt with the deeper issues that Jesus had, but he falls flat.The beginning of the film was dark and full of intrigue, but all I can recall after that is a whole lot of senseless violence.  The Jews are pissed, and persecution ensues.  The Romans are also on the scene, and proceed to beat the bejesus out of Jesus.  That's pretty much the jist of it, with some sparse flashbacks that fail to provide much depth.  Lots of beating...slow motion, repetitive, bloody...not for the squeamish.  Some found this powerful or shocking, I found it excessive.The sound and cinematography here are quite impressive, as is the acting of Jim Caviezel as JC.  I wish I could say more positive things, but I was just so utterly let down by this film.I recommend Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" as a much more interesting movie about Jesus, as well as Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" which is the kind of film I wish that Gibson had made.  ""The Passion of The Christ"" is all blood, but no guts."	2.0	This is a movie we're talking about, right?	2005-01-22	24	9	15

Granted, it was awful and the movie does do a wonderful job of portraying the gore.  Although, I still do not know what value this has?  There were many others then who experienced the same thing, as there are many today who experience equally gruesome torture (even including people who have stood for justice & righteousness - just as Jesus did...but should this even be a requirement for humane treatment?).Summary: Too much painful imagery; not enough of the beatitudes	1.0	Lost Focus	2005-10-17	33	15	18
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2T1HWMP3JMN09	Joan Harder	Never has there been a movie that has gripped the very soul, as this one did mine.Mel Gibson has made a stand for Jesus Christ that will shake the world.  He openly states how his life has changed since he met the real Christ, as only we can when we give our selves completely, mind, soul and body to Him.  The Christ who died for the sins of the world.If anyone rejects the violence in the film, they most certainly reject Christ himself. Jesus was a Jew. He was sent here to earth to live as a man. Who killed Jesus Christ? We all did. Every human that lives and has lived on this earth.I am very proud of Mel for the stand he has made in Hollywood and the world.  He is a very fine man and I admire him for making this effort to shake up this world that has gone array.May God bless him abundantly.	5.0	The Passion of Christ	2004-04-13	10	4	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2SXVZW3CGQ82I	"Jo Anne Harrison ""Lady Hawkwind"""	I was expecting the second coming with this movie, the way that everyone was pushing it on me.  I wasn't impressed by the story line.  It was more depressing to watch a man get beat up, moreso than a representation of the Christ.  The movie was more based on a 19th century nun's account (this has been publicly acknowledged by Gibson himself) than on the Biblical account of the four gospels, which was disturbing to me.  I was sympathetic to the character, as the violence against him was hard to watch, but it was just a movie role. I could not see the character as more than an actor in a movie role, even though many people almost associate the man in the movie with the historical Christ. Also, I sympathized with the mother, and shed a tear for her in her grief.  I was a bit taken aback by the insinuation of anti-semitism in the movie, though.I didn't think the movie was as earth-shattering as some make it out to be, but rather saw it on its own merits, to which I agree with the critics - this is a Mel Gibson vision of what possibly might have gone on during the crucifixion of the Christ, rather than a historic account.  I took on this merit, rather than being starstruck by either Gibson, nor Christ's story.The movie is more depressing than life-changing or encouraging. Gibson could have emphasized a passionate hope and positive aspects of what the Christ died for, but chose instead to show a more violent, depressing view of what he envisions it must have been like.  Gibson is entitled to his views, but since no one was there, it is only Gibson's view and not a historically or traditionally accurate depiction of the crucifixion.	2.0	I wasn't awestruck over the movie	2005-02-27	8	3	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3FFOC68BRL6FO	"Joan Saraceno ""Rock Hogan"""	"On February 25, 2004 at 5:30 PM, I wasn't exactly sure how to feel because I was sitting in front of a screen that was ready to project what's been called one of the most controversial and brutal films ever made. I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn't sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is.""The Passion,"" as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson's finest work (he had previously directed ""Bravehart"" and ""The Man Without a Face,"" two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that's how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way that passion could never be conveyed.Every frame of Gibson's work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as ""The Natural"" and ""The Patriot."" To further Mel's perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney's score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.As a film reviewer, it's not my job to do what I really don't want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn't, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that's all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let's think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people you put in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that's anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there's enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that's all I have to say about that.Bottom line, it's not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn't a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and ""the passion"" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs. You will be moved by this great motion picture epic, I guarantee it.Grade: A++ (first ever)-Rock Hogan"	5.0	"""The Passion of the Christ"" Not A Movie, An Experience"	2005-08-20	20	11	9

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A14N1SJ9RFMDSE	Job	"Save your time and your money.  Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a waste of both.  Clearly Gibson recognized the lesson of James Cameron's Titanic; people will layout big bucks to see a well-known story made ""real"" by applying the visuals.Banking on the fact that the world's Christians would pay to see the passion made ""real"", Mel has cranked out an evil and ugly movie; dark, haunted and brutal, backed by a dissonant rock music track.  I assume the point was to show Jesus' suffering in a manner that would enhance the faith of the viewer, by allowing us to witness the suffering first hand.  The film requires that one know the story.  Without a Christian background, it is completely disjointed and out of context.The tragedy of the final product is best understood if one tries to see the film as a nonbeliever.  I suggest this approach, because the believer sees a confirmation of their faith, not the actual film.  They see the film as a historically accurate portrayal of the story they know.  It is anything but that.The inaccuracies begin with language.  While the Hebrews of the period did indeed speak Aramaic, the official administrative language of Judea was Greek.  Pilate would have addressed the Jewish crowd in Greek.There is no scriptural evidence or indication of the mysterious relationship between Jesus and his Mother; nothing that says she knew he was imprisoned below ground, nothing that says she was present when he was scourged, much less mopped up his blood.The books of Matthew and Mark say simply, that He was ""scourged.""  In Roman law this was typically done with a reed, which is consistent with the Gospels.  The varieties of implements used in Gibson's portrayal are a choice he made to make the scourging more brutal and therefore more ""real"".  There is nothing in the scripture that indicates the Roman guards took such delight in beating him and nothing that indicates that they had to be ordered to stop.The Bible says, they mocked Him, spat on Him and put the crown of thorns on His head.  There is no scriptural indication that they were beating Him at every step on the way to Golgotha.  These are dark fictions.Dark fiction may, after all, have been the point.  Gibson's most disturbing contrivance is the constant presence of evil, personified as an androgynous Satan.  He is present at Gethsemane, he is present throughout Jesus suffering, mocking, almost gloating.  At one point he/she mockingly appears as a Satanistic parody of the Madonna and Child.  In the garden, when Satan reaches for Jesus with a serpent, its head is crushed, but to no avail.  As the movie progresses, time and again, the images of evil triumph.In the end, Mary is seen kissing the foot of Christ on the cross; His blood on her face, in her mouth and she almost licks her lips!This is why I suggest trying to see this work through non-Christian eyes, because in doing so, absent the context of the rest of the Bible, this is a story in which evil triumphs.Your money and your time would be much better spent on a copy of Ishtar with Warren Beatty."	1.0	Think Again	2005-02-04	45	22	23

This film is a plausible ""realistic"", masterfully-crafted attempt at showing what this historical figure, Jesus, went through -- for better or worse.  You may not be willing (open minded enough?) to be able to accept that Jesus was actually divine, and if so, this movie will indeed just be a meaningless gorefest to you.  But facts are facts.  The things we take for granted, such as the essential dignity of the human person, that just so happen to make trivial innovations such as democracy a plausible form of government, are Christian in origin.  Eleven of twelve apostles, who witnessed THE Passion firsthand, wouldn't willingly undergo martyrdom just to pull off a hoax for a lunatic or an egomaniac.Nor is it to be close-minded or ignorant to be Christian (as the modern press might have you believe) -- moreso the other way around. Read, read, read.  Augustine's Confessions from 400 A.D., Ignatius of Antioch from 100 A.D., Chesterton's Everlasting Man or C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity from the 20th Century.  Our flawed understanding of science has changed radically from the 19th century to today-- whereas Christian writings from the 2nd century are clearly recognizable in the Catholic Church's present teachings.  Go figure.You may be surprised (if you can get past the modern day ""enlightened"" blinders) where what we take for granted actually comes from.  Use this cinematic masterpiece for what it is -- the most realistic depiction to date of THE historical event that literally changed mankind for the better (regardless of whatever selfish scoundrels have done in whoever's name throughout history), not for what you'd like it to be.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ZZ93HABXDU36	Joe Mama	There have been many Movies that have depicted the last stages of Christ's life but none like this.  This movie was identicle to the bible, even every little detail.  With the great acting and an amazing set up for the  movie, this was the most touching movie that has ever been released.I went to see this movie in the theatre, and left a different person.  I never felt so into the movie, and felt like i should have helped or done something to help.  I have always been a huge believer and follower or his words, but while watching this movie i felt as if i was there with him, feeling his pain.While in the theatre i had never seen so many sad teary faces.  I could tell the whole theatre felt the pain i felt the whole time he was betrayed.  I will forever remember first watching this movie and as walking out of the theatre, hearing silence, and seeing so many grown people crying.	5.0	Most Touching Movie Ever	2004-10-11	6	5	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3QBKYANO0T7O0	joe man.	To start, let me say that from what I have read in the reviews, there is a lot of hostility and name calling. We are rating a movie here not the actual religion. So please stop the fighting.Although I'm not a Christian, I have great respect of Jesus Christ as a great prophet of God, messiah and a teacher. I love biblical stories, especially the stories of Moses and Jesus.  But this wasn't what I was looking for; the scenes with the Virgin Mary were perfectly done, and emotional. But the movie drags on with the physical torture of Jesus. Almost 99.9% of the film is comprised of torture and beating of Jesus, which I found genuinely distasteful.  What I would have liked to see is more about the teaching of Jesus, and why the Jews were so fixated on eliminating him from the scene.In conclusion, if your not a Christian then I don't see how you will relate to this movie, but if you believe in Jesus the messiah as a redeemer and his suffering led to the salvation of the human race, then this is totally the movie to buy.	2.0	FOR CHRISTIANS ONLY	2005-03-13	21	9	12

Jesus was played by the young and attractive heart throb, James Caviezel. Jesus was taunted ruthlessly. Jesus was beaten mercilessly. Jesus was whipped until every inch of his body bled. Jesus was kicked, spit on, and humiliated. Finally he was crucified.Needless to say my wife and went home and I had the best sex of our life after later that night after the flick.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it wasn't Monica Bellucci who did the whipping.	5.0	Great movie!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Mel Gibson""The Passion of the Christ"" focuses on the last hours of the life of Jesus of Nazareth (Jim Caviezel).  The film begins in the Garden of Getheseme where Jesus is betrayed by Judas for thirty pieces of silver.  It ends with the crucifixion at Calvary.  The bulk of the film is what happens in between Getheseme and Calvary and it focuses on Jesus' suffering.  This is what sets ""The Passion of the Christ"" apart from every other film made about the life of Jesus.  Many deal with the life of Christ, and others with his teaching.  ""The Passion of the Christ"" deals with one very short, and particular, period in his life: those last hours, the Passion.  The American Heritage Dictionary includes as one of the definitions of ""passion"" as ""The sufferings of Jesus in the period following the Last Supper and including the Crucifixion, as related in the New Testament"", and that is exactly what this film is about.  This is Mel Gibson showing us what Jesus went through and at times I could almost hear Gibson saying ""This.  He went through this for us.""While ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a very brutal movie, and perhaps half of the film features in some way the beating that Jesus took on the way to Calvary, it isn't the violence that has stuck with me after the movie ended.  What I found particularly memorable were some of the smaller moments: the flashbacks that showed Jesus with his mother (Maia Morgenstern), Jesus teaching, Jesus with the apostles.  Just as memorable, though, were the moments of betrayal: the look between Peter (Francesco De Vito) and Jesus after Peter denied Jesus for the third time, Mary (the mother) and Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) together weeping at the torture Jesus is suffering, and any time we saw Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) moving through the crowd, or tempting Jesus.  Lastly, Mel Gibson's handling of the Resurrection was particularly moving.  It is a mix between beautiful and simply powerful moments that allow this movie to rise far above what could otherwise be called (and has been) nothing more than two hours of Jesus being beaten.What makes reviewing this movie a challenge is that it is very difficult to separate the story from the filmmaking.  As a Christian, the story is one that is very familiar to me and is also one that I personally believe in.  As a reviewer, I have questions about Mel Gibson's storytelling.  If I knew nothing about Jesus of Nazareth and was not familiar with the story of Easter Week, would I understand what is happening in ""The Passion of the Christ""?  The film lets us know that this is a man named Jesus who is being persecuted, that it is the Jewish Pharisees of Jerusalem which have brought charges against Jesus to the Romans, and they feel that he is blaspheming God.  For this they wish Jesus to be put to death.  What the film does not go into is why.  Are these Jewish leaders just blood thirsty?  Are they threatened by Jesus' teaching?  Is there a serious law that he has, in fact, broken?  Why are they pushing so hard for his death?  ""The Passion of the Christ"" does not answer these questions.  Someone who does not know the story of Jesus may not know why he is being brutalized to this extent and what promises Jesus' life and death, and resurrection bring.Viewing the film from my perspective, the lack of that detail being in the film did not affect what I think of it.  ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a bold, moving, powerful film and the fact that the subject of the film is so central to what I believe only makes it more so.  I cannot speak to what a non-Christian would feel about ""The Passion of the Christ"" because an emotional response is so personal and subjective, and that emotional response is exactly what ""The Passion of the Christ"" taps in to.  The combination of how skillfully Mel Gibson has crafted his film (excepting that little issue with exposition) and the emotional response that it encourages, this is arguably one of the best films of the year so far and may very well be a contender for Best Picture come Oscar Season.The one criticism that I would like to address here is the charge, of some, of anti-Semitism.  It is one that I do not understand.  At the beginning of the film, when Satan is tempting Jesus, Satan mentions that carrying the full burden of sin is too much for one man.  The suggestion is that Jesus (and therefore God) is choosing to do this, and that Jesus knows what is coming.  In fact, Jesus says as much in the flashbacks throughout the movie.  Moreover, while it is true that it is the Jews who turn Jesus over to the Romans, there were some Jews who spoke up against their leadership saying this was wrong.  It was also only in the power of the Romans to condemn Jesus to be crucified and the film shows Pilate symbolically ""wash his hands"" of the whole affair, which was a cop-out.  Pilate made the decision.  It is also the Romans who are brutally whipping Jesus as punishment before he is to take up his cross.  The implication here is not that the Jews nor the Romans who are specifically guilty, but rather: All are guilty.  All.  With Gibson's hand being the one that drives the nail into Jesus, he includes himself in the ""all.""-Joe Sherry"	5.0	impossible to separate story from the filmmaking	2004-09-07	13	8	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3UQQ6WYJ4EDQ1	Joey D	Do not understand the charges of anti-semitism leveled against this film. In my lifetime I've seen this story filmed countless times. From the 1961 KING OF KINGS to George Steven's gargantuan THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD to THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW to JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to Zefferelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH and Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST all telling the same story with the same cast of characters. While some of them created controversy over political or creative thinking, others generated criticism over casting choices, none of them had charges of anti-semitism hurled at them. All the good guys are Jews, all the bad guys are either Roman, Jewish high priests or non-believers. What made Mel Gibson's film so different? And why did so many people jump on the bandwagon? Except for the violence, Gibson doesn't do anything the other films didn't already do. So what lies behind all this?	4.0	In defense of Mel Gibson	2012-06-18	1	0	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A10A4PJBRIFGLE	Joey M.	"Brutal?Many people have commented on the ""brutality"" of The Passion of the Christ, saying that it was ""too brutal"". Well Mel Gibson didn't just make up this story and decide to add a certain level of brutality to it, it really did happen.The Message: LOVEThe main message of the movie is that Jesus (The Son of God) came down to earth as a mere man, and being the ultimate sacrifice, died for our sins, so we could spend eternity with Him......if we so choose. I was raised as the son of a preacher, and I've heard of this message since I was small. Jesus died on a cross for our sins. But you tend to hear it so much that it loses it's meaning over time. Then you see a film like this, and you realize just how much He suffered. And for the people who balk at the brutality....God help you if Mel Gibson had made it the way it REALLY was. If he did, I guarantee this movie would not be shown.Crucifixtion 101Gibson's version is of to date the most accurate depiction so far, but still falls short of being totally truthful and accurate. For instance the Roman soldiers placed a hood over Jesus and punched and smacked Him so bad that He was disfigured. They tore the beard off of His face pulling chunks of flesh with it. He was so disfigured, that you couldn't even recognize Him. When He was hung on the cross He was hung naked, He didn't have a cloth around Him. This was a common practice for the Romans. The crucifying of people was meant more to shame them, as they were crucified in public. The actual crucifixtion was not meant to kill them. After a certain length of shame and ridicule, the Roman soldiers would break the legs (shins) so they could die. You see they supported themselves with their legs pushing up, so they could breathe. Once their legs were broken, they would die of asphyxiation, for a lack of oxygen. Jesus' legs were not broken, because the Roman soldier knew He was already dead, thereby fulfilling the Old Testament prophecy that none of His bones would be broken. Aside from these few brutalities left out, it is still a brutal film, and I highly recommend it to the believer and non-believer alike.The ""anti-semitic"" DebateAnd no, the film is NOT anti semitic. NO ONE (Jews, Romans)put Jesus to death. It was all part of God's perfect plan and will. Most people don't understand this. In the Old Testament the old covenant stated that in order for God to forgive you of your sins, you had to sacrifice a lamb that was white and perfect with no spot or blemish. Then God offered His only Son to be the ultimate sacrifice (referred in Scripture as the Lamb of God), so we didn't have to offer an animal sacrifice.Left Behind: It's RealThe Jewish people don't believe that Jesus came and died and rose again, that's why they are against the Christian faith. The Roman soldiers that guarded Jesus' tomb after He died were guarding it because the Jewish priests feared that Jesus' followers would come and steal the body away, claiming that he rose from the dead. These soldiers would die for leaving their post, yet they fled when the Angel came and uncovered the tomb and Jesus arose from the dead. The Roman soldiers were paid off, and the majority of Jews were deceived. That's why the early christians were deeply persecuted and killed. The Jews are still waiting for Him to come to the earth for the first time, but when He comes (which will be the second time) that's when He will come for those that believed in Him and rapture them away to spend eternity with Him in heaven. The Jews are God's chosen people, and one day they WILL understand. They have been the most oppressed people on history (even now with just about all the middle east against them) but their day of glory is coming.The ChoiceThe Christian faith is NOT about religion, but about a personal relationship with the One who gave His life for you, Jesus, God's only Son. If you want to spend eternity in heaven with Him, you must accept Him as your personal Lord and Saviour. In the Bible He says, ""I am the Way the Truth and the Life, no man (mankind) comes to the Father (God) but by Me"". God gave us a free will to choose eternity with Him or eternity in Hell, He does not send anyone to Hell. If you want to spend eternity with Him instead of eternity burning in Hell, then just say this simple prayer: ""Dear Lord Jesus, I confess that I am a sinner, and I believe that you died on the cross and rose again on the third day. Come into my heart and be my personal Lord and Saviour, Amen"" That's all there is to it. Read the Bible to understand and develop a closer relationship with Him."	5.0	Not Brutal Enough...	2004-08-29	35	20	15

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2WMBFIYGK5C45	Jo Flemming	I am not cold, nor am I without heart.  I cringe when I watch this movie.  I weep to think that this would happen to the most guilty of men let alone a good man who's done nothing to deserve it.  And though I am not a Christian I respect the story of Jesus.  But, this is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen portraying his life.99% of the story, the dialog, and the violence is not an accurate portrayal.  It's not just that most of the story is made up or isn't accurate according to the Bible, but most of the dialog is made up too.  Most of what is supposed to be from the Gospels is altered in some way to say something other that what scripture says.The violence in itself is another story.  Though it is told that Jesus was tortured and suffered, the violence depicted in the movie just isn't realistic.  It's not just that 99% of it isn't mentioned in the Bible, but there is no way on Earth that Jesus could have survived 20 minutes into the movie.  If he hadn't bled to death first, the fishhook type whips used on him would not only have ripped his flesh off his body, but gone in and ripped out his internal organs too.  It's just not realistic.  No one could have survived that.  Not even the Son of God.The portrayal of the Roman soldiers that beat Jesus wasn't realistic either.  I know that the Roman soldiers were cruel and could be sadistic but the way they are portrayed in this film is as much over the top as all the violence.  The Bible mentions nothing of all this punishment.  He wasn't beaten and whipped and kicked around the way they showed as he carried his cross to Calvary.  He fell three (3) times.  And most of the portrayal that went on with him being nailed to the cross and set up isn't mentioned at all.  Him being flipped over the way he was.  Geez!What this movie blatantly is, is an attempt to play on the emotions of those who believe so deeply in the story of Jesus.  Period.  It's false propaganda and it plays its part well.  You can tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they'd ever seen.  Don't buy into it.Any Christian who is interested in watching a more accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus would be far better off watching Jesus of Nazareth.  Or any non-Christian who's just interested in learning about Jesus' life.  The real purpose of Jesus' life is portrayed in Jesus of Nazareth, and done very well.  His teachings.  That is what is really important, not this excessively violent and unrealistic version.I'm giving this movie two stars because of the use of Aramaic and Latin, and because the cinematography was beautiful.  Oh, and because the rendition of Satan was really creepy.	2.0	Most Unrealistic Version of Jesus' Life I've Ever Seen	2007-09-06	17	7	10

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A193A7T1E8CUTB	John F. Frederick	"One of the most talked about films in decades; thought I would add my 2 cents as a late entry.I think the root controversy about the film has to do with the question of whether or not it has artistic merit for a viewer without faith. I think this is a fair question, as I never really understood the idea that religion offers, so to speak, an excuse for ugly artwork. Arguably there is no such excuse, unless one of the points of religious art is to repel people who don't already share the faith.The film has been labeled violent, which it is; but unfair here has been the label that it is in some noteworthy sense exceptionally violent. It is not. There are hundreds of films that are far more violent--and graphic. Perhaps this film is even less violent than average, at least of more recent decades. It is perhaps even less violent than the blockbuster version of Gandhi of some years back, billing Candice Bergen and Ben Kingsley, of which the Passion has reminded me somewhat; at any rate they are at least in the same ball park. Rather, the distinctive mark of the Passion is that it invites us to keep the humanity of the victim of violence in full view; not to distance ourselves by, say, feeling contempt or anger towards the victim as a bump-off-able bad guy, or seeing the victim as a replaceable curiosity, a dispensable nitwit. In the Gandhi movie, for example, the majority of the acts of violence are against victims who are more or less, cinematically speaking, dispensable nitwits. All we see Gandhi suffer is being shot at the end--and even that, at the beginning also, setting up a flashback--and a few blows to the head (from which he recovers).  In any event, it is easy to name films that are more violent, just not ones that, at the same time, are as personal.The character to suffer the violence in this film is not only the main character, it is a character who is anything but a dispensable nitwit. He is unambiguously portrayed as is in the Gospels--a perfect human being--and more: a Divine Person. No doubt faith is helpful here, but if the viewer can so much as entertain the premise as a possibility, then I would say that the movie is as beautiful as it is emotionally powerful. Yet even apart from that premise, the film also powerfully portrays deep love and friendships between human beings, which has surely a beauty of its own even under heart wrenching circumstances. Moreover, in what is surely one of, if not the most violent sequences in the film--the scourging (the soldiers carrying out the order, one in particular, wind up going over the top in enthusiasm)--we only see the victim about half the time; the rest of the time we see shots of peoples' faces, notably his friends, mostly of the face of his mother. The film does show us the anatomical side of the violence enough so that we really understand what is happening--but no more; the point is what it MEANS for it to be happening. In this film suffering is given a human face.It is quite a unique experience. First, breaking out of the package of being ""mere cinema,"" there are two points of honesty of the film even apart from any faith claim. (1) by all serious accounts, Jesus of Nazareth was at the least an exceptional human being; yet death by crucifixion was no walk in the park. (2) by all serious reflections, in one way or another--regardless of how you slice it (whether from the point of view of any religion or from the point of view of atheism)--humanity really hasn't treated God any better than the main character gets treated in this film. This is a film which portrays God as staying with humanity despite the way it has treated him (and the way human beings have treated each other). The violence is not for it own sake; still less is it for the sake either of sadism--or of a narrator stepping off the screen to address the audience with guilt trips (shaming and flagellating the viewer)--; it is for the sake of thoughtfully presenting this possibility in an artistic way. Second, rather that allowing the audience the space to distance themselves from characters undergoing violence, this film actually does the opposite: it prods the audience to see NONE of the characters as dispensable nitwits, not even those who are committing the violence. The anti-Semitism charge is simply a non-sequitur. It's not anti-anybody.The film visually portrays what I have described without being artificial or saccharine, invoking a remarkable depth for symbolism and a good sense of timing; it plainly succeeds in telling a story blending sight and sound. I will give two examples which I found especially powerful; they are even related. One is where the film shifts back and forth from shots of the feet of the roman soldiers standing in pools of his blood as they scourge him, to shots of the feet of the Apostles as he was symbolically washing them. The other is a subtle, nonverbal portrayal of the conversion of a roman soldier which spans in a sense the entire film. This conversion story is visually framed from the film's opening scenes when a servant of the High Priest (Malchus), accompanying the cohort sent to arrest Jesus, has his ear miraculously restored after it is sliced off in a struggle by one of the Apostles. Malchus remains for some time on his knees, as if so overcome by the experience he cannot move. The roman solider to be converted (referred to as Cassius) is subtly introduced in the next scenes (he is one of the soldiers Mary Magdalene complains to about the arrest), but we see him from time to time throughout the movie, witnessing and being influenced by various events; in a final scene, blood and water falls upon his eyes, flowing from the side of the deceased victim that he pierces with a lance (though first non-verbally apologizing to the mother; he does it merely to confirm he is dead), and he falls to his knees in a way which resonates with the action of Malchus.  Malchus, so to speak, had his hearing restored; the Cassius, so to speak, his sight. (While restoring Malchus' ear, Jesus says that he who lives by the sword, shall die by the sword; in response to Cassius' sword, Jesus, in death, gives life.)  On the side of deep friendships, notable are the relationships between Jesus, his mother, Mary Magdalene and the youngest Apostle, John. One moment uniting this dimension to the above examples is when John stumbles and falls on his knees before the two Marys (running to them to tell them of Jesus' arrest)--to be followed by John later seeing Mary's agony as she watches her son fall to his knees as he carries the cross. Another, also depicting the bond between Jesus and his mother, is when Jesus is actually underground (after his arrest), and Mary, intuiting the spot, kneels and puts her ear to the ground (with John and Magdalene watching and moved with understanding).  The kneeling image in general is itself also framed by beautiful opening and closing scenes invoking a folding together of earth and sky (the first providing the backdrop of Jesus falling to his knees in his agony in the garden; the second entailing powerful from-the-ground-up and from-the-sky-down shots of the moment of his death on the cross). Here resonating throughout is the film's awesome musical score. I would add that the use of Aramaic in the film punctuated with subtitles was nothing less than masterful; I am not even aware of the film being in a ""foreign language.""Acting was good but special mention needs to go to Maia Morgenstern, who played the mother. In interviews she said she played the character from the point of view of a mother who loved her son; the result is one of the most moving and beautiful character portrayals in all of cinema.If you are looking for popcorn-eating entertainment, this is not the film to watch. (Even during gladiatorial times at the Colosseum this movie would have gotten thumbs down.) But if you are in the mood for a thought-provoking treatment of religious themes in a serious, sensitive and artistic way, then by all means see the film.*Note: This review is not based on the Definitive Edition (or its commentary)."	5.0	'they've seized him'	2006-12-26	465	411	54

It's no Ten Commandments. How accurate I do not know. It happened 2000 years ago. A lot of revisionist history has been written since then. No real revelations. But with its disturbing violence it is an adult movie. The Jews are portrayed as blood-thirsty villans, especially the high priests. The Roman guards were sadistic caricatures who did the dirty work for the priests. Pilate comes off very well, as a compassionate, resonable Roman who hated his job. He tries to save Jesus several times. But the Jewish priests will have none of it.They are not satisfied that he has been scourged into a bloody mess, they want him crucified. No surprise ending. He has to die, of course. That event is the foundation of Christainity. You don't get an alternate ending.

I dont think that it's the greatest movie of the year, but it shure is the most interesting one. In some points I think that the movie was as cheesy and stupid as NBC's Passions but mostly it was fun. I didn't cry or anything and this movie didn't change my life and ""touched"" my soul at all.But I have to admit something... it kind of freaked me. That devil-thingy was really nasty looking, what was it anyway (male or female) and in that scene when it was holding that deformed baby thing was pretty nasty too and also the little demon children that were running after Judas (or is it Juda) anyway. the only question that I had was how could Mel Gibson take such a ""beautiful"" story and turn it to a ""horror movie""... Oh, well it works for me! The scenes in wich Jesus  was getting beatten up and crucified didn't really disturb me (mostly because I had a handful of Reese's peanut-butter cups and I just love them. When I eat Reese's P C  I go to ""Heaven""  and nothing can distract me.) Not even the people that were screaming and running out of the theaters with tears in their eyes. I was like ""What did I miss?"" Movies about religion always freak me out. I was traumatized for a year after seeing the ""Exorcist"" , but after the 10000 time of watching it I realized that  it had a deeper meaning that just all the screaming, puking and masturbating, it was a movie that had a touch of evil and a bigger ""touch"" of good. Kind of like this one .  But from all of the nasty, disgusting and traumatizing films that have a meaning of love and show us the power of the Lord, I have to say that the Exorcist was better. I am not religious i barely believe in the God that I am ""suppose"" to believe in (I'm a Christian-Orthodox. I'm Greek, He - He  unfortunately Greek's are cursed (they're dark and hairy like freakin' packy's) oh well... we cant have it all. Lets get back to the point.All the Jew's got pissed off with this film but they shouldn't of really cared.it's just a movie and nothing else, its not the actual Christ, its just an actor (and not a pretty good one if you ask me). No one really knows what exactly happened, so what makes people think that Mel knew? He just wanted money,and he got it (lucky bastard). Well Monica is in it so it's a good movie in my eyes! I am gonna' get the DVD tomorrow, I really don't know why (I didn't like the film that much and there aren't any special features in it (a special collectors edition is rumored to come out Christmas or Easter 2005) but I feel like something is pulling me towards it. well, you know what they say (if you have the money, buy it)!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A9U0X1KU1M88Z	John	What can you say about this powerful portrayal of the history of Christ's sacrifice on the cross made even more moving by the clarity of Blu-Ray?  I purchased it to show to a Spanish group at church, and this is made possible by the Spanish subtitles.  It will be shown through a EPSON projector with HDMI capabilities.  When testing it out it looked excellent.  The whole experience with the purchase through Amazon.com was very, very good.  The product arrived in a timely fashion.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AGUPQDBKN8CXQ	"John Hobbs ""Wendy Kuhn"""	I have never been to a movie where no one got up to get refreshments and no one talked during the movie.  At the end everyone including me just sat there for a few minutes before getting up to leave.  This film was so real and so moving that I cried steadily from the very first time Jesus was struck in the Garden of Gethsemane until he died on the cross.  To think he went through such torture for us.  I especially felt for Mary who had to watch her son suffer and die and I can understand why she wanted to die with him.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1PSAKYFFTS8F9	"John L. Hoh Jr. ""Author and Theologian"""	"On Saturday, March 6, 2004, I attended a showing of The Passion of the Christ with a group from Salem Evangelical Lutheran Church. We had decided to make this an evangelism event with a discussion following the movie followed by a chili fellowship. A group of 50 (half guests of Salem) attended the afternoon matinee. Flyers announcing the discussion were distributed and several viewers joined us for the discussion. All in all it was a good afternoon and all involved were able to sort out thoughts and feelings following the watching of this movie.In a word, the movie was breathtaking. Some scenes the audience literally jumps. The theater was quiet-one didn't hear the munching of popcorn!Artistically the movie portrayed the suffering as no one has seen it portrayed before. Many at the discussion admitted that it got to a point where they said to themselves, ""Enough already!"" One person even left the movie (but did re-join us for the discussion). My advice is to know yourself. If you feel you cannot handle violence or blood, don't go. If you do desire to see it, consider waiting until the movie is released on video or DVD and rent it-you can always stop the tape if the action becomes too intense.Mr. Gibson remained for the most part close to the Gospels. There are some Catholic add-ons, such as I believe Veronica wiping Jesus' face which is not found in the Gospels but is part of the chronology of the Stations of the Cross. Some thought Mary may have played too prominent a role, but she was the mother of Jesus; what mother wouldn't be there to comfort her child?Amazingly, I was able to understand about half the spoken dialogue (all that Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic training finally came in handy). The scenes with Pontius Pilate were interesting. Sometimes the dialogue between Pilate and the Jewish leaders was in Latin, other times in Aramaic/Hebrew. I will try to watch it again to try and detect a pattern. The subtitles were somewhat close to the Scriptures. Not knowing what translation of the English Scriptures Mr. Gibson used I cannot verify if the passages were verbatim. I did enjoy the opening scene of a black background with a verse from Isaiah in white text. It set the tone for the movie.There was, indeed, violence. How can there not be when a man is whipped and then crucified? Here the movie did disappoint. Having studied the Roman methods of torture and crucifixion I believe Mel Gibson held back in this area. And this might be the right call. The horrific violence that was on the screen was too much for some. Add to that the fact that the mental and emotional suffering Jesus endured weren't portrayed. (If you can stay awake through it, watch The Last Temptation of Christ and keep in mind throughout that this was a temptation as envisioned by the artist. This might give you a taste of what Jesus endured internally in this suffering.) The scene at the cross was a tad short. Mr. Gibson could have had Jesus pushing himself up gulping for breath just to give the audience a taste of the cruel discomfort on the cross. The arm being pulled did add realism to the effect just before the nail being driven through the right hand.The role of Pilate brings a new dimension for Christians who haven't thought too much about this man whom they name in their confessions. Mel Gibson adds a soliloquy by Pilate on truth where he asserts what he believes to be truth as he sees it. His wife, Claudia (not named in Scripture) does play a more prominent role than she does in Scripture. In the Gospels we are told she sends a messenger to her husband; in Passion she is right there through the trial giving her husband disapproving looks.You will not soon lose the picture of the gleeful Romans whipping Jesus. Again, in our discussion it was pointed out that the Roman culture loved blood.All in all, this is not a movie you will enjoy (even if the ticket taker says, ""Thank you. Enjoy the movie.""). But you will leave thinking about it and pondering it. You will want to talk to someone about it. If you do go to see it, try to go with a group planning to discuss it afterward, or schedule time for reflection afterward. One patron we met took a flyer disappointed she had to go to work. We assured her she could come anytime if she wanted to discuss the movie. Don't cheat yourself of this opportunity!"	5.0	Worth the effort to watch	2011-03-29	2	1	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1CA4IP0DCPF7W	John McAndrew	"This is a profoundly disturbing film. It is beautifully set and filmed, and very well acted. The  Aramaic dialogue lent authenticity and beauty to the scenes. I, personally, did not find the film to convey a message of anti-Semitism.So, why only two stars? Partly because I'm a stickler for a well-written script, and this film not only didn't have one, it hardly required one. But mostly because, though I am not a believer, I have respect for the story, and a desire to see it told well. Gibson's peculiar obsession with violence overwhelms it. Pelikan's Jesus Through the Centuries points out that, while we think of Jesus as being a challenge to dominant cultures, the portrayals of him are often a reflection and an endorsement of the dominant culture. So, in our extravagantly, pornographically violent times, Gibson produces a movie that extracts the most violent 24 hours of Jesus' life and makes it stand in place of the whole story. In an age of religiously-inspired violence, it is a tragic decision for a director to make.Gibson presumes that everyone knows Jesus and is sympathetic toward him. While that may be mostly true, it also lets Gibson off easy, absolving him of the director's difficult role in a tragedy: make the audience care for the characters, tell the audience why these characters are worthy. Instead, he involves us in an orgy of gore, reveling in the blood spilled, and raising the awkward question: If this is the whole purpose of Jesus' life, then what are we to think of the ""villains"", Judas and Pilate, et al, who brought about that which must be done?But Gibson as storyteller/evangelist is not interested in conundrums. I think he wants to make us feel good about feeling so bad. And he fails, at least in my case. I want to be ennobled by this story, as by stories of other selfless teachers who fell to the authorities of their times. I was appalled by the parents who had taken their children to see it. It is, hands down, one of the most graphically violent movies you will ever see, and parents should exercise the same caution with this film as they would with any other portrayal of a death by torture.I knew that it was violent, and graphic, when I went to see it. What I hoped for was that Gibson would try to convey a sense of solidarity between Jesus and others who have been murdered, tortured, or persecuted. That sense was entirely missing. If he had run the quotation - ""Whatsoever you do to the least of these, you do unto me"" - toward the end, all of the violence might have been somewhat redeemed by urging us to treat others with the same pathos Gibson wants to evoke in us for Christ. Instead, he gives the resurrection a bare moment at the end, accompanied by military marching music, as if Jesus came back to kick some serious [...] in retribution. I found the film, and its violence, utterly lacking in redemptive value. There is no grace here. I am not surprised that Gibson followed it up with yet another portrayal of human sacrifice, since that is what he reduced this grand story to: a mere barbaric bloodletting."	2.0	Good news . . . and bad news	2007-07-15	12	7	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A126JVOAOOR42V	John McConnell	"The Passion of the Christ is the story of Good Friday. The Gospel story is filled with understatements and ""Good Friday"" is one of them. It is also a name for a day which on the surface of it was the antithesis of anything good - the politically motivated murder of an innocent man through envy, ambition, connivance, and betrayal. But Good Friday is, as all Christians know, the day God Incarnate gave his human life to save humanity. So like the seventh day of Creation, ""it was very good"". The Passion of the Christ was the central, seminal, pivotal, event in Western Civilization.I personally have never been able to make it through an entire sitting of this film. It's too horrible, too deeply disturbing, to watch, for me. That said, I've made sure to watch it in sections from start to finish for it truly is a magnificent film, a film that needed to be made. It's a film that stands as a testament against the powers that be today similarly as its subject was a testament against the powers that be. Unlike so many films made today - for example the recent Noah, or the Lord of the Rings films by Peter Jackson - this is not a film that had to mangle its subject to make room for the director's ego. Rather, this film delivers as accurate a portrayal of the Passion of the Christ as this world will likely ever see in cinema. The stories surrounding the making of the film are fascinating in themselves.Why watch this incredibly disturbing film? It's sublime. Schopenhauer's definition of the sublime in Art, as I recall it being described, was of a force too great to be contained by the three-dimensional forms of time and space moving into the present, an aesthetic experience that is beyond moral judgments of right and wrong that touches the spiritual ""third rail"" of Creation. Similarly, James Joyce wrote of what he called ""aesthetic arrest"", an aesthetic experience in which one is neither drawn by desire nor repulsed by fear but simply locked into a profound meditative assessment of truth. These ideas are my best approach at answering the question of why to watch this film. There is something cosmic about this film. The miraculousness of the Passion narrative communicates itself through this film. So yes, hard as it is for me to bear watching it, I cannot imagine going through this life without seeing it, several times, for unless one is a mystic or saint this is the closest one will ever come in this lifetime to witnessing the Passion of the Christ.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A5I8OWSLWM1MF	John Michael Kain	"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie, as it is one of those movies that are well made, but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man, the son of God, is simply hard to see.As a movie, there isn't much to this. However, this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately, as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch, thus the ""R"" rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment, don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though, simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."	5.0	Well-made, yet unenjoyable	2005-04-17	12	9	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A332MW6OA1LYDF	John Noodles	"I may never stop laughing. I know it's impolite to laugh at cripples, but some of these whacked out Christianity-haters are too much!  It is obvious that they have a problem with Christianity and the attention it has received because of this movie, far more than with the movie itself.  One reviewer hysterically complained that the violence in this movie isn't ""fun.""  Well, he got THAT right, at least.  It is an extremely difficult movie to watch.  The violence is wrenching and unrelenting.I think that for viewers of faith, it will be very difficult to separate that faith from the experience this movie provides--which is exactly what the filmmaker intended.  Is this a great movie?  I don't know.  Is this a powerful experience?  Yes, definitely.  I have never been as alarmed or moved by any movie I have seen--and I've seen LOTS.To call the plot ""puny"" is more of a projection than an evaluation.  I mean, the Crucifixion is ONLY one of the greatest, most important stories EVER told--a fact that is independent of faith. What story has had as great an influence on so many people over the last 2 thousand years? (What? Lord of the Rings, you say?  BWAHAHAHAHA!)  And get real, this is a passion play, not a whodunit! Its ONLY intended purpose is to depict Christ's passion, which it does, with harrowing vividness.  And except for the meandering androgynous Satan, the movie sticks to the Gospel stories.Gibson elicits wonderful performances from his actors.  It's a slick production.  But it's not the kind of movie you walk out of saying, ""Wow, I REALLY loved that!""  It is to unsettling, too...incriminating.  You leave the theater chilled with a sense of your own culpability.  For that reason alone I don't know that I'll ever watch it again; I typically watch my favorite movies more than once, and regularly over the years.  This one, though, is painful to sit through."	5.0	Maladjusted Dimwits, Don't Bother...	2005-05-17	13	10	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AQ7V1UO19U1N9	John Rossi	I don't know what to say about this film that has not already been said. I will, however, try to give my two-cents-worth on it.The bottom line for me is this. This film is excellent. The performances are solid and emotional. The music is brooding, haunting, tense, and beautiful. The photography is the same for me. Often dark and gloomy and gritty but it works. It has a beauty all its own as well.Now let me use another g word. Gory. Be warned: This film is NOT meant as entertainment. It is like SCHINDLER'S LIST in the sense that it is unflinchingly brutal in it's depiction of a very emotional and true event.I was crying almost THROUGHOUT the film, at LEAST five times, but I lost count quickly. People asked me how old a child should be to see this. My answer was don't take children. If you REALLY want to, see it yourself and TALK with your child about it before going in. Be sure you know what a child can and cannot handle.Let me cut to the chase here. This film to me is NOT anti-Semitic. It did make me think though. It made me think how lucky I am that Jesus Christ really loves me and loves me enough that He would and has died for my sins and the sins of the world AND risen from the dead so that all who call on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord can be with Him in Heaven forever. As a Christian, this film was a graphic reminder to me of the incredible price that my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ paid to redeem me from sin and death, and when I thought of that, I felt extremely blessed, lucky, and LOVED. I lnow the Bible speaks of this, and I am not saying this film should replace the Living Word of God, but it was for me a reminder of all that I just mentioned here.In short, go and see this if you can. It is a film that will make you cringe, and likely weep with the brutality it depicts, but it will also likely touch your heart and move you in a way that few movies ever can. To me it is the most moving film of the past 11 years. I hope that you can go see it, and if you do, may you come away with a reminder of just how much the Lord Jesus Christ really loves you. Thanks for reading, and God bless you.	5.0	Brutal, brilliant and engaging. It made me think.	2004-02-29	1	1	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1P2NBM3P3TS2X	"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	Scholarly arguments about accuracy aside, this film gives an unflinching look at the last day or so of Jesus' life.  The depiction of his torturous lashings at the hands of the Roman soldiers goes beyond brutal. Even if you are well-acquainted with on-screen violence and have become a bit numbed to it, you will still probably react differently to this extended torture scene.  It is portrayed perhaps more viscerally here than in any other film I've seen or can think of right now.As to the controversy over whether this film will spark renewed anti-Semetic feelings, well that is another argument for another forum.  As a piece of moviemaking, however, TPOTC is as brutal as it needs to be to get its point across, as moving as it needs to be to be respectful of the subject matter, and as controversial as it needs to be to generate broad and across-the-board interest in seeing the film.This is not Gibson's first directorial effort, but it is his most accomplished and least technically flawed (narrative flow, not content necessarily).Not only is this film unsuitable for very young children (the violence may upset them -- this violence is realistic, as opposed to the cartoonish and overly-stylized violence they often see in video games or on television), but it will likely upset many adults too.  But a good (great?) movie SHOULD unnerve you a bit.This film is not made to be watched as much as EXPERIENCED.	5.0	Gut-wrenching	2004-03-08	8	7	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AHXR3QOX801UE	"John S. Lane ""beetle_sport"""	A little groundwork first, I was born in the early 50's and raised in a strict Roman Catholic household, I am a lapsed Catholic primarily because of Vatican II, like Mr. Gibson.I sat in awe for 2 hours watching this movie. No, watching is not quite the correct word, experiencing this movie, this spectacle. Everything I had been taught in parochial school came back with a vengeance. I had tears from almost the beginning, though the beginning was abit surreal and confusing. This is not a film to watch, it is a film to experience. The trials and eventual crucifixion were completely explored and clearly, though it was not spoken in this film, affixed the blame where it should. I would be surprised if this film did not reap every Oscar available. It was not so much what was spoken, but what you felt and knew already. Somewhere in the back of any Christian's mind this story came to life in ways that normally can only be imagined.Yes there is a violent factor in this film, but in my opinion it is overblown. Those were horrific times, brutal to the point of excess. I know now why the R rating and it is for one scene that cannot be ignored. When Jesus was being whipped and then the monster whip with the hooks hit and ...oh...what an effect. Jesus as a man endured at least what this movie shows and maybe a lot worse, we will never know. This movie is not about any faith or even right from wrong. This movie is not about any religion. This movie is about the suffering of one man who happened to be the son of god. Knowing full well that for mankind to be saved he must die, Jesus as a man suffered intolerable cruelty and ultimately his death. He had a responsibility to his fellow man and did not let us down. Maybe the point of this film is much simpler. Maybe it shows us that no matter how much we suffer or complain about the way things are, there is one man who took the worst the world could offer and in the end triumphed by as he said, 'it is accomplished'. If god can sacfrifice his own son to save mankind, then why cannot we 'suffer' a little and do some good for just one person? I still won't go back to the Catholic church, but I feel good and am not sure why.	5.0	Memories of my childhood	2004-09-01	9	8	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1EKA9XSI641C9	John S. Milas	Shiva Damienson has got it all wrong.  Every other movie about the New Testamont has been inacurate in their dipiction of Christ's crusifixtion.  If you've seen movies like Jesus of Nazereth and others from that era, than your eyes will be opened when you see this film.  If you consider the film to be overly violent than stay away from it, even if you are a Christian like me.  I am a Christian and was disturbed by the violence, but that was because it was commited against my savior: an inoccent man.  The movie is rated R for a reason, so this movie is not appropriate for a younger audience, but for anyone who has the stomach to handle it, than see it.	5.0	"The First ""Real"" Account"	2004-08-16	8	6	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AGH5RJDNL7TAZ	"John Stodder ""a.k.a. Juan La Princi"""	"I'm not a strongly religious person, and the experience of this film for someone who does not accept on faith the divinity of Christ is simply that one is being shown something truly awful and evil--the brutality of the Romans and the Jews of that time in punishing an innocent person who represented a political threat. The furious anger of the crowds against Jesus is bizarre and frightening, but never explained, so it is represented as pure blood lust.As a purely political movie, one might say this film shows that when the awful power of the state is combined with the enthusiasms of the mob, true evil will be done.All that said, this movie is a depiction, not a drama, and watching it, you are a witness, not an audience, and, as a witness, at times you feel very uncomfortable with the way the violence is being presented. There is an unmistakeable love for blood in this film, and it is an open question whether it reinforces or undermines the message.  The only interesting character is Pontius Pilate, who struggles with his conscience (embodied on screen by his wife), but ultimately ""washes his hands"" of Christ to appease the angry mob.Gibson is still a man of Hollywood, and the movie does have a brilliant Hollywood ending; a brief image of Christ healed and resurrected, but bearing one very visible mark of his torments.  This image embodies the new covenant represented by Christ.  But its power probably depends on how much faith you have in Christ's divinity.  If you are like me, thinking of Christ as a great teacher, but not ""God on earth"" the blood and suffering will seem over the top.  If you are not like me, and feel that Christ was God walking among us, then I imagine you'll embrace this movie as a necessary and instructive lesson."	3.0	A depiction, but not a drama	2004-10-27	10	4	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AQ79DO3H5GRS2	John Wykes	"A violent depiction of the last hours of Jesus Christ, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a monumentally daring move by director Mel Gibson, who used his own money to finance this decidedly non-Hollywood-type film.It is clear that Gibson has made a film that emerges from his own religious convictions, that Christ suffered and died to save all humankind from sin.  Thus, those who understand the theological message will not be so much offended by the violence as moved to greater spiritual awareness.  Those who do not understand the message or simply do not agree with it will see nothing but senseless, meaningless, unrelenting violence.It has been funny to see Hollywood scratching its head, wondering how such a film (in Aramaic and Latin, no less!)could become the 9th most popular film of all time.  They just don't get it.  They don't understand that there are many people, millions of people, who are starving for religious content in films.There is an audience out there that wishes to see films of a religious nature.  Mel Gibson has taken his own religious beliefs and committed them to film.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AI3QZLFQNTIZB	Joie Mayfield	"I've now seen this movie twice.In those two times, I've come to two conclusions:1. This movie is one of the most incredibly beautiful films ever made. Gibson and his cinematographer took some inspiration from Italian painter Cavaraggio. I've since looked this artist up, and his vision is played out faithfully in the film.2. This movie is one of the most horrifying things I've ever seen. When one watches T2, or Gladiator, they know it's fiction. However, religious and secular documents give us proof that this truly happened to this man.With those two conclusions, I love this film. I think about the film's opening scene in the Garden, and I'm in awe of it's beauty. Also, I think of Jesus on that cross crying out, ""My God, My God, why have you forsaken me,"" and I'm horrified that he bore the sins of the world...just becuase he loved us.I'm a Christian, so I'm not going to hide behind the fact I'm seeing this movie through that filter. However, I've seen a lot of movies with philosophies that I don't agree with, and I still find them to be amazing movies.One caution I would offer would be that I wouldn't take children under the age of 12 to see this film. It's very brutal, and could give children nightmares.About Anti-Semitism: Well, this has sparked a lot of debate. I'll be honest...there are times when I look at Caiphas in the film and feel anger. But, there are times when I look at President Bush and feel anger. I don't hate either. The film doesn't depict Jews being responsible. One could, I guess, say that some of the Sanhedrin force it, but that's like saying all of the Taliban acts as all Muslims. Besides, Jesus states in the film, ""No one takes my life from me, I give it up myself."""	5.0	Beautiful and Horrifying	2004-02-28	7	5	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A38VACRQKJR3BJ	"jolianana ""jolianana"""	This movie was too violent for me,it felt more like a snuff film than a religious experience. I didn't even actually watch most of it. That said, the violence isn't the only reason I didn't like this film; Mel Gibson completely abandoned the general rules of story telling with this one. The characters weren't developed, or even introduced in some cases, if I hadn't read about the movie and the role of the devil before going to see it, I wouldn't have had a clue about the sexually ambiguous character who popped up at odd moments,and unless you're a person who has heard the story over and over again in church every Easter, the motives of these characters were a mystery. And even to those people it might not be entirely clear, as Mr. Gibson has chosen the old version of the bible as his source material. I only knew what some of the more obscure references were because of recently taken renaissance art classes. There were historical inaccuracies, but what costume drama doesn't have these, so these didn't bother me too much. Don't bother trying to recall those dim memories of the stations of the cross either, Jesus falls so many times you would swear Mr. Gibson was showing us the same footage over and over again.Basically, the movie left me feeling sick to my stomach and wanting nothing to do with  Mr. Gibson's (who it turns out, really is a violent old dinosaur) Christianity. Maybe if it hadn't been so relentlessly brutal, maybe if there had been more than five minutes of Jesus' message, even the five seconds of the ressurection at the end seemed tacked on like an afterthought, than it would be more palatable.	1.0	2 hours of gore 5 minutes of Jesus loves you	2004-09-22	33	15	18

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1GKC1OIDE8U6G	"Jonathan E. Garner ""-Jonathan"""	"I've been debating on how I should approach this review, as it may: a) anger someone, or b) make people think things about me that are untrue. This is my disclaimer: Jesus Christ is my personal Lord and Savior, I believe in him with all of my heart and would love nothing more than to bring all those I come into contact with towards his love.That Being said...The recent movie ""The Passion of the Christ,"" as directed by Mel Gibson attempts to show the suffering Christ went through during the final 12 hours of his life. Gibson has claimed constantly that he lifted the entire story straight from the Bible (save perhaps some of the non-biblical dialogue, which is OK). However, this is hardly the case, and in the end the movie ends up being nothing but Mel's personal story of how he thinks things should have happened, and for any person educated on things such as the Bible, Crucifixion, basic Biology and a bit of history would find the movie wildly inaccurate, and not worth the price of admission-that is unless you are soul searching.Even if you are soul searching, I would sincerely hope that would want something a bit more accurate, and to not be mislead by the slew of `artist license' this production takes.I will start with the most obvious-The actor playing Jesus (while he does a wonderful job) looks more like some Hippie from the 60's than a 1st Century Jew.Let's face it people-Jesus did not look anything like that image we are all brought up with. He was Jewish, and likely had rather dark skin (remember-he was hidden in Egypt for the first years of his life, and would need to have a darker complexion to not raise suspicion [he was being hunted by King Herod]). He also, in all likelihood, did NOT have long hair. That's right, I said did not. Why do I say that? Simple-the New Testament says that a man with long hair in those times is a shame unto his family.Would one of Jesus' disciples have said that if Jesus had had long hair?Furthermore, Judas had to kiss Jesus to show the guards which one in the group was Jesus, meaning he had a look similar to all of his disciples, whom were all Jewish, and likely had short haircuts, dark skin and beards.Next up to the plate is Pontius Pilate.His part in the movie was FAR too sympathetic to the cause of Jesus. While I will admit, he may have been willing to acquit Jesus (as he left the decision to the Jews between Jesus and Barrabus), he was more concerned about his own positions of power than of some supreme moral choice that may save his soul.The film is not overtly Anti-Semetic, it just portrays Pontius Pilate as being way to kind.The scene in which Jesus is flogged with the cat-o-nine tails starts out decently enough. They beat him with canes something terrible, but not over the top. It's when the infamous cat-o-nine tails comes out that things go crazy.Blood-EVERYWHERE. I started thinking that Quentin Tarintino had directed this scene in the movie because a) anyone beaten that much would have passed out in real life and b) anyone with that many DEEP wounds (ribs were showing, people) would have bled to death in a very short time. The amount of blood on the ground would have made even the most hearty, healthy man pass out and likely die from blood loss.When I said ribs were showing, I don't mean you could almost make out a piece of bone-I mean there was an entire patch of skin/muscle tissue missing. His calves and legs where torn to pieces (how could ANYONE walk like that?), and the crown of thorns looked as if it might have gouged out his right eye (which was understandably swollen shut).The most blatant of all of the historical errs is probably the fact that King Herod is portrayed in the film. King Herod?? He died in 3BC!?! What the? Is this ""Passion of the Christ: In Time""? Was Michael J. Fox originally cast to play Jesus? Not only was Herod in the movie-he was a flamboyant younger man! C'mon Mel!Finally (of the stuff I can remember at the moment, and there is much debate about this) the nails were driven through his hands in the movie. My belief is that they were driven through his wrists, and here is why:Traditional Roman Crucifixion had the victim nailed through the wrist for 2 main reason-to help support the weight of the body (as suffocating is the way one generally died (which is why they went to break everyone's legs in the movie)-the tissue in the hands just isn't strong enough. AND-when a nail is driven through the wrist in the right place, it pinches a key nerve producing and extraordinary amount of pain (you know, that nerve that makes the funny-bone not so funny).In those days, the `palm' included all of the arm from the finger tips to the building the elbow (on the side of what we now call the palm).Also, driving nails through his actual hand would have broken bones-which goes against the prophecy (as far as I know).I think that's all I can think of for now.The end was the high point of the movie (and no, not because it was over) but because you actually see a resurrected Jesus, which was quite warming."	2.0	The Passion to Mislead	2004-09-13	25	14	11
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3S71WW0FEU9DR	Jonathan M. Davis	"I have been scanning the reviews and I think that most of the reviewers can be pretty easily segregated into two extreme stereotypes: the Christians who naively think that watching this movie will transform the worldview of every viewer into an instant convert--which as a fellow Christian I find to be rather insulting of common sense--and the other extreme of non-Christians who had no idea what to expect from this movie other than what they should never have expected in the first place: an entertaining Hollywood flick.Make no mistake about it, the love of Christ is a love that disturbs. This is a very distrubing, non-entertaining movie, which is exactly what it was supposed to be.I give the film four stars instead of five for two reasons.1) It was marketed to Christians (good) but it was marketed as a mainstream theater flick (bad) in hopes that the casual observers would convert. I do not blame Mel for this directly, nor the filmmaking company. This was the fault of naive churches that embarrassed themselves by buying out theaters and harrassed strangers at the theater entrances. Mel did market to these churches directly, so there is some indirect responsibility there. This point is minor compared to #2, ...2) The film itself is unfairly incomplete. Mel had every intent all along to ONLY show Jesus' crucifixion, and, generally speaking, it was fairly true to scripture, if artistically exaggerated at times. However, while any section of the Bible put to film very well would earn five stars, this is nonetheless a movie, one that deserves critical evaluation from a movie perspective. It was a movie direction decision--not a Bible-documented reality, but a DECISION by Mel Gibson--to refuse to portray some of the pre-crucifixion ministry of Jesus. Granted, there are a few flashbacks during this film that portray the character of Jesus in various key points of his ministry, but these flashbacks are few and far between, buried in an agonizing mush of blood-splattering gore. From a movie critic perspective, despite my love for Jesus, and despite my tearful, full appreciation for what He did for me, nonetheless I would demand that my Jesus be portrayed as more than just some guy who was killed ""like a rose trampled on the ground"". That is so important, yes, but a film about by saviour is incomplete without being a film that is also about my lord and my teacher.Most importantly, I would want a film about the passion of the Word who became flesh to absolutely include profound instances of Him declaring that he is I Am.I do think that the film was well-made for what it attempted to be--a very artistic painting from the mind of one artist that may or may not be fully appreciable by all Christians.Most certainly, this film should NOT be watched by anyone who has not been educated about who this man is or that he claimed to be God the Son who was dying for our sins, and why he was necessary, etc. Most uneducated non-Christians have proven themselves unable to bear watching this gore with enough curiosity to dig deeper and find out what it was all about. All they will see is a terrible murder.And I think it is a terrible act of naivety on the part of my brethren to have expected otherwise.On the other hand, this film certainly does make it easy to identify sheep from goats. Those who hate this film either don't know the background of Jesus or have no love for Him in their hearts."	4.0	It Is What It Is: The Blatant, In-Your-Face Story Of Jesus' Crucifixion	2005-08-09	10	8	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A229GOA71T7D4N	Jon E. Malander	"All movies about the life of Christ have certain difficulties and limitations. After all, the last verse of the Gospel of John says: ""And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written."" Mel Gibson's attempt at recreating the last hours of the Christ on film is one of the best so far. Yes, the physical sufferings of the Christ are not a pleasant matter, but they point on to a greater suffering which was Christ bearing our sins before a holy God and recieving in Himself the wrath of God against sin that we might be free to enter into eternal life.In the 1960's I viewed the film ""The Gospel according to St. Matthew"". by the Italian marxist Pasolini. This film had a real impact on my life and I think Mel Gibson's film is of a similar nature.

Not really violent, but it had a taste of old horror films like RoseMary's Baby and The Omen, in the scene of the Devil? with a devil's baby? and also scenes of children turning into devil's faces, that to me was the scariest part, Violence? not really nothing horrendous like most movies out today, no real violence in this. Movie done artistically, and apparently Gibson has a real belief, because of the ruining of the Jewish Temple at the end of the movie makes sure of that. Other than that, you are not sure whether Jesus is a criminal or truly the son of God. All in all not a bad movie. If I sit through it enthralled, then ok, its a 4 or 5 rating. In this case a 4 rating, because there may be some racist attitudes towards Jews slightly in this movie, but all in all good well done watchable movie.	4.0	watched this artistic rendering	2010-02-17	2	0	2

I did however want to see this movie just to go see what all the hype is about; after all I do not believe that you can have an opinion on a movie if you have not seen it yet. Now before I begin I would like to say the following, if you are a parent...PLEASE...PLEASE do not bring your kids no matter how religious you are. Yes the movie is amazing, yes it is a story that has a deeply religious theme however this is not the kind of movie that children should be watching. The Jesus character is beaten mercilessly, put through sheer hell at times the blood is literally dripping from the screen, not something I believe children should have to sit through. The movie also has some scary elements relating to Satan that are sure to make people jump out of their seats, again something I do not believe children should be subjected to. People seem to forget that this is still a MOVIE, it is Mel Gibson's version of the last hours of Jesus' life, it is not an autobiography simply one man's version.Getting that little sermon out of the way I have to say that I was intrigued for the entire time that the movie was playing, the movie itself is breathtaking it is shot beautifully and I truly have a newfound respect for Mel Gibson as an actor, the cinematography for this movie was beautiful. Everything from costumes to landscape is a sight to behold. I do not believe that it is possible to leave this movie and not feel moved, even though I am still not religious I will say this; if half of the movie is based on true events then Jesus Christ truly gave up more than any of us can ever imagine. I was absolutely stunned and in awe at this movie.A beautiful work of art that shouldn't be missed by anyone, however please make sure that young children are not subjected to the violence in this movie, simply wait a few years before letting them see it, I am sure you would do the same with any other violent movie.	5.0	Parents please don't take your kids....	2004-04-13	7	5	2

Since I hadn't experienced it by myself I refused to make an opinion out of something I didn't know unlike some others.Finally I saw the film and the word to describe it that comes to my mind is ""extraordinary"".I didn't find anti-Semitism, which is not only something against the philosophy of Christians like me, but also against the very message of the film. The film can be seen as a story of forgiveness, love, sacrifice and faith. Anyone who thinks or perceives the contrary about it, didn't get it. Gibson said this himself and after watching the film, I must agree.But taking the religious controversy aside, the film is both beautiful and brutal. The cinematography is dazzling, the acting is astonishing, the frames are powerful in all senses. The film is in simple terms, a work of cinematographic art.I only found two problems, but  I also understand their reasons.Firstly, there is too much violence and blood. Despite reality must have been like that (or even worst), Gibson took no compassion on the audience and pointed the camera right into the most difficult angle to watch emotionally speaking. His intention was clear, he wanted to ignite a storm of emotions on the viewer (and he succeeded), but personally I think it will take me some time to recover from that before I raise the courage of watching it again. Then again, this film is intended to be an artistic and personal experience, not an entertainment.Secondly, I felt Gibson left me in expectation. He used flashbacks to some of Jesus' teachings. Some of them, like the ""love your enemies, if you only loved the ones that love you, where would the merit be?"" were perfectly handled. But one in particular, the attempt to stone Magdalena, felt to me as if it should have been larger and more specific. I got the message, but I felt left in expectation. The other part, was Jesus' resurrection. A little time devoted to Jesus' contact with his apostles, or perhaps his conversation with Magdalena would have been welcomed. The film would have been around 10 minutes longer, but it would have been more powerful.But in the end, Gibson's intention was to show the last 12 hours, and in that he delivered in a extraordinary way. Kudos to Mel Gibson for devoting himself so deeply into this project and achieving what he did.Gibson made with 23 million dollars, what others would have needed more than 80 million to do.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AR2DE47VCY1C8	"Joseph H Pierre ""Joe Pierre"""	"This is my honest opinion of this film.  You may object, but it is, after all, my opinion and not necessarily yours.Obviously this film was not intended to be entertaining.  And it is not.  The filming, directing and acting are superlative.  I've never seen better.Although the film is based on the New Testament Gospels, which I have read off and on for three-quarters of a century, Mel Gibson took several liberties with the orthodox version of the events surrounding Yeshua's death, which is what the film was designed to portray honestly, as I understand it.I've sold Catholic Bibles, and am familiar with the protestant version as well.  I don't recall any justification for the raven plucking out one of the thieve's eyes on the cross, as it was portrayed in this film.  Also, the appearance of Satan with a reptile in the Garden of Gethsemani was a fictional addition.  It is my understanding, also, that it was Roman practice to drive spikes through the wrist, rather than the palms--although the Bible does mention the resurrected Christ offering Thomas to touch his hand wounds.  The nailed hands would not hold up the crucixion victim, but in this case his wrists were bound to the cross, which would seem to nullify that objection. and it was the custom for the crucifiction victims to carry only the crossbar, rather than an entire cross to the place of execution, as indeed the thieves were shown doing in the film.  Why was He singled out?  Maybe we'll never know the answers to some of these questions.When I was in my mid-twenties, in the best condition of my life, I think that I could not have carried a cross made of six-by-six timbers, of the size depicted, any distance.  I could barely have picked it up, and I was a strong young man.  The cross in the picture was carried by a man who had just been subjected to a scourging and whipping which had left him half dead, and judging by the amount of blood sopped up at the whipping scene by the women (Mary the mother of Yeshua (Jesus, in the Greek translation) and Mary Magdalene, he couldn't have had much blood left in his body, which brings up another problem:  there is no mention in the New Testament of the women doing any such thing...and, why should they have?In the movie, he was tried four times, once by Caiaphas, the High Priest of the Jerusalem temple, once by King Herod, King of Judeaee, and twice by Pontius Pilate, the Roman Procurator.  All in one night and day.  And Herod's palace was not even in Jerusalem, although he may have been there for Passover.  In three of the gospels, the trial by Herod is not mentioned; only the Gospel of John (the last of the canonical Gospels written) refers to it, and does say that he was in Jerusalem.First, he was beat up by the Jewish temple guards, who took him in Gethsemani with the help of Judas Iscariot (liberties were taken with his death scene, also), then Pilate had him flogged near to death (the beating alone, as depicted, would have killed any ordinary man halfway through it), and finally he dragged his cross all the way to Golgotha (with some help).The movie was filled with gratuitous brutality and cruelty not justified to the extent depicted by the accounts in the Christian canonical New Testament Gospels.  In fact, throughout those accounts, the impression is that he was calm and dignified throughout the entire tribulation, until the very last, when he was on the cross.  Even then, he seems to have maintained his composure, even through his pain.  A far cry from the Jesus depicted in this film, I think.Which brings me to my main concern about this movie:  No one can doubt that the Roman's method of capital punishment, crucifixion, was brutal.  It is also written in the canonical Gospels that he, Yeshua, was scourged (whipped, or flogged), which necessarily was also brutal.  But, even so, I, my wife, and the couple with us--although we were expecting to witness brutality--did not expect the horrendous, unspeakable brutality to which we were subjected, nor the heartless jeers and laughing of the Jerusalem crowds and the Romans who were inflicting the torture.  It seemed endless, and unspeakable, comprising most of the movie.  We were unanimous in our opinion that the movie was over the top in its depiction of cruelty.  If the intent was to make the viewers appreciate Christ's suffering for our sake, as they all say, I think it was overdone.  Most of us appreciate it already.This movie will probably win an academy award for filming, acting, directing, and a half-dozen other things.  I repeat: it is not entertainment, nor ia it particularly edifying.  Christians already know the story.  Non-Christians have no reason to see it, and will not appreciate the subtle allusions to certain biblical references.As for the accusations of anti-Semitism, I think any hint of it was overshadowed by the rampant anti-humanism.  The Romans were, by far, the most likeable characters, with the exception of His followers, although they were the ones who inflicted all of the brutality.  There were at least a few of them who showed some humanity.DO NOT take a child to see this film.  I was ready to leave before it was half over, because I had seen enough torture to last me a lifetime, and was not learning anything I didn't already know.I do not find this kind of film entertaining or edifying, and it is an experience that I can do without.  Real life is bad enough, without depicting fictional events that are even worse.Sorry, Mel.  Your heart was undoubtedly in the right place, and technically it was a masterpiece.  You deserve praise for the attempt.

This movie does have a few flashbacks about his life, looking back at things that happened before he was captured but it's mostly about a short period in his life when he was captured that Mel Gibson made around 120 minutes of movie from.The Movie title ""Passion of the Christ"" is a perfect title to the movie cause what happens to Jesus in this movie, is literally beatings from the first to the last movie. It's defenitely not for the faint hearted. I asked myself the question, was this real? Cause you don't hear so often that Jesus was beaten this much and seing the movie really makes you feel uncomfortable about it. But I believe that this is the truth, If we should look at the bible it is most certainly the truth. When you make a movie that is historical it must be based on on the truth and not like Pearl Harbour, Troy or whatever. What I would have changed was the scene when the Roman soldier were going to punsih him, it's really too much. We got the point without having to see them beating him for 15 minutes til there weren't much left of him. I also believe that the Devil potraited by this woman wasn't neccesary, I didn't see the point in her appearence.What I liked and why this movie will go down in history is that it's truthful and that it is original but also very controvercial, making a story about the life of Jesus surely is one brave thing from Mt Gibson. The movie is also filmed in the south Italy, which looks like Isreal a bit and the language they speak is Arameic and Latin not English. Passion of the Christ touches you deep and it will be remembered for a long time. James Caviezel plays Jesus and did that well, even if he speak very little he looks like Jesus. Well done Gibson, this movie was a good job."	5.0	Passion of the Christ	2005-02-27	2	2	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ATRQYPOKHRIR4	Joseph S. Fuentes	A befuddled reviewer who hastens to write a review of this movie&#8212;with eyes and ears still dazed from watching it&#8212;would be quick to conclude of its greatness. The result? Five stars. Talk of cinematic hypnotism. But if a reviewer is incisive and subtle enough to penetrate into the soul of the creator through the intricate disguises of the medium, then he could discuss it with much deeper understanding. You see, the film is full of hidden motives. Let us examine it.Throughout the entire movie, there is an effort or a recurring motif of presenting a constantly mellow, temperate, ever-suffering Christ. A usual criticism of the film is directed at its graphic violence. But this is better viewed in the light of our commentary. The spilling of voluminous amount of blood serves the purpose of our director&#8212;which is to present a far more acceptable image of Christ than which is presented in the Bible. Indeed, in watching the film, one would find it hard to believe that Christ, as portrayed by the soft-spoken Jim Caviezel, could be capable of drubbing his opponents in this manner (this is found in the Bible): &#8220;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Hell!&#8221; Compassion. This explains the movie&#8217;s appeal to our senses.But  Christianity is not only an &#8220;existential communication expressing an existential contradiction&#8221; (Kierkegaard). More than this, it is a metaphysical system of belief. In the length of the movie, the latter aspect of Christianity is never touched upon. Therefore, displaying its hideous side was cleverly avoided. But therein lies our objection. &#8220;Humility,&#8221; &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; are but foreground countenance of Christianity. Behind it lurks the terror of eternal punishment, the horror of damnation and divine retribution. Because Christianity is essentially a metaphysical doctrine of cruelty.There is a scene in the movie that holds the key to the secret of the innermost nature of our director, perhaps as much as of Christ Himself. This is when Jesus falls to the ground and Mary rushes to help Him&#8212;with the undying glimmer in His eyes, He exclaims unto her: &#8220;See, Mother, I make all things new!&#8221;Could it be that the entire movie is nothing but paltry pomposity, and what the director reveals of himself and illustrates, far from being an art, is nothing but&#8212;an actor&#8217;s vanity?	2.0	See, I make all things new!	2005-11-18	22	4	18
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2M8XFIIF9GPO5	"Joseph Suglia ""The Greatest Author in the World"""	"THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004)A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaMel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004) is a personal film. An exceedingly, excessively, earnestly personal film. ""Personal"" to the point of autobiography. It is not merely a personal reinterpretation of the Jesus myth, but a hand-wringingly serious APPROPRIATION of that myth for the sake of a deeply personal program.What that ""deeply personal program"" might be, is worth pondering. The film focuses exclusively on the condemnation, scourging, and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth; the rest of his life is bracketed out. We see snapshots of his past in the form of flashbacks. But these flashbacks seem forced. They appear to be designed to make the torture seem relevant, i.e. ""religiously"" meaningful.The film has an INDEPENDENT investment in brutality, in cruelty. One suspects that Gibson has a particular interest in cruelty for cruelty's sake---not for any ""transcendent"" purpose.It is not accidental that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST has horror-film elements: the attack on Judas at the hands of screeching daemon-children, the ubiquitous presence of an androgynous Satan, the demotion of someone-or-other to Hell, etc. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is, sensu stricto, a horror film.Throughout, Jesus's VOLUNTARY assumption of his torture and death is emphasized. One of the strongest images in the film has The Christ embrace his own crucifix as if it were a lover. It is repeatedly stressed in this work that Jesus loves his persecutors, loves his persecutions, and welcomes and affirms his own death.Of course, there is scriptural evidence to support Jesus's affirmation of his own mortality. ""How blest you are, when you suffer insults and persecution and every kind of calumny for my sake. Accept it with gladness and exultation, for you have a rich reward in heaven; in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you"" [Matthew 5:11-12]. Anyone who has read the Gospels and the Gnostic texts, such as THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS, knows that Jesus's persecutors were acting according to a divinely ordained, prestabilized plan -- a plan that Jesus had accepted in advance.The undeniable accent on self-imposed violence, however, exceeds any ""religious"" justification. There is a kind of bloodlust in this film, a joy in the systematic reduction of a human body to dead meat. Religiosity, in this context, is used as a mere pretext for sexualized violence.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a violently pornographic film. It portrays violence as something that is deeply gratifying. Predictably, the film's creator and promoter is self-deceptive, dishonest, about its sadomasochistic dimensions.(Postscriptum: How is it possible that THE DREAMERS received an NC-17 rating for a smattering of male nudity and this film did not? A ""religious"" subtext pacifies the MPAA, it seems...).Dr. Joseph Suglia"	2.0	A review by Dr. Joseph Suglia	2011-04-21	17	3	14
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1HFG7I983AMSN	Josh Bledsoe	"I am a Christian, but Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Read that sentence again. I wrote that it was MEL GIBSON'S The Passion, not THE GOSPEL'S The Passion. This is a movie, people! And judging this solely as a movie, it is very poor. There is absolutely no story. If you don't know who Christ is, then you have no reason whatsoever to care that he's being tortured. The people who are being moved by this film are the one's who already know the story. This is a very unimaginative exercise that just basically tortures Christ for two hours and calls itself a movie. Even as someone who knows the story, shouldn't Christ stories be about his life and ministry, rather than his death? I do not think that Christ wants us to dwell on his death, or to wallow in buckets of his blood and gore. Give me a break. Do we really need a movie to tell us that getting whipped and nailed to a cross is horrible?Don't get me wrong. It's not like I sat there and felt nothing. In fact, I felt very angry. Not at the people who were torturing Christ, but at the filmmakers who tortured me."	1.0	Is this how we honor Christ? By torturing him for two hours?	2004-09-02	44	21	23

This movie is overrated at best I give it one star just because it was directed by Mel Gibson if he wasnt the director I would have given the movie negative stars if i could. Another let down was it WAS NOT IN ENGLISH! I can see trying to be precise or make it feel more real but I do not go to the movies to read I would have rather read it in the Bible again and saved the money it costs to get into the theatre. South Park was so right when stan and kenny was mad they paid and went to get their money back I felt the same way. Shame on people who say Tarantino is too violent and make an exception for this movie.And no most people do not watch Tarantino movies for violence most people watch them because theyre actually good movies.

I cant believe what they did to Jesus. Well, there burning in hell right now. The part that was sick was when they were beating him with a chain whip covered in blades and it stuck in the side of his tomach and pull his flesh out the back. And it was sad when they beat him while they made him carry his cross. This movie is NOT for people who hate bloodshed.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A4Z72X5C24X2K	"Josh ""of Rohan"""	The Passion of the Christ- Beyond All Expectations!This is the most important, profound, inspiring and emotional film I have ever seen, and yes the best one too.There is so much more to this film than has been discussed. First of all the violence in the context of this film was a condemnation of cruelty. It is as it was, and (as bad as it is) , if anything the reality was more brutal than the depiction here. I did not experience the desensitizing of violence as some have described, I felt every blow. There is no pleasure taken in the cruelty on the part of the film. It is too much for kids that may not understand the context and message. (Certainly no one under age should ever see it, and then only some will understand it. It is rated R for a reason.Second the only prejudice in the film is (rightfully) against evil people and the one they serve. Yes, Satan is in the film. Before you say that artistic license was taken, I would assert that Satan being the father of evil is implicitly present where there is cruelty. By including Satan in the depiction, the film makes very bold and brave revelations on the nature of evil. There are profound truths revealed that no other film has addressed so directly and eloquently. Satan appears as a sadistic mocking force of evil that takes many forms but has a hideous similarity in every incarnation. You will notice in your own life that the most cruel people you encounter have that same presence. Another insight into the nature of evil that this film shows is that when a person does evil, Satan does not empower them or protect them, but instead takes as much pleasure in torturing them as he does in torturing the innocent. Those that say there is no message have not only missed all of this, but they have missed the messages of Jesus that are covered in the film.There is an amazing moment when I found myself thinking how shameful and tragic that God should give man the greatest gift and man destroys it, when suddenly the shot is from God's point of view and I am feeling the same as he is. The film is a true artistic triumph as well, with it's amazing cinematography, and in my experience the authentic language helped immerse me in the story. I am told that most people will need the subtitles. In fact I didn't really notice the subtitles and found the ancient languages easy to understand.I salute Director Mel Gibson, the team at Icon, and the brilliant cast:James Caviezel ...JesusMonica Bellucci ...MagdalenMaia Morgenstern ...MaryRosalinda Celentano ...Satan	5.0	The Passion of the Christ- Beyond All Expectations!	2004-02-26	14	11	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AA47O6E6Q574A	Joshua Ingham	From the stand point of cinematography this movie has some spectacular scenes. Also putting it all in dead languages is a nice touch. However the plot is quite bad. The movies is basically the brutal touchier of a man for hours on end. That is not entertainment it is a kind of punishment. One goes to a Hollywood Blockbuster to be entertained. To watch a fight or hear a joke, see special effects, watch a love story develops from hate to true love. While I could be argued that this movie does have a love story because of some peoples god love for all people. From a story stand point though it is predictable and uneventful even for one who has not read the bible. I know many people disagree with this and some may accuse me of religion bashing but this is how I feel and I do not want your pity or for you to pray just try to consider a view of this movie other then your own.	1.0	A Bad Movie	2005-06-30	29	13	16
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A34Y2NKL9QQREB	Joshua J. Darrimon	I watched this movie many months ago and have thought about its violence, its intent and the historical context which Mel Gibson felt he was making the film.  A truely horrific film on many levels and I wish never to see it again.The film began wonderfully and even engaged me as I watched Jesus make the decisions he knew would take him down the path to his ultimate crucifiction.  However as the film progressed the story, beyond its interpretive problems, grew into a movie of violence. I felt ill watching beating after beating and dramatic fall after dramatic fall.  The realism although technically commendable was beyond gruesome and beyond reasonability.  The story was far overshadowed by Mel Gibson's almost pornographic interest in the visciousness of the experience.To bring a movie goer into the character's pain and visceral anguish is good film making but the level to which Mel Gibson goes takes away so much of the story of the crucifiction.  The suffering of Christ should be felt and felt soberly, but not to the outrageous degree that he takes the movie goer.This film that should not be seen.  Read your bible and take it in with your minds eye, its a better choice.	1.0	Oddly Pornographic	2004-11-19	40	18	22
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3Q44JBPTVOSB2	Joshua Pfister	I wrote a long description of the film itself and the merits/faults within, however I am compelled to let people draw their own conclusions and choose for themselves whether or not this is an important film. With one caveat, it should be known that this is a brutal and savage film about the long torture and death of Christ and nothing more. Do not expect to learn much about the story of his life or anything prior to the very graphic end. There are a few very short flashbacks to demonstrate some foreshadowing of the events that unfold but they are few and far between. Was the motivation of such an unflinching and gruesome depiction of the torture and ultimate crucifixion to exploit for the benefit of Hollywood or to enlighten and make a reality of what you have likely read or been told? I didn't feel comfortable to make that call for myself, much less anyone else.Blu-ray production and transfer were up to par with any high quality release. No glaring faults in picture or sound quality. I wouldn't say that you will be awed with demo quality material. I also wouldn't say it makes much difference when it comes to watching this particular movie.	4.0	High quality Blu-ray. High production values. Difficult to watch.	2014-01-10	1	0	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2CZBGIJP8TZ1T	Joy	I am a very strong Christian and a very faithful Christian and know that Jesus loves me!!  It's not just a belief, it goes so much deeper than that, but a feeling and a knowing that Jesus loves me deep in my soul and that he is always with me and he will never forsake me!  I have been at some very low points in my life and I actually had a message sent to me from The Lord, a spiritual awakening, yes Jesus spoke to me and now I am such a stronger and better person and for eternity, I will walk with Jesus, The Heavenly Father and The Holy Spirit!  I love Jesus and when I even think about what he did for me, dying for me on the cross, words can't even say how bad I feel and I start to cry.I started to watch this film and I didn't even get to the part where Jesus is on the cross and I was just in so much pain from seeing my saviour getting hurt from all these people.  Even before the cross, Jesus was taking abuse and it was too painful for me to watch any more.  I do intend to watch the entire thing one day, maybe even with another Christian, or even a husband who would be a Christian.  I picture Jesus on the cross and I just feel so much pain and it's just so painful to watch my Savior being hurt.Jesus will be with me for eternity and I will be him for eternity and I will never turn my back on him again!  Whatever mistakes I made in my life which brought me to those low points, I now no longer make and I always ask myself this:  What would Jesus do?  I ask that question before making any kind of big or important decision in my life.  I pray every day for everyone and for all the people who don't have Jesus in their life, to be touched in some way by God and get a message because I want everyone to have eternal love, eternal peace, eternal joy and eternal happiness with Lord Jesus, The Heavenly Father and The Holy Spirit in heaven!!

Not so much a movie as it is an experience. I felt as if I had been through the ringer, emotionally by the end. And, after all, isn't that what great movies do? Make you feel. Honestly, I don't know what a non-Christian will take away from seeing this film. It simply SHOWS you in honest terms what the gospels were only able to TELL you.It grabs you from the very first scene and although there are flashbacks and means of escape from the mental and emotional strain of watching the events unfold in chronological order, this movie is as unrelenting in it's drive to tell the story as I believe Christ was in accomplishing his mission in the final hours of his life on earth.If you are familiar with the story and watch with an open mind, I think you will be as moved as the others were who saw it in the theater with me. Simply an amazing and moving work. I know many who see it from strictly a secular point of view won't &quot;get it&quot; but to those of the Christian faith, or anyone who enjoys a good, moving cinema experience, this DVD will certainly be a must-have. Believe it or not, it actually has a happy ending. Simply, a film you will not soon forget.	5.0	As good as ANYTHING hollywood has ever produced!	2004-08-01	17	13	4

The story was good, although, I did feel Gibson did exploit the religious congregation a bit, just to make a lot of money (unexpectedly?); which just means, he's a normal Catholic man - just kidding dude, I liked the film.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ATZXE3YBV8GU	J.P.	"A qualifier before I proceed: I'm not a fan of Gibson, as either an actor or director, and I'm a stickler when it comes to movies. The golden age of film, if there ever was one, is gone and my view is that most films today are embarassingly bad (on many levels). Many of Mel's films fall into this category. Therefore, I was reluctant to see this film and prepared for the worst. In the end, my decision to go was based on the dim view I have taken toward all the whiners who have protested this film.That said, I was stunned by this film's greatness--from the script (incorporating the Gospel text with the writings of two famous visionaries) to the directing, acting, cinematography, and music. This is a complete package of excellence.I will caution that it is quite bloody, but not nearly as gratuitously so as today's Hollywood films. This is the point: the violence is not of the cartoonish variety that turns up in, say, the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies and many other films of the last 20 years. What was done to Jesus was bloody--bloodier than anything we see in the film. Gibson's picture is drawn in broad, very bright (occasionally garish) strokes, I grant, but this is so his message will make an impression on the mind of modern man, blunted as it is by violence and sodden by sex. The violence in ""The Passion"" is as unromantic and historically accurate as it was in ""Master and Commander"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", both very sober, intelligently made films I also recommend.To summarise, ""The Passion"" is a work of art whose very ably conveyed theme is: the transformation of suffering through forgiveness and love, into hope. Those who stated that they didn't get the point of the movie must have been asleep to miss this, and to miss the fact that it was released in a season of repentance. Gibson has stated that this film is as much about an ongoing crucifixion, as it is about the historical one. All of us, he said, belong to the rabble that still inflicts suffering on Christ. For this reason (and others) it is hard to regard this as an anti-Semitic film. It is, on the contrary, an anti-sin, anti-violence and anti-hate movie.Just as the unlikely James Boswell somehow managed to write a masterpiece--the epitome of all biographies--so Mel has managed to film a masterpiece, and to present in a profound and unique way the essence of Christ's great mission. This film has set a  new standard for religous epics. I hope Hollywood will take note of the box office receipts and get the hint: people hunger for high-quality films.In closing, I would issue a challenge to certain critics of this film to behave honourably. Let them stop skulking around and making false charges. For example, critics have now taken to calling this film ""homoerotic"", since no one listened when they insisted it was anti-Semitic. The libel appeared in one newspaper and then was picked up by another. Another example: critics initially attacked the movie because it followed too literally the Gospel accounts, but today one liberal columnist attacked its artistic liberties, as if he cared either way. Can there be any doubt as to what is behind this posturing?""Ferocious pride is the real spirit of the Revolution. This pride has so established itself in the world that it has exiled reason. It has a horror of reason. It gags it. It hunts it. And if it can kill it, it kills it. Prove to it the divinity of Christianity, its intellectual and philosophical reality, its historical dimension, its moral and social dimension. It wants none of it. That is its 'reason,' and it is the strongest one. It has placed a blindfold of impenetrable sophisms on the face of European civilization. It cannot see the heavens or hear the thunder.""

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A33UOIP7UFFURZ	J. Preece	"I have never in my life had a movie-going experience like the one when I saw The Passion.  This movie is very simple: it very graphically portaits the last few hours of Christ's life.  It's not a documentary on His whole life or what He taught (although a few brief snippets pepper the film). It is a very powerful statement of the suffering of Roman torture.  I swear you can feel the pain Jesus' felt.Whether or not you're a Christian, if you have an open mind and want a good history lesson, you will enjoy this film.  It's not feel-good movie by any means, but it is extremely moving and if nothing else you'll really ""experience"" getting nailed to a cross.If you are a Christian, you will never look the same at the sacrafice Christ made for you.I highly recommend spending a little time reading the four gospel accounts of Christ's life before seeing this film, especially if you aren't familiar with His history.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	"So much has all ready been said about The Passion of the Christ, it is difficult to come to this review with an open mind.  Indeed, so much controversy has been stirred, it was difficult to watch the picture with an open mind - I knew so much of what to expect.  So, let's begin by addressing the Big Questions.Question #1, Is the film anti-Semitic?  I do not believe so.  It is true that the main villain in the movie is the high-priest Ciaphas.  Some critics have protested that we do not see enough of the reasons for what he does.  He was afraid of stirring up the people and he felt threatened by Jesus.  That said, it is important to realize having reasons for doing a bad thing, does not excuse doing the bad thing.  In this case, a supposed ""holy man,"" a hypocrite, is instrumental in having an innocent man tortured and killed.  The same can be said for Pontius Pilate - yeah, he was trying to keep the peace, but since when is that an excuse for psychotic murder?  Watching The Passion of the Christ, I was reminded of another movie - Schindler's List - in which an evil government used institutionalized torture and murder against the Jews.  True, the Romans were not trying to commit genocide and they did not kill the millions the Nazis did, but the Jews were still subjugated.  The Roman centurions are the real thugs of this movie.Question #2, Is the film violent?  Yes.  It is relentless in its depiction of Christ's torture.  The complaint against most Hollywood Biblical epics is that they are silly, corny, sentimental stories.  NOT THIS ONE.  As soon as the film begins, it is in your face all the way.  Another reviewer has claimed that the violence is ""pornographic"", as if this were a snuff film.  I have seen films with pointless violence - this is not one of them.  People have grown familiar with the story of the Passion and they want it to stay nice, comfortable, and safe.  IT IS NOT.  The thing is that I believe that this is an ACCURATE depiction of what was done to him.  Should we not see the senseless killing in Schindler's List?  The concept that many people cannot grasp is, in movies ABOUT pointless violence, the violence is not pointless.  The entire reason this movie exists is to show what Christ went through.This movie doesn't have an arc in the conventional sense.  It is a docudrama chronicling that last hours of Christ's life.  Jim Caviezel is a robust, manly Jesus.  We can see how he could lead a vast movement.  The film is heavy-handed in places - I was reminded of Jesus Christ Superstar when Herrod was portrayed as a demented drag-queen.Is the film powerful?  Yes, undoubtedly so.  You will be unable to get it out of your head afterwards.  Yet, for all the violence, it is incredibly life-affirming.  Jesus' message - that we all have to love each other - comes through.  When we don't...well, just watch the movie.This film is capable of stirring tremendous religious fervor, and perhaps that's what people are afraid of.  The final image of the film - I won't ""spoil"" it for you, but you should be able to guess - is incredibly uplifting.  It almost has the feel of a superhero moment - inspiring all of us to take up our crosses and continue to fight for good."	5.0	An open mind...	2004-02-25	2	1	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1SVBCB3IT8H20	J. Ruff	"I have read many of the reviews of this movie, most of which are very intense, just like the film itself. After reading and hearing about nothing but the gore and violence contained throughout the picture, I was very suprised after viewing it to see nothing more than I expected from reading the Bible. The beatings, flogging, etc. are very close to what are portrayed in the gospels. In fact, the Messiah was said to have his appearnce ""more marred than any man"", so I actually was expecting Jesus to look even more disfigured. So enough about the over the top violence. Read the gospels. It was really that bad.Now for the DVD. I hesitated to give this review ""5"" stars because of my dissapointment in the DVD release of this film. The opening menu gives you the options to 1. Play the film, 2. Audio options, and 3. Chapter selection. There are no special features whatsoever on this DVD. Would it have been too much trouble to put the famous ""Primetime"" interview on here (I know that this interview is already available as a DVD selection, which is amazing that people would pay around $15 for a copy of a 40 minute interview). I have also seen a ""making of"" special on television that would have been a nice addition. Apparently the need to make more money on many different DVD's that should be special features on here was more important than putting out the best product possible.Overall, I would give the movie itself 5 stars as the most realistic portrayal of the Jesus' suffering ever put on film. However, only 3 stars for the DVD due to lack of ANY special features."	5.0	Great movie, lacking DVD	2004-09-08	6	6	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AZ6J3LQ3WF623	"J. Schwab ""smtaub"""	"I am responding on a previous editorial written by user VLR of San Diego, CA I will cut and paste to ""refresh"" everyone! The following paragraph is not my review, it is only the review that I am commenting on!I know I'll burn in hell for criticising this movie, however I feel compelled to warn others...perhaps the devil made me do it. Despite the lofty topic involved, this movie is nothing more than a cinematographyly supurb slasher film. The portrayal in this film of the carnage of Christ is long and drawn out while other interesting and worthy events surrounding the life and death of Christ are not examined at all. The film is gory and tedious. Perhaps the holy rollers of the world will feel validated by this movie for whatever reason, though there are other film choices which portray the story of Christ in a more inspiring way.For anyone that is religious and was religious prior to this movie (or even 9/11) you know what happened with the life of Christ, you know what he suffered and endured in his last days of his life. For someone to write a review on this movie and comment on how ""horrific and blood shedding and gor-filled"" it was, you do not know beyond what you are willing to except then. That was his life at the end. They didn't serve him up crumpets and tea, what you see is what he lived. To deny that and try to glorify his life by making it less of what he really endured is denying Christ. Think of that next time you want to watch PBS version of how he walked down the streets with no sweat or tears or blood dripping from his face. I think for someone to really understand and be grateful for what you have today, you need to realize this is what Christ endured for you. So do not deny him that! Do you not know what ""The Passion"" is? It is the last days of Christ, it is not the life prior or his resurection, it is the ""carange"" (as you put it, that he suffered. If you want to be inspired by Christ and his life, read the bible, go to church, or turn on a religion channel, but do not judge what will or will not inspire people about Christ. It is the agony that he endured that opens alot of peoples eyes and allows them to see just what they have taken for granted their whole lives. Try to be inspired by that!"	5.0	OPEN YOUR EYES TO REALITY!!!	2004-08-31	10	6	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ARLKYF9JL3QKB	J. SHARP	"What the world needs now is one more opinion on Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", right?I am adding mine because some have asked for it. But, as has been noted hundreds of times over, the movie itself is only part of the experience that is ""The Passion."" At this point the publicity, the prevailing Church attitude toward movies and celebrity, the accusations of bigotry, the accuracy and theology of the film, and the personality of Mel Gibson are of one cloth with it. So this will be a longer than usual review. It's taken me six months to write it.MEL - As Seattle film critic William Arnold says, ""I've been reading a lot about how Gibson has a martyr complex. I think that's ridiculous. Gibson is less a would-be martyr than a provocateur. There's something in his nature that delights in being abrasive and politically incorrect...He loves to light up a cigarette in places where it's forbidden.""I agree. Mel loves to goad people then gauge their response.Is that what ""The Passion"" is about? I honestly don't think so. Mel seems to have put an earnest effort into realizing his conception of Christ on film.MARKETING - Of far greater concern to me was the rush of devout, well-meaning Christians to this movie's defense and its propogation - before it was even released. Gibson's passionate creation of this film was an overt mainstream validation that many orthodox Christians had been starving for. His Icon production company leapt on this fact and created an enormous grass-roots marketing campaign that was wildly inexpensive considering the saturation it achieved. With volunteers fanning out across the suburbs bearing posters and leaflets and churches eagerly buying billboards that had Mel's name next to the name of their church, it was probably the biggest publicity coup of the decade.ANTI-SEMITIC? - In my humble Gentile opinion? Not that I can see. Apart from the Romans, virtually every character in the story is a Jew. Besides the disciples, there are good and kind Jews depicted throughout. The Sanhedrin, the religious and civic governing elders, are even conflicted over whether to put Jesus to death, with several arguing against it. Their initiation of His crucifixion to eliminate a religious threat is not a Gibsonian invention, however. It is written in all the gospels. If this film reflects poorly on anyone, it's the Italians. The maddeningly sadistic scourging and crucifixion are their doing. Which brings me to the next point.SHOCKING - One alarming facet of the evangelical reverence of this movie is the prima facie acceptance of the blanching gore and violence that permeate the ""The Passion."" Most viewers have to shut their eyes at points throughout the film and a few have even left to be sick. Yet some parents (who would never allow their kids to hear a swear word or a discussion on married sex!) took their younger children to it because ""they need to see what Jesus went through."" This simply floors me. Yes, as a Christian I believe Christ's death and resurrection are the preeminent events in human history and the deciding factor in every human life. But Little Timmy is still wrapping his head around Sunday school stories about the sweet, smiling cartoon Jesus who coddles lambs in his coloring books being killed because Timmy stole his friend's Hot Wheel car and lied about breaking Mom's favorite vase. Although it is true, the concept alone is often confusing and worrisome to them as it is.Am I objecting to an honest and unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering on my behalf? If it evokes repentence, gratitude, and adoration, then not in the least. But if it lingers on it salaciously, then yes. I think that - by and large - this film accomplishes the positive results. But it sometimes veers into the gratuitous, too.I often compare ""The Passion"" to ""Saving Private Ryan."" That film and its chilling brutality were both an awe-stricken acknowledgement of the sacrifice of the veterans of World War II and a visceral repellant against war itself. It was shocking but vitally necessary. So it can be argued for ""The Passion of the Christ."" Jesus died a vicious death to rescue all of us. We should be reminded of that and be repelled from taking its cause - our sin - lightly.But young children should not watch either movie. Period. And I hope never to watch them (along with ""Schindler's List"") more than a few times in my life. Any more than that and I might become desensitized to them and thus their central purpose. And that would be unwise.ACCURACY - It gets much of the biblically supported material right. BTW, the dream of Pilate's wife IS in the Bible (Matt. 27:19). The merely interpretive parts are often astonishlingly moving, even if they didn't necessarily happen that way.How does it fare theologically? Depends on your theology. ""The Passion"" makes it clear that Christ died to save the world. The most gutwrenching scene for me was when Jesus stumbles under the cross and tells Mary, ""See, mother. I'm making everything new.""Those who complain that Gibson has minimized Jesus' message of ""peace, love, and understanding"" in favor of sin and death need to 1) See the movie again and 2) Read the Scriptures again. If Christ's was not the ultimate example of nonviolent conviction, I don't know what is. As the Son of God, He could have struck His executioners dead at any point along the way. But Jesus was not a first-century hippie, either. He spoke more of a literal hell and of complete obedience to God than anyone else in the New Testament. And, honestly, the last twelve hours of His life weren't very conducive to preaching on diversity.This is a decidedly Catholic film. For example, the Stations of the Cross (a sequence of passion events enumerated in the Catholic prayers of the same name) are dutifully enacted, even at risk of creating cinematic redundancy. Mary seems able to locate Jesus through solid rock floors by ""sensing"" Him. But the scenes and events based on the extrabiblical writings of mystics and on later traditions that are regarded as history by some Catholics are alternately distracting and disturbing.BUT IS IT A GOOD MOVIE? - There may be no objective way for me to watch this. I suppose the only way I can answer the question is by rephrasing: Was it a successful movie? Did it have it's intended effect on the audience?Yes. And then some."	4.0	A tough film to view objectively. Maybe that's okay.	2006-08-14	14	9	5

Once kids are of the age they can handle the graphic nature of the whips with the jagged metal pieces in them I recommend they see it.  It puts them on an entirely new level of understanding what was given up for us.  Mel Gibson has his detractors but this is a great piece of work as many of his other works such as 'The Patriot.'

I embrace the story of Christ and the power of his teachings. Though this film contains only a few scenes of his life and ministry, the depiction of torture and the crucifixion aptly conveys a message of love - that is, what Christ was willing to suffer for all mankind. The imagery of the devil was well-placed. And, to me at least, the story moved at a good pace - not too fast, not too slow. Moreover, James Caviezel's performance was outstanding. However, I was not moved emotionally (or, spiritually) the way I had anticipated. Perhaps it was the hype.

It is a violent movie and I don't think anyone knows for sure if Jesus' death was that violent... in fact I don't think anyone knows for sure if God even exists (that's why they call it faith right?) People who say they are 100% certain that God exists are always whack jobs. People who say they are 100% sure that God doesn't exist are just as whacky. But one thing is certain, this is a very entertaining film that is done well and really should be considered one of the best movies of all time.	5.0	Incredible Film	2008-03-11	6	2	4

This is not really a very religious movie, but rather describes the last 12 hours of Jesus before he was crucified.  The content of the movie is very strong though.  Throughout the whole movie, I was bothered by how many times Christ was punished...was just in about every other scene!  I think, that the director(s) abused a little of the punishment, but that's my opinion.  We didn't get to live those times to find out how it really was, but it was very hard, lots of punishment and suffering.It shows clearly all the suffering Jesus went through, and how he stayed strong the whole way.  Like another reviewer mentioned, the Satan character and deamons that haunt Judas were well done.Overall, the movie is very good, with lots of strong & violent scenes and sad moments as well.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AKLG2QVCUVP3X	Judi Hinson	"I've seen this movie several times, but just felt like watching it again last night before Easter.  It is truly a brilliant movie, difficult to watch at times perhaps, but artistically and creatively brilliant nonetheless.  Jim Caviezel is simply remarkable as an actor.  In much of the movie, all of his emotion, back story, intentions were revealed through his eyes, in fact one eye.  And it all came across with intense clarity.  To me, He is remarkable also as a Christian, allowing himself to endure intense physical agony for a piece of film about His Savior.  It was a true labor of love.  I thought he was perfect for the role, portraying a manly, kind, strong, humble, and gracious Jesus rather than a one dimensional characterization of this blandly perfect person.  This time as I watched the long journey of Jesus carrying the cross, I was struck by a few critically beautiful moments that I think Mel Gibson and/or Jim Caviezel captured perfectly:Through the agony and torture of what He was experiencing as He walked, evil literally surrounding Him, this quiet moment of Mary coming to Him, showing Him that she would be there for Him, it seemed to almost physically strengthen Him, bless Him.  He was on a mission and He knew what He was doing as God and yet He was still human enough to receive encouragement from his mother.  He says to her ""I make all things new!"" which in turn serves to strengthen her with her own suffering.  The same beautiful moment with Veronica who came to wipe his face and give him a glass of water.  Such intensely beautiful moments because we can see a tiny bit of goodness amidst the human capacity to hate and destroy.  After so many of His friends deserted Him, the growing connection between Simon, who helped carry His cross, and Jesus was also extremely touching.  Then there was the scene on the cross when the thief professed faith in Him, Jesus looked almost relieved, like in that moment, despite the pain He was enduring, He remembered why He was doing this and who it was for.  The love in his (Caviezle's) eyes was almost palpable.I am very familiar with this story and I am very moved by the extent that Jesus went to stand between me and God's wrath toward sin, especially MY sin.  Several times during the trial and torture and beating scenes, I would whisper ""I really don't know how you did that.""  I wanted to defend, to fight back, to shout, ""You don't understand!!"" but He withheld for the purpose of displaying true Love and providing a way for those very people to be forgiven and given new life.The movie is definitely an emotional experience, not one I would lightly choose to undergo.  I respect Mel Gibson's decision to focus only on the ""passion"" of the Christ, but I really wished we could have seen more about the resurrection and the excitement and joy of seeing Him alive again and the implications of that for us.  It is this miracle of new life and a new beginning, that is freely offered to us.  Jesus literally did/does make all things new!  The movie challenges me, reminds me, encourages me, as I move forward in my own life, fulfilling the purposes God has for me.  I am so glad they made this film."	5.0	Brilliant	2012-04-08	5	4	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2EMP366TTS6E1	Judith Miller	After hearing so many controversial things about this film, I knew that I had to see it and make my own judgment.Watching THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST was an incredible and very emotional experience. The film was well done and all of the actors gave outstanding performances. Yes, the story was brutal, but many of us were taught from childhood that the Way of the Cross was painful and traumatic. We were also taught that Jesus followed that path out of love for humanity. Jesus was portrayed as a human man who suffered an agonizing twelve hours before his death. The film seemed so real and the expressions on the faces of the various characters were fascinating to see.  It was truly painful to witness the mother of Jesus, as she watches her son going through the worst of agonies. This movie could also be a lesson about mob violence. The cinematography was excellent and I felt that I was right there in the middle of it all.  I will never forget this film and think that this is Mel Gibson's greatest professional achievement.	5.0	--Heart wrenching portrayal of The Passion of Jesus--	2004-04-07	2	1	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AOKDDB3K925HO	Judith Painter	"This depiction of Our Savior's Passion and Death is based on the Truth of the events that led up to His Death culminating in His Resurrection from the dead.As I was watching, what made His death so much more meaningful is that He had the Power to ""...lay His Life down and the Power to take it up again."".  That realization brought Jesus' words to a new understanding.  Yes, I've always believed that He had the Power for both laying down his life and taking it up again, but His words spoken ended with....""and no one takes it from Me.""Jesus retained His Victory over sin and death by that very Power to obey His Father's Will, willingly enduring Satanic, Sadistic tortures, but stayed alive until His Mission was accomplished.  I don't believe any human being could have survived to make it to that culminating crucifixion....except having the ""power to take it up again""...each time He fell beneath the crushing weight outwardly and inwardly, broken and abandoned by ""firstly"" His ""friend"" progressing to increased abandonment by His closest disciples combined with the Chief Priests and Elders of His Beloved People. Step by step He was moving closer to the final ""death blow,"" not to His legs, but to His Sacred Humanity: Abandonment by His Father....saying, ABBA! Why have you forsaken Me? The power to lay His Life down willingly came again with the same Trust in His Father as He affirmed in the garden, only now it was finished. Of His own free will He placed His spirit into His Father's Hands.Almost as a living symbol of why He was dying...it strikes me that the Good Thief, gave Jesus the ""single lost sheep"" for whom he would give His Life.  The movie showed Jesus exhibiting almost a new Joy that this man believed in Him and promised Him entry that very Day.Thank you for the credit given for the few interruptions.  It wasn't as noticeable since I had seen the movie once before, but I find it touching that you would care.  Thanks.Judith P."	5.0	True Story	2014-03-28	3	1	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1027BL79BSP5P	Judson 1	Yeah this review is long overdue, and by rating you can tell where I stand. Furthermore (in defense of those who appreciated the movie) when you attack the movie about it's accuracy, don't use another movie as a reference. How about you look the story up in the bible (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and then come back with discrepencies. Then maybe there can be a civilized reply.On the other hand, I think the movie itself was a great display of what happened. I'm not saying every detail is exactly as it was, (The invention of the chair???? i dunno about that) but I wouldn't be surprised if much was different of how it really took place. Great production and music, which is played perfectly in the movie (right time, proper lenght). The only thing is that the movie wasn't in English.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1VYD8OKS7VICD	"Juha Ylinen ""Heinijoki"""	I had read many reviews before I saw this film. Some of them were very critical and said that this movie sucks. There were also many people who had sure that this is one of the best Christian movies ever made. Every one has right to say his own opinion that's why I'm going to tell what I liked this movie.First, this is surely the most realistic film that tells Jesus's suffering. If you are not sadomasocist, you can feel how whiplashes and hits that Jesus has to take, makes you cry or feel bad. In my opinion, it's a good thing that modern people can feel how Jesus had to suffer. Crucifixion was the event that change the world. Jesus died a cruel and painful death because He paidour sins on the cross. There are many people who has realised the meaning of Jesus's crucifixion when they have seen this film.Second, James Caviezel is a real good actor. His facial impressions and the way of talk are perfectly suited on the role of Jesus. Other actors are only statistics comparing to him. Satan is also showed on this movie and the man who plays his partdoes it a wicked way.Third, I liked a lot the music of this film because its dramatic, touching and beatiful.The only thing why don't I give this film five stars is Jesus'sheavenly message too little showing. I mean His stories, mercy and miracle works. There are only little flashes from the past that shows you for exemple the Last Supper and Jesus washing his disciples feet. It would be wise to cut a little Jesus's torturing parts and add little bit Jesus's classical stories.Finally, If you are believer you shoud see this movie immediately because it maybe helps you realise how Jesus suffer to pay our sins. If you don't believe that Jesus died to save us for eternal desruction, you can also go to see this film. It'spossible that you wake up and begin to think these things fo other way.	4.0	The Ultimate Torturing of Jesus Christ	2004-04-30	13	7	6

Atheists, Christians, Jewish people alike- they loved it. As a person who isn't religious (but also not atheist), I had no preconceived reason to love or hate this movie. I went in with an open mind, hoping it would be as powerful as I had been told it was.It wasn't.The majority of this movie can be summed up in 2 sentences: Jesus bleeds (a lot.) His mother and Mary Magdeline follow him around, with apalled looks on their faces, crying. This may seem a harsh, blunt summary, but trust me, it isn't an exaggeration.I'm having a hard time figuring out why this movie converted so many people. I can't imagine how the violence in this movie would even seem significant to a person who didn't know the story behind the man being put to a slow death (the movie certainly doesn't tell this story.) And if the viewer did know the story of Jesus... why hadn't they been converted BEFORE seeing the movie? A man's lifetime of tolerance, unconditional love, and self-sacrifice isn't enough to convert a person to Christianity, but a couple of hours watching brutal torture can do the trick? If that's the case, these people are joining the church for the wrong reasons.  I've been told, ""well you have to read the Bible to get the full story.""  I don't think that this movie should be any exception to the general rule that if you have to read the book to fully understand the movie, then it's not a good movie.I gave this movie 2 stars, and they're both for the cast.

Instead it seemed to be much more like a religious movie one might view in a Bible study class that was put on the big screen.  The primary difference, of course, was the graphic and ""in your face"" violence of the movie.  The effect of it was to have the viewer literally feel as if they were there witnessing the execution of Jesus first hand.  The scenes of Mary with Jesus were gut wrenching, and one would have to be hard-hearted not to be moved to tears (whether Christian or not).Please, by all means DO NOT bring your children to this movie.  Perhaps a child that is 15 or 16 could attend, but even at that as a parent you should view the movie first and then decide.

The only controversial thing I can see Hollywood getting upset over is the fact that Mel Gibson, chose to give the story of Jesus' final 12 hours the respect they deserve by truthfully, Biblically, and accurately depicting the events leading up to the crucifixion.""The Passion of the Christ"" chronicles the final 12 hours of Jesus Christ, from the moment he was taken into custody all the way up to the crucifixion and resurrection.  In that time we, the audience, get to see realistically what Jesus went through according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.Many critics felt the film was overly gory and grotesque in the way the scourging and crucifixion was portrayed.  I beg to differ, the scourging was in line with the way Romans punished criminals, or in this case perceived criminals, and the crucifixion was portrayed very realistically.  To ask Mel Gibson to not show the agony and torture Jesus endured to save mankind, would be a disservice to Mel's beliefs and the beliefs of other Christians, and Jesus himself.  No director has ever shown this level of detail when depicting Christ's sacrifice for us, and that is a testament unto Mel Gibson for being so courageous.""The Passion of the Christ"" is a brilliantly directed film, and Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus was the most human portrayal of the Savior that I have ever witnessed.  Of course, the story was incredible and stayed faithful to the Biblical accounts in the Gospels.

It was one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen. Is it graphic? Yes. Very. Is it over-the-top? Yes. Is it inspirational? To some. Is it sad? Extremely.The violence in this movie was not mindless and without a purpose, such as every horror film ever made. The violence in this movie, and believe me, it was abundant, serves the purpose of showing what Jesus suffered for the human race. I myself am an Atheist, I have lost my faith. I didn't walk into this film expecting to strengthen the little faith I had left or to throw me back full force into Catholicism. I saw this just to see what a single man would go through to save the people who, 2,000-somewhat years after his death and rebirth, barely believe in him anymore. Nowadays, there is precious little faith and hope to hold onto. What with the president we have in the White House, screwing the country over to serve his fathers agenda, but thats besides the point. Jesus did all this, being brutally beaten an inch from death, carrying a huge cross after that, only to be crucified for the people who know don't even acknowledge his existence.This film is powerful on many different levels. Emotional, physical, psychological. Emotions ran high for me, personally. From the moment they began to beat him to the moment the crucifixion was over, I could not stop crying. An extremely touching moment was when Jesus, played incredibly by Jim Caviezel, falls while holding the cross and Mary, his mother for those that didn't know, sees him on the ground, helplessly weak and being spat upon by the crowd and remembers a time when he was younger and he hurt himself and she runs to help him. Only this time, she knows she can't save him or stop the crowd. When that swell of John Debney's orchestral and choral fury kicks in, the tears went streaming down my face and there was nothing I could do to stop them.The movie was an amazing emotional roller coaster. There are a lot of really tough guys where I live and they told me they all cried like babies watching a man being beaten like an animal and then stand up again, prepared to take it all over again to show that he was truly the Son of God.This movie gets five stars from me, for its power, its emotion, its sense of craft, its sense of love, the beautiful cinematography by Caleb Deschanel, the amazing score by John Debney, the top of their game performances of the cast, and the direction of Mel Gibson, who took a major chance on this and knew in his heart that the Passion of Christ was nothing pretty. It was shocking, it was graphic, it was bloody, and it packed an emotional punch.	5.0	"""The Passion"" Dehydrated Me..."	2004-07-02	5	3	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2I58MQ0EPWRRG	Justin Thomas	"This movie tends to push it a little far in terms of violence. I feel I have a strong stomach and at times was still like ""whoa"". I guess you could argue that the events the movie is about were indeed violent, so its justified. It all just seemed a little much and a little unnecessary.On a good note though, the realism of the movie is fantastic. There was practically nothing in the movie that wouldn't be mistaken for real. The make-up, special effects, and biblical accuracy of the dialogue should be applauded. It seems to be the most honest attempt to create an untainted or biased retelling of the events of Christ's end.The entire dialogue of the film is presented in text at the bottom of the screen, so unless you understand Hebrew (at least I think its Hebrew), be prepared to read everything. While this does add to the realism, it almost takes away from the viewing because you spend the entire story reading sub-titles and for me, my eyes were constantly shifting back and forth between screenplay and sub-titles. So while the language would have been pleasing at times like for instance, when Christ has been crucified and he's talking to God, but I found it to be another distraction from the story, much like the extremely graphic violence.Overall I think this is a film that should be seen. I probably couldn't see myself watching this again and again. It was a lot to take in and won't fade from memory anytime soon. In the end I would say this is a well-made movie, and accurate as far as I know, however the continuous violence gets old after a while and the sub-titles do as well. 4 Stars."	4.0	Intense and memorable.	2004-08-28	7	2	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3HVAHHHY9D7AC	just my 2 cents	What an impact this movie has had... Yes, it is true, the movie is very graphic and depicts in excrutiating and accurate detail the suffering Christ endured. He was crucified and the movie realistically portrays what that was -&gt;&gt; probably the worst possible way to die that man could ever dream up. This type of punishment/execution really and truly was carried out. Mel Gibson didn't just make it up for shock value.I believe that Mel Gibson's intention was to attempt to deliver a wake-up call to anyone ready to listen by putting the uncensored story out there: an in-your-face, no-holds-barred depiction to remind us of the sacrifice Christ made for all of mankind. I'm sure there are countless ways the last twelve hours of Christ's life could have been recounted. In my opinion, I think Mel Gibson was trying to make an impact simply by illustrating what ACTUALLY happened, even at the risk of possibly offending some people.I know that after I saw it I felt a strong need to reconnect with my faith and have done so. The movie also helps to put into perspective the &quot;crosses&quot; every-day people bear. If Christ could get through that hell-on-earth without complaint or question or submission, we should all try a little harder to deal with our daily struggles in a humble way.I truly don't mean to preach (because I am by no means qualified to do so), but I get tired of all the negative press. To each his own, but I think it is hard to ignore all the good the release of this movie has done (people coming back to God, others converting to Christianity, and even those who confessed to committing crimes after seeing it). What an act of worship and witnessing by Mel Gibson. Well done. I am so grateful he overcame so many obstacles to release this very important film as his personal tribute to Jesus Christ. You have to admire him for that...	5.0	This movie changed me...	2004-07-20	17	12	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2EERM752BMSQD	just some guy	"People have told me, ""Jesus went through so much pain in this movie,"" and they cried. But the point of the life of Jesus isn't how much torture he went through, and here is a simple fact: Watching anyone tortured for hours, be it either Jesus or a farmer or a slave who stole a loaf of bread, would make any normal person feel awful and cry. People have said, ""It's so sad when Mary, the mother of Jesus, watched him being tortured. I felt so bad for her."" Okay, but the point is, if we were watching ANY mother watch ANY person being tortured for two hours, we would be compelled to feel intense sympathy for them. So the movie misses the mark, as if Gibson is trying to say, ""Look. See the pain Jesus had to go through? How awful, huh?"" Well, sure, but that would be awful for anyone to go through. What if they made a movie in a very graphic way about someone being burned at the stake in the Middle Ages? Like the many witches that were killed. They could draw out the psychological and physical pain of someone being tied up at the stake, the crying, the tortured expressions, the flames licking at the feet, slow motion camera movements, the flesh bubbling up as the flames grow, the hair burning, the frantic movement of the body trying to writhe away from the heat and the flames. It's just silly, you could make a drawn out movie about anyone's death. There is nothing unique about an awful death. Jesus' death was awful, but so were many other deaths.

This movie warrants that for its artistry and acting alone.  The way words are conveyed through expressions and symbols that are more universal than the Christian religion itself makes one understand why Mel Gibson did not initially find it necessary to release this movie with subtitles.In the story of the last hours of Christ, we have a compelling story of betrayal, denial, greed, forgiveness, anger, envy, redemption and just about every single element that the Bible identifies as a fundamental flaw or attribute.  What we see onscreen is not some anti-Semetic screed.  Far from it.  Gibson has taken liberties only in the scourging scenes that are performed by the Romans and in two flashback scenes meant to illustrate the human bond between he and his mother Mary.  Both the Jews and Pilate are portrayed the way they are portrayed in the New Testament and herein lies the problem.  For the fundamental divide between Christians and Jews is the story of Jesus and the New Testament.  The New Testament is in and of itself anti-Semetic to many because of the way the death of Jesus has been used for hundreds of years to stereotype and persecute Jews.  There are complaints about historical inaccuracies, but this seems like nitpicking in a movie that is so obviously relying upon faith and the book of that faith.  You can't blame Jews for being sensitive to this issue, but the kneejerk negative reaction is both out of line and outdated for modern America.As for the film itself, Gibson has made an endurance test, but it all has a purpose.  Those who say the lessons of Jesus are not conveyed in this film must not have watched it.  For they are clearly and artfully conveyed through a series of well-placed flashbacks that tie in to the current situation being acted out on film.  The underlying theme of forgiveness is emphasized on multiple occasions, so the serious watcher will not come away with the impression that he or she should go out and kill some Jews.  At worst, they may come away with the condescending belief that they should openly forgive modern Jews for whatever ills their ancient ancestors inflicted upon Jesus.This is a movie about faith and reinforcing that faith by showing the suffering of Christ in his last hours-- the suffering that he apparently endured for all of man's sins. It is a very Catholic film in that sense because it really pushes the guilt-ridden side of Christian theology (i.e. Jesus died for us all so feel so terrible about it that you never forget it).  But whether you believe in Jesus Christ or the historical accuracy of the Bible is not the issue.  Whether you can accept this movie as an articulate portrayal of religious text is.  There are certainly better stories to be found in both the Old and New Testaments, but Gibson has made this one as good as it can be.  The film itself is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.  The acting is magnificent and the costumes and settings perfect.  The only problem with the movie is that the story is not particularly compelling to this non-churchgoer.  Yet to Gibson's credit, he makes it at least interesting and emotionally charged.  All of this is a credit to a great director who has assembled a very fine group and made a very fine film.If you doubt Gibson's intentions because you find him to be a religious nutjob, then I can only ask you to study a scene right at the end.  When Jesus finally succumbs and is dead in Mary's arms, she looks down at her son, understandably griefstricken.  You start to think that this is the part where Mel really sticks it to the ""Christ-killers"".  But no.  Mary looks up with an unforgettable look of resignation and sadness in her eyes.  It is not an angry look, but a look consistent with Christianity's most fundamental tenet-- forgiveness.  That is the image that lasts when the movie ends shortly thereafter, and as a result it is also the lesson that lasts."	4.0	well done and well intentioned	2004-08-20	15	12	3

Now, with a lot of money to spend, he takes a shot at one of the most sacred histories of mankind. He could not miss: he knew the movie would make profit at least in all the confusion and contradiction and hype it would generate. I'm only astonished that de did play Christ himself! A late sort of humbleness, maybe...This movie is bad. It's violent, bloody, for the sake of nothing, because the audience is not given a solid background about the facts before the Passion.

Moreover, Jesus was depicted more like the conventional iconography--caucasian male with a beard and long hair. How did a hard working carpenter look in 2000 yrs old Middle East? Certainly not like the one shown.However, this movie did one good thing for me: reminded me about the necessity to cultivate compassion for fellow human beings. On the other hand, for the simple-minded, literal believer, this movie will generate hate, vengeance, and totally undeserving surge of emotion.From that standpoint, I must say, this movie fell short as a visual art.Watch it, but please ""watch out"" about what you feel."	2.0	Unnecessarily violent, and was missing the whole point, that is LOVE	2011-08-06	10	3	7

I fear it is because it is straining to be something that it is not. And that something I am writing about is called the truth as we perceive it.Now I myself don't know what the real truth, especially when it comes to the evocative subject of religion but then also neither does Mel Gibson have the answer either and sometimes some people can take poetic licence in a realm it was never meant to go.I will confess to once being a great fan of Mel Gibson, now however his very name makes me want to hurl chunks, and all because he said to the world albeit in a very quiet voice, ""my father has never lied to me.""His father is known to be a Holocaust denier, and so I do not think for one moment that Mr Gibson Junior can even begin to make a film about the death of Jesus Christ that is naturally unbiased to all concerned.Unfortunately he has made the film but in making The Passion of Jesus Christ the Director in my opinion needed to be TOTALLY indifferent to Christianity/Judaism/Islam so that the interpretation, and the WORD interpretation is VERY important here, of those final hours could be neutral in the extreme.Mr Gibson however is an ardent Catholic so that throws being even remotely neutral right of the proverbial window!The Bible may be the truth for many people, and for that I that I have the greatest of respect but look how many ways that one book is interpreted all over the world?In a time when we need movies like this to bring us together in a multi-faith environment, The Passion of Jesus Christ only pushes us further a part and this is another reason why I fear this film.A great tragedy and even greater one if Mr Gibson attempts to make a sequel, which of course would be called The Resurrection of Jesus Christ wouldn't it?"	1.0	One man's truth is another man's lie	2005-02-08	38	7	31

From the news to billboards to newspaper and magazine articles. The movie definitely lived up to the hype.This Jesus movie outshines the 50 others you could fine and for great reason as well. All other Jesus movies just take you right through, while Passion of the Christ diligently takes the time to accurately and vividly portray Jesus' final hours on Earth. This film adds on the realism by having the actors speak in Aramaic NOT English.The movie begins with Jesus' prayer in the garden and ends at tomb on resurrection Sunday. I must warn that this movie is not for the faint at heart either. When I said that this film vividly portrays Jesus' final hours, I meant it. They make the beatings Jesus take in this film very brutal. Even his crucifixion is barbarously dramatic. But the realistic drama in it all is what makes this gem so powerful and moving. The brutality in it all really makes you realize just how greatly Christ suffered for each and every one of us, believers and non-believers. The beautiful and peaceful score for the Resurrection as well as the scene of it all puts tears in my eyes every time I see it which capitalizes on this overall amazing, awe-inspiring Jesus adaptation.Overall: I have made it a tradition to watch this movie only once every year on the eve of Easter. I feel that if I watch it more than once a year, I won't be as touched by it. It's that good of a film that it should only be watched once a year! At least to me it is. As I mentioned dozens of times, this movie is very ruthless in the way they portray Jesus' punishment. I wouldn't recommend this film to be viewed by kids under the age of 8. But if you want to watch a movie that describes the final hours of Jesus Christ to a T, pick Passion of the Christ over the rest you can find	5.0	Powerful and Touching Story of Jesus' Sacrifice For Us All	2014-04-19	4	4	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2EQL2BP6IYEGX	"Karen Joy Lewallen ""klewall9"""	"Yes, I have seen the movie, or documentary rather, of ""The Passion of the Christ,"" and it is a beautiful depiction of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Although it did not show all the pain Jesus went through just for US, the part where His beard was ripped off his face, as it says in Isaiah Chapter 50, Verse 6, this is a REMARKABLE film.  And it did not show the part where Jesus shows Himself and the holes in His hands where they pierced Him to His disciples.  Nevertheless, it is still an AWESOME film.  ""He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth"" [Isaiah 53:7].  Not only have I cried all throughout the film, but I could see others crying as well.  God came down to this sinful world in the form of man called Jesus Christ, to save all sinners of the world from death.  By doing so, He gave up His own life, and had the power to take it back again.  No man took His life but Himself, the risen Savior.  I have only seen it twice and I cannot wait until The Passion comes out on DVD and VHS so that I can buy them both!  Christ is well worth spending money for. :-)  Having accepted and received Jesus as my personal Savior at the age of 4, I now am 20; I was not disappointed about the film whatsoever.  I might be an Independent/Fundamental Baptist, but I give that film high praise.  Nothing was off from the Bible at all.  It is basically God's work through Mel Gibson to get as many (people) SAVED out there as He can.  This is, I think, one of the BEST ways Jesus Christ can be spread about internationally worldwide!  God Bless Mel Gibson for making this film and putting his own $25 million into it from the bottom of his heart!  And God Bless all those of you who see the film!  I recommend it to everyone out there, believers and non-believers; go see the film!  You will NOT regret it!  It's made for ANYONE and EVERYONE!!!  Don't wait any longer to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior because today is the day of Salvation! ""(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I (helped) succored thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."" [2 Corinthians 6:2] :-)  (...)And to get a free booklet on ""The Passion of the Christ"", call toll free at 1-800-789-7303.  It will only take like a week to arrive!!  It's only 66 pages and is a Biblical Guide to the Passion.  Very exciting and interesting!  Hey, it's FREE!  Why miss out on it?  It'll answer all your questions to the film.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3JJWHINQVAN5I	Karl Spence	"Some common complaints about Gibson's film and/or the gospel accounts:1. Violence: Some reviewers complained that the scourging was overdone, that there is nothing in the gospels to indicate its severity. Not so. Jesus' quick death on the cross indicates the scourging was severe enough to be fatal. A healthy man could stay up there for days before dying. Jesus lasted only a few hours or less. It's the scourging that killed him.Some critics complained that Gibson slighted the rest of Jesus' story: his message, his miracles, his mercies. Other gospel films have done a better job in those respects. But in depicting Calvary, they fall short. ""The Passion"" is to those other gospel films as ""Saving Private Ryan"" is to ""The Longest Day."" That latter film will give you a much better overall view of D-Day. But only ""Ryan"" will make you really scared to be anywhere near Omaha Beach. In the same way, other gospel films give a well-rounded picture of the gospels, but only Gibson's film has made me really weep for what Jesus went through.2. Anti-Semitism: Critics complain that the picture lets Pilate off too easy, and makes Caiaphas the instigator of the crucifixion. That's how it is in the gospels, of course, but why is that? Well, Pilate was a pagan. His gods fought and fornicated with each other, and with men, and beasts, all the time. Why should he care if some rube comes in from the sticks claiming to be the Son of God? Only Caiaphas would care about that. Only a devout Jew would take God seriously enough to put this man Jesus on trial. Only a devout Jew would rend his garments at what he took to be blasphemy, and then relentlessly seek the blasphemer's death. That's no criticism of the Jews. It's a compliment. God chose them for a reason, after all. Had they been mere pagans, they'd have just shrugged Jesus off, like the Athenians did Paul. Without the Jews there'd be no Torah, no Psalms, no prophets, no gospels, no Good Friday, no Easter Sunday --- no salvation. Then where would we be?Where Caiaphas failed as a person was in being self-satisfied, too sure of his own virtue to accept that the rebukes cast his way by this Galilean upstart were justified, too wrapped up in himself to see the divinity in Jesus' words, deeds, body, soul and life. Being blind to God --- isn't that the story of us all, until we are saved?In any case, Jesus said, ""Forgive them, father, for they know not what they do."" They thought they were giving a blasphemer his just deserts (if they were Jewish), or swatting a seditious troublemaker (if they were Roman). Of everyone involved (other than those in Jesus' own circle), only Pilate's wife seems to have had a clue.I think Christians may come away from this film with a new sense of gratitude for Christ's sacrifice. Others, I pray, will find some good in it, and be moved to ""read the book."""	5.0	Think about it	2004-03-09	18	13	5

The guy next to my boyfriend wept like a repenting sinner, people cleared their noses and throats. They clasped their mouths.The brutal portrayal of Jesus's last 12 hours were gory, unhuman, bloody, tragic, and filled me with sorrow and love for him.It was an amazing movie, and the cast was perfect for it. A must see for anyone appreciating the deep topics.I think in a funny way, this hollywood production made me feel closer to God, it did not make me think any less of Jewish people, and it made me cry deeply when I got home, to let those emotions that I bottled up during the showtime, free.Go see it, I think everyone should.	5.0	Amazing	2004-02-25	1	1	0

He ascended into heaven and is not dead- that's the point!There was so much in the movie- theologically, theatrically and morally- that I plan to see it again!	5.0	Good movie.

The last riveting hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth starting from his prayer in the Garden to his arrest, trial, cruxifiction, death, and resurrection. A stunning, intense, vibrant, and the most true to life depiction of the the centrepiece of Christianity - the cross - and its vast impressions on theology. Mel Gibson, a very conservative Catholic, captures the Jewish origins of the founder of Christianity ... complete with cinematic images of the desert. Whether you believe in the religious story of this film or not the message of sacrifice and a passionate ectasy for God's will is, at the very least, awe inspiring.	5.0	The Passion of Sacrificial Love	2007-03-16	10	7	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1UE54EMPR6X2Z	"Kathryn A. Anderton ""Sophia"""	Finally, after nine years, I decided to watch this movie. Granted, it was free for the viewing on You Tube but I'm broke so sue me. I kept away from this movie for a number of reasons among them being a possible outbreak of anti-Semitism.First, this was a horrifying movie. It was difficult to deal with on a mental and visceral level. To overuse an unpleasant turn of phrase: it was awash in gore. (To the credit of the NT authors none of them go into the kind of gory detail that Mel Gibson does) That said, the horror is faithful to the reality of the sufferings of Jesus Christ. Anyone who has read descriptions of the horrific wounds on the Man of the Turin Shroud (whether it's Jesus or not) knows the movie is a faithful depiction. I'm glad I did not have to be there to witness and deal with the real thing.Kudos to Mel for avoiding English in favor of Aramaic (Hebrew was the language of the scholars not the common man) and Latin. I listened closely for Greek but did not discern any. Throwing in some Greek would have been historically correct as well because all three languages were current in that part of the world. Employing the real languages spoken, and meticulously researching the correct pronunciation of those tongues is a big plus in my ledger.The very sparse use of Jewish actors (if any at all were used) is a minus. However, given the Christian track record for killing Jews (it used to be a quaint Christian custom to rush out of Church on Easter morning to visit mayhem and even murder on the hapless local Jewish population) I understand and agree with the use of Gentiles rather than Jews.I did like the scene in Gethsemane where Kephas (Peter) goes ape**** on the soldiers sent to arrest Jesus. Nothing beats a berserker as the Vikings would one day show the world. I loved the inclusion of the scene in which Jesus reattached the ear of astonished Malchus.I did notice in the scene where the crowd was shouting for Jesus to be crucified that Mel did not translate the roar of the crowd &#34;His blood be upon us and upon our children!&#34; Even a rabid anti-Semite like Mel has his moments of clarity and for that we do indeed give thanks. Crowds were worked up enough over this film without giving them seeming Divine Sanction to go out and roll some Jews. I also noticed that several times Mel drove home the point that in both Latin and Aramaic the word for Jew is, roughly and approximately, Judas.Filming the Gospel accounts of the sufferings along the Via Dolorosa, Jesus was depicted as carrying his own cross (with crux), and then a man from the crowd was forced to carry another crux. Was he one of the malefactors with whom Jesus was crucified? Or Simon of Cyrene? This was puzzling especially when another man (Simon of Cyrene?) was forced to help Jesus carry his Cross all the way to Golgotha. The man carrying the other crux did not reappear unless he was one of the malefactors crucified with Christ. Confusing.Hey! Mel even worked in the Roman Catholic legend of the cloth of Veronica (One of the few actual Jewish actors, I think) upon which Jesus supposedly wiped his bloody face and left an imprint of his bloody visage. Mel, being a western Christian of the Roman variety, could not resist indulging in a little anthropomorphizing. In the scene where Jesus dies we are looking down from a great height. The scene is blurry, as if one is looking at the scene through water. Not surprisingly, one is. A single drop of water (a tear from God's eye...you understand when you see the movie) falls to the ground and an earthquake ensues. Rather than merely the veil of the temple being torn in two the temple itself is torn in two by the earthquake. Hollywood always has to be inaccurate. They would dry up and blow away if they had to stick to the facts. Hmm. Maybe we could pass a law...  ;-)Did I enjoy the movie? Ask me if I would enjoy witnessing the actual scourging and sufferings of Jesus. The answer is NO! NO other movie has gone so far beyond the NT into the gory reality as this movie has. I have a strong stomach and the sight and smell of blood, even of rotten flesh, does not faze me as it does others. I was somewhat fazed by this movie. I think it is as close to the ugly reality as we can get. :-()Oh, a final historical note. Mel really twisted the heel of his shoe in by making sure that Caiaphas, several times, used the Aramaic word for Caesar: Kaiser. Jah, der same pronunciation as der Deutsche! Kaiser! Did Mel include it to remind the viewer that one day the Germans would murder six million Jews under the leadership of Adolph Hitler (who himself was an avid student of Martin Luther who was a rabid anti-Semite and preached the extermination of the Jews) who used the &#34;Christ killer&#34; epithet to truly horrifying effect? Only Mel and his hairdresser know for sure.  :-DOne thumb up and one thumb down for Mels' morbid movie. :-/	3.0	PASSION, BLOODY PASSION	2013-10-16	1	0	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AFL3KGSIIF845	Kathy Michael	As a Bible student and teacher, I appreciated the faithfulness to the Scriptures. It was a bloody movie but these were bloody and violent times and a most bloody event. This type of Roman execution was meant to be torturous and humiliating to what the colonists considered the lowest of the low.As an artist the artistic quality of the film was superb but it was the story itself that was most important and beyond all accuracies or inaccuracies of the colors/races of the people, the placement of the nails, etc. the point was made and re-emphasized to all who know, that Christ was not killed by any single group but that He lay down His life for mankind and even in His humanity bravely took on that burden for the world. This movie is about the ultimate love sacrifice and though bloody it is in no way about hate. Although the feature is Christ's last 12 hours the flashbacks give background from the Scripture as to why He came, what He was about, what He taught and what He had to do.The actors learned the ancient Aramaic language (and Latin in the case of the Roman soldiers)which added to the atmosphere and did not in the least detract from the acting. On hearing of this, I originally thought this would be a mistake but it was an asset to the realism of the film. I would recommend this picture to churches and students of the Bible. I would suggest that new believers read and study these passages first as some parts of the movie takes for granted that the viewer understands and knows what was going on. Some parts may move along too quickly for those particular viewers who may need more familiarization of the times, ancient customs, traditions, etc.I was hoping, and I as not disappointed that the death was not the end.	5.0	"The Passion of the Christ Reviewed by ""Ms. Kathy"""	2004-02-28	3	3	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3CF7B2U0IB8PS	Katie	"First off, I am a proud conservative Roman Catholic who has been in Catholic school for almost 14 years.  I admire Mel Gibson as a person, particularly for sticking to his religious beliefs so well in the secular Hollywood.  But, no matter how much I like and respect the man, I cannot possibly bring myself to like this movie.I had to see this movie for my Confirmation class, so a friend and I went together.  As I said, I have been in Catholic school all of my life.  I have studied the medical process of Crucifixion in-depth.  Due to movies, and plays, and Stations of the Cross, I have seen Jesus brutally killed over one hundred different times.  I basically could stage my own Jesus crucifixion if I really wanted, I know what happens so well.  So I will admit I was only anxious to see the movie for the controversial supposed anti-Semitic undertone (I was wondering if it was true; I found none personally)... and Aramaic, which is a sweet language.How do I put this nicely.  Even when Jesus is being arrested, the unnecessary, non-scriptured violence already is beginning. They push him off of a cliff and he just dangles there!  I almost burst out laughing, it was so ridiculous.  Then there's the symbolism.  Oh my heavens, the symbolism.  It was like The Great Gatsby, the movie, only without the awesome characters, story, and the symbolism was incredibly forced.  Some of it was just gross too.  I'll get more into that later.Let's not forget the whipping scene... I sat through some of it, went to the bathroom, and then came back and they hadn't even finished with the first weapon!  I am pretty sure that the scripture clearly states that Jesus was whipped 39 times, but, whatever.  I wish that it had been done in like Jesus Christ Superstar with the guitar riff, so at least I could have enjoyed good music.  By the way, The Passion's music sucks.  It's similar to Troy, tries so hard to be disturbing and anguished but just ends up being a grating caterwhaul.There are some very beautiful scenes in the movie, don't get me wrong, ones that almost made me cry.  These are the non-violent ones, where we flash back to Jesus' life and teachings and stuff that doesn't involve him being covered with blood.  But they are too short-lived.  For example, I've always found one of the most beautiful parts of the Crucifixion to be the part with the good thief.  In the movie, it promises to have that same beauty, and I was awestruck for a moment... then the movie remembered ""Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be grossing people out"" and the bad thief got his eye pecked out by a bird.  I kid you not. Therefore, these short, beautiful scenes are too few and far between to redeem the movie, though it's a shame because they were very well-done.The movie gets you so accustomed to blood that by the time when Jesus is basically all blood and no flesh, you're just ""...eh.""  It desensitizes you.  I was grossed out at first, then I grew used to it.  It also gives you two very pretty people to look at so you're not too offended (Mary Magdelen and the Apostle John)  Just when you think Jesus can't bleed anymore, he does.Also, the lack of accuracy drove me nuts because the whole point of the movie was to be accurate... that's even why they put it in Aramaic!  For instance, Jesus carried the entire cross and the nails were through his hands.  These have been proven to not be true; the wrists would have been pierced, and he would have just carried the horizontal part of the cross.  Like I said, I wouldn't have cared as much if Gibson hadn't been so proud of his accurate portrayal.  Then again, my medical student brother-in-law told me that no one can bleed that much and survive, so maybe I am giving this movie too much credit.  It figures.I was NOT religiously touched nor enlightened; is there any person out there who thought that crucifixion was a walk in the park?  If anything, the movie's total attitude was so stifling and had so much self-grandeur that I had to keep from laughing at times.  I mean, it was completely ludicrous.When I went to Confirmation class to discuss the movie with my fellow catechumists, I found that I was not alone. Our catechist was very surprised to see that all of us had hated the movie and none of us were at all touched.  A guy from my school summed up how we all felt: ""They didn't tell us anything about Jesus.  It was like watching a stranger get killed.""  I think that's a good way of putting it.  I didn't feel like the person getting maimed was my Lord and Savior.  I mean, lots of people were crucified.  I need to see a little more than that.Frankly, it scares me that there are people who bought this movie and will be watching it more than once.  To me, it is hollow and I get more out of hearing the Passion read at Palm Sunday mass, or attending the Holy Week masses like the Easter Vigil, or even listening to Jesus Christ Superstar, which is what I like to do every Good Friday.  Heck, I got more profound religious meaning out of a documentary on the Shroud of Turin than this tripe."	1.0	Takes itself so seriously you just have to laugh	2005-01-19	81	42	39
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1QIXLBEGT5BA	Katie	For all of you Catholics who have followed the Homily during Palm Sunday and to all who follow the Christian tradition, we quickly realize how historically and Biblically accurate Mel Gibson's Passion really was when we followed up with the readings during the high holy days. He should be commended for backing it with his money, his faith, his direction, and his heart. It was amazing! It was intellectually stimulating and certainly questioned the faith of all of His people,that would include the Romans and the Jews who seem to be pointing fingers throughout history over who killed Jesus. The point was, He was meant to die to give us all life ever after. Controversy only sold more tickets. This was surely the best movie of last year and perhaps one of the best ever made. The only finger pointing that should take place will be at the academy if this does not win best picture, best actor and best director at the Academy Awards.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1JS0MHHN5KAAE	Katie	The Passion of the Christ is a wonderful movie. Mel Gibson had a lot of guts to make a movie about Jesus told in such a violent way(which by the way is the way it happened...sad isn't it). Most people know that the movie isn't a happy movie that you can watch without crying. The movie is the most violent movie that I have ever seen. Because I heard the movie was so violent and gory, I was very skeptical about seeing this movie. But when my friend said that the movie changed her life, I decided to watch it with her. I ended up holding her hand almost the whole time (until the end of course because I needed both of my hands to wipe all of the tears away from my eyes. I have never cried so much in a movie. Even though the movie is very sad and extremely hard to watch, there are a few happy parts in the movie(especially the very end). I suggest any Christian and especially non-Christian to watch this spiritually moving movie.	4.0	A spiritually moving movie!	2005-02-23	7	5	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"...The Passion Of The Christ:NOTE: This movie can be seen from two perspectives, which are film and religion.  Since the review of the movie will be different depending what perspective it is seen from, I will do both.The Passion Of The Christ (Film Perspective):(* * 1/2)STORY: The story itself is quite weak yet powerful when it needs to be.  The last twelve hours of Jesus's life are depicted with extreme brutality, and here is where the problem lies.  I'm sure there is a story beneath the blood but it's hard to dig out.  Jesus's message was love and he believed in his ""father"", and he stood up for his beliefs.  The movie starts out very interesting I must say, but once the punishment begins on Jesus the whole motive of what Gibson is trying to say is lost in a haze of brutal beatings and lacerations.  Gibson said that he wanted to ""shock"" people, showing him what Jesus went through for the sins of mankind and to me he did a good job, but was that his only motive of the film?  To me it seemed so.  The message I got from the movie is ""This is Jesus, he died for our sins, and we must cherish him for it"".  The beatings are very brutal, some of the most if not the most brutal scenes ever filmed.  In one instance Jesus is whipped with multiple shards of metal that hook the skin and when pulled it rips the skin.  The crucifixion is quite bloody yet powerful because it does the job of ""shocking"" people.  Every now and then we enter a flashback where Jesus recounts his work for god and in delivering his message, and to me that is where the story that Mel is trying to tell is trying to jump out.  The most impact that came out of the movie for me was the cinematography.  The movie was beautifully shot, and I mean beautifully, especially the amber toned colors used.  In the end I saw the real story poking out here and there but just as it did the audience gets another heavy dose of brutality.ACTING: The acting is very well done, given the circumstance that there is hardly any dialogue and when there is dialogue it is very simple.  I did find it impressive how James Caviezel was able to show true pain through his facial expression, the audience really felt his suffering, and that is a real high point of the movie.BOTTOM LINE: A movie that is worth seeing not for the story but for the result of the movie as a whole.  Some parts I was saying ""oh come on"", especially during Jesus's walk up to the hill carrying his cross and being beaten every inch of the way.  I know he has gone through more pain than any man could bare but there was one too many slow motion shots of Jesus falling down as if that were his last step only to get up again and continue.  In the end it is very powerful and emotional, but if you're not religious don't expect to be moved too much.The Passion Of The Christ (Religious Perspective):(* * * 1/2)STORY: A powerful and moving experience that depicts Jesus's last twelve hours.  In the film audiences will embrace the suffering that Jesus had to encounter in his sacrifice for all of man's sins.  Mel Gibson depicts evil in this film in some very disturbing scenes. ""Evil"" is depicted throughout the film as a pale hooded being with no eyebrows, no hair actually at all.  In one scene Judas is trying to rid some children who are yelling at him for being cursed and he sees evil and disturbing faces upon them.  In another scene the ""Evil"" figure is carrying a demonic looking child who smiles at Jesus as his skin is being literally ripped off.  In one very moving scene a man who is forced from the watching crowd to help Jesus carry his cross tries to alienate himself from the situation at first only in the end to be connected with Jesus.  The crucifixion of Jesus is the most brutal yet the most moving, you will see some very realistic brutality.  The nailing of the hands and feet are probably the most brutally depicted act in film history.  Never once does Jesus argue with the men and women who accuse him and as he hangs from the cross he pleads with God to forgive them.  A powerful message stated is to ""love your enemies"" because loving and praying only for your loved ones shows no humanity.  Jesus's message is peace and love.  There have been many controversies over the film being anti-Semitic, blaming the Jews for Jesus's death.  I found no such instance of that in the film and if you decide not to see it for that reason, you should think it over.ACTING: The portrayals of the biblical characters were moving and emotional.  Jesus was portrayed excellently.  The reaction of his family was poignant and heart filled with sadness and loss.  Moving performances from the entire ensemble.BOTTOM LINE: A moving experience that will open eyes for people to the history of this tragic event.  It is shocking, and brutal.  Definitely not for the young even if it is for religious purposes, do not take a child to a movie like this leave the biblical cartoons for them on Sunday mornings.  Mel Gibson's vision can be seen as flawed in the movie making world but as a message it is strong and out there."	3.0	The Passion Is An Extraordinary Film	2004-03-14	7	2	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2WECV4STJ7P7X	Kay W. Holleran	I went to this movie by myself in the middle of the day.  Once the movie began, you could hear a pin drop.  I have read several of the other reviews and I wonder if I am the only one that felt ashamed for what Jesus had to go through for the human race.  I think that it was well done and I still can't get the images of Jesus out of my mind.  After the movie, I went to my church to receive ashes.  I could not believe how much the things in the church had changed.  I think Mr. Gibson did a wonderful job.  I don't feel that it will cause anti-semitic problems unless we let it.  If it does, I believe it will be because the people causing the Jewish people problems are ashamed of what was done to Jesus.  I would recommend it for anyone over the age of 16.  If people will admit that not just the Jews were responsible for Jesus' death, but ALL people before Jesus' birth and after his birth up until the present day, maybe we all could learn to love one another and the world would have peace.  As long as people don't look at people inside instead of just outside, this world is in a world of hurt. The people walking out of the theater didn't seem to want to make eye contact or speak.

In the bible, Isaiah 52:13-14, ( please don't stop reading because I said the ""B"" word, Bible)it says that His visage was marred more then ANY man. Even though others during Jesus' time were beaten brutally, (it was a very brutal time) Jesus was marred beyond recognition, as the bible tells us. That's pretty darn marred if you are not recognizable. You must also remember that at the core of Christian belief (based on scripture)is that fact that we believe that Jesus took ALL of our transgressions, iniquities, griefs, sorrows and sicknesses through being stricken, afflicted, beaten and crucified. All of which are listed in Isaiah 53 and Galations 3:13. This includes believers and non believers, past, present and future. All of mankind. So please, before you question the necessity of the amount of beatings in this movie, know that it was actually much worse for Jesus... as we see from the above scriptures. Thanks for your time...

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ADGDG88YCXPM4	K. DelGardo	I went to see this movie with my fiancee...he was raised Jewish and actually didnt even believe in God..I was a pretty much lapsed christian...celebrated Christmas, bought candy and stuffed bunnies on Easter, I claimed that I &quot;believed&quot; in Jesus...but I didnt change anything about my life because of it...I just went about my life in my own way...Anyway my fiancee and I actually got into a fight on the way to the movie because we were running late and he wanted to stop by a liquor store and get a bottle of rum so we could spike our cokes...we ended up just going to the movie without the rum.I was angry and annoyed with him and I said a short prayer when the movie began, &quot;Lord, please speak to him during this movie..make him know you are real&quot; Thats just what He did! I finally realized during the course of the movie what my Beloved Savior did for me, for my fiancee, for everyone in that theatre, everyone in the world...he took the hit that we deserved. The Lord God Almighty is so very holy, so very rightous, that our sin keeps us separated from him, there is nothing WE can do about that either. Jesus, the only truly sinless and perfect man, the only begotten Son of the Living God had to become our Passover Lamb...the ultimate sacrifice that covers all our sins for all eternity...the very simple and easy thing we can do is acknowledge that! The only thing we need to do (and have to do) is believe that! Our sins are covered in the Blood of the Lamb of God, making us right in the eyes of a God that is SO good, SO holy, SO intolerant of sin that he cant even tolerate it near him. My fiancee and I left the movie and we didnt speak to each other for about 15 minutes...finally I asked him how he felt. He said, &quot;ashamed...humbled&quot; He asked me how I felt and I said, &quot;greatful...so very greatful.&quot; The benefits are amazing, the peace now is a miracle. The God shaped hole in both of our lives has been filled. My fiancee converted to Christianity and he lives for God everyday of his life! I re-embraced my faith and its stronger and more meaninful than it has ever been. The transforming power of the Holy Spirit is in this movie...dont be afraid of it, let it change you for the better! There is no drug, no high, no thrill more fulfilling than to address the needs of your soul. You feed your body food, you breathe the oxygen your body needs, you drink the water that hydrates your body...why do people ignore the spirit? It affects everything else in your body. If your spirit is empty and disconnected from the source of Spiritual Life, how can you be happy and healthy?Yes, the movie is gory, disturbing, painful to watch...I cried so much during the movie, and so did my fiancee. Seeing what He did for me. Its beautifully directed, acted and filmed. The violence is there for a reason...because it really happened! The Romans werent exactly known for their warm and fuzzy natures! They were brutal!Oh, and on the anti-semetic note...I really didnt see it. What I got was the conservatives of the day, the Pharisees and Sadducees feared the changing power of Jesus. They feared that they'd get squeezed out of a job because with the sacrifice of the Lord, there was no need for a priest to speak with God for us...we could come &quot;boldly before the throne&quot; and speak with him ourselves...because of the Blood of the Lamb of God made us clean in the eyes of God. Just because Jesus didnt come to them in the appearance that they were expecting so they rejected. Something else other anti-semetics dont realize is that if the Jewish authorities of the day didnt insist on the death of Jesus, there would be no grace, no remissions of sins, no salvation. Maybe they should thank the Jews, after all...the God that Christians worship chose the Jews to be his people!Thanks to this movie, we are bible believing, church going Christians now...and the Lord God through the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ saved us from a life of emptyness and despair. He replaced it with love, hope and peace.	5.0	LIFE CHANGING!	2004-07-25	36	26	10

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A255DD5NKP1210	Kehoe	"Despite everything everyone says bad about this movie, like:it makes it look like the Jews killed Jesus, or its historically inacurate; this movie is good. It is very acurate to the Bible, very extremly realistic in how he dies, and it doesn't make it look like the Jews killed Jesus. In the movie, its a small group of high priests of the Jewish religion, trying to kill Jesus. During the priest's trial of Jesus, one of the priests even comes out and says ""where is the rest of the consul?"", and they only push him away. Its very clear (unless you're stupid) that the ""Jews"" didn't kill Jesus, only a small group of high priests, and some followers. It is also very, very, very acurate to the Bible, and it sort of combines all four Gospels. Another thing: this movie is very brutal, and the violence is very graphic; from the scourging of Jesus, to the crucifixion itself. It shows his skin being ripped apart in the scourging, a thorn crown with the thorns being pushed into his head, his hands and feet being nailed to the cross, and him suffering on the cross. So if you can't take someone being tortured badly, or you're thinking of taking a younger person (around 13.5 and younger) because its a movie about Jesus, don't. It is very violent. That doesn't stop it from being a great movie, so go see it. What i didn't like about the movie was, it should have done more on the resurrection. The crucifixion is a big part of the Christian religion, because he saved us from sin on the cross, but the resurrection is bigger. They only had a little part at the end showing the tomb opening, with Jesus standing up with holes in his hands. But, whether your curious to see what happens to Jesus, or a devout Christian, go see it."	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-02-26	4	3	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AGHVQ841IR6GO	Keith C. Bradbury	"This movie will not leave your head. You may walk out of the theatre numbed, stricken, or even uncertain of what you have just seen, but it will sink in and stick in your mind for long after you have seen the movie.The movie has chosen to focus on the moments from the Garden of Gethsemane to the events immediatately following the crucifixion, with an ""epilogue"" touching on the resurrection and a handful of ""flashbacks"" to break the intensity of the graphic details of the torture of Jesus. In Catholic terms, the movie has focused primarily on the ""stations of the Cross.""If the movie has any failings, it may be that it does not explain all of the imagery that it chooses to use, which at times are either extra-Biblical (not contained within the Gospel narratives) or ""artistic interpretations."" But often, such imagery can cause one to seek the deeper meanings represented by them, so it is not necessarily bad to have these. Some of these scenes are cultural (for example, Mary wipes up the blood of Jesus with a cloth, which is a culturally accurate portrayal, as the blood was buried with the body of those who died). Others are artistic interpretations (a snake proceeds from Satan, which Jesus crushes the head of, which is a signifying of the fulfillment of the prophecy of Genesis 3:15; this is not something that Jesus did literally in the Garden, but accomplished through His death). Some scenes, however, border on the bizarre (causing me to actually question why Mel saw the point of actually including them): Satan with the baby (presumably carrying the anti-Christ, although this is never truly explained), the psychotic apparitions experienced by Judas, or the crow incident with the thief on the cross (completely unscriptural and oddly out-of-place). I'm certain they had significant meaning to Mr. Gibson, thus their inclusion, but these may be lost on the audience.While this is a movie that depicts violence, it in no way glorifies it. The amount of violence can be numbing to some, overwhelming to others. However, the depiction is accurate, including the Roman use of ""the cat of nine tails,"" which featured a whip with nine lashes, each typically having shards of metal or glass to rip the flesh during torture. The Romans were notoriously violent, ruthless, and on the average, they absolutely hated the Jews. To them, Jesus was another Jew and they no doubt took great delight in delivering out punishments on this magnitude. In fact, historians recording the events of the sacking of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 AD commented that there was ""no room to plant a cross"" because the Romans crucified just about every Jew they got their hands on.Some have questioned whether Pilate should have been portrayed in such a sympathetic light. Certainly, historians of that period identified him with tremendous cruelty, saying that he delighted in freely shedding the blood of the Jewish people in times of irritibility. In AD 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, after which he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide. In all likelihood, Pilate saw Jesus as simply another Jew, dispicable in his eyes. This view may have changed after the prompting of his wife, who had dreams regarding Jesus' innocence, or it may have changed during his actual encounter with Jesus. Pilate had put down numerous rebellions before, but Jesus was completely unlike the other anti-Roman elements he had crushed previously. Unlike the power-greedy Sanhedrin, Jesus did not ""suck up"" to him. Nor, like the zealots and leaders of previous revolts, did Jesus curse and defy him. Perhaps, in these moments, he truly came to see Jesus as unlike those he had encountered before. We are never truly told what Pilate thought regarding Jesus, apart from the Biblical account that he did not believe the accusations regarding his guilt.Some may wonder, ""Why is there so much focus placed on the torture and blood of Jesus in this film?"" Central to the Christian faith is that it is by the blood of Jesus we receive forgiveness of sins. Mr. Gibson has chosen to focus on this central element. Every individual is guilty of sin that separates us from God; sin that must be atoned for by the blood of the perpetrator (the penalty of death). Rather than accept this as the ultimate fate for all of His creation, He allowed for the substitutionary willing sacrifice of Jesus, who was both fully God and fully man. That Mel Gibson chose to depict his own hands as driving the nails into Jesus was Mel's way of showing what His very sin had caused, but what God so willingly gave in order to forgive him.Amazingly, in spite of early charges of anti-Semetism, this film goes out its way to present the Jewish people with a dignified realism. Yes, there were the powerful who saw Jesus as a threat to their power. There were others who saw through this and refused to be a party to an illegal trial. There were others who wanted to go about their own life, but were thrust into the middle of the whole situation.Ultimately, this movie is about one message, and one message alone. It is central to the blood, the violence depicted against Jesus, and the ultimate reasons behind the crucifixion. That message is that there is only one way to restore the relationship between God and man, and that is through the substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus (His blood). That is why Mel Gibson chooses to focus in on lines like, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except by Me"" and the flashbacks to the Last Supper, where Jesus depicts the bread and wine as His body and blood, given freely for their salvation. Even the Jewish leaders give reference, in their accusations against Jesus to Pilate, that Jesus said they must ""eat his flesh and drink his blood"" (not that Jesus was speaking of cannibalism here, but that He was clearly teaching that His self-sacrifice was central to the salvation of humanity)."	4.0	It will stick in your head.	2004-03-02	6	5	1

It is something I will never forget for the rest of my life. I would feel bad in saying that I liked this movie because the whole movie was basically the pain and suffering of Jesus Christ,and it hurt me emotionally to watch that.But I can say that it was a great account of the last 12 hours of Jesus's life and I am very glad I saw it.I think that EVERYONE should see this movie.Even nonreligious people.It will intensify the faith of Christians and humble nonreligious people.The images from this movie will stay in my mind forever.A lot of people are bothered by the violence in this movie but it is all what really happened.The cast in this movie was incredible.No one could have played Jesus better than Jim Caviezel.The woman who played Mary was incredible.Just her facial expressions while watching her son suffer made me burst into tears.And I don't know who played Satan, but that face will stay in my mind forever.It was one of the scariest things I've ever seen.When I went to see this movie, I don't think there was one person in the audience who said one word throughout the last hour of the movie.Except for those people who were not able to watch because they were crying too hard,who walked out in the middle of the movie because they couldn't take it.After the movie was over,not one word was said from anyone in the audience.It took everybody a couple of minutes to get up from their seats.I've never seen a reaction like this when I've gone to a movie, ever.And I see a lot of movies in theatres.I only found a few things that I didn't like about this movie.First of all,the beating and the violence becomes very repetitive so the movie doesn't really give the audience a break from crying.And I think this movie could have focused a little more on the life of Jesus,rather than his death.Also,if you are not familiar with the story,it will become very confusing.I read a lot about it before I went to see it and I was still confused in a couple parts but if I hadn't read what I had, I would have had no idea what was going on.Other than this,it was a great account of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ that I will not forget as long as I live.	5.0	Passion of the Christ is powerful and brutal	2004-03-13	3	2	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2HG5MY4YOY7N2	Kelvin H.	"I am a moviegoer and not a scholar of religion so it is my obligation to critique ""The Passion of the Christ"" aesthetically. Therefore, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a great movie that will forever resonate in the history of the cinema. It is a beautifully shot film where the contrast between darkness and light accentuates the beauty of the aura of Jesus Christ. Unlike other Biblical adaptations, Gibson's new film is flushed with dramatic colors that appear gritty in order to emphasize realism. It is not idealized for it is emphatically proven through the sheer violence.The movie opens with Jesus in the evening at the Garden of Gethsemane, where everything appears cold and vile. Caleb Deschanel, the cinematographer, does an exquisite job in painting out the mood with its contrast between shadows and light. At first, Gibson did not want to include subtitles because he wanted to tell the story through images alone and I believe it would have been persuasive. In a story where it clearly deals with the battle between good and evil, Gibson and Deschanel designed the cinematography where lightness and darkness are fighting for their share of screen space.""The Passion of the Christ"" deals with the last twelve hours of Jesus' life with occasional flashbacks. There is no setup or a background insight as to why Jesus is being persecuted but there is no need for it because the only importance is the sacrifice of Jesus. Also, I guess Gibson expects us to know and if not, we should research. There is not much plot but simply the journey Jesus makes carrying the burden of the wooden cross up to Golgotha. Gibson basically follows the story set by the scriptures but only twice does he deviate from it. The first is introducing Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) into the narrative and the second is adding more emphasis to the role of Simon of Cyrene. The Satan character is done so seductively that it will send chills down your spine. I love how Gibson chose to portray evil as beautiful, seductive, and wicked as a way to entice desires. I also admire Gibson for adding depth to the character of Simon of Cyrene who helps Jesus carry the cross. It addles me how even with Gibson's mold of Simon of Cyrene; people still dare to accuse him and this film of being anti-Semitic and the ignition of it."	5.0	The Best Depiction of the Bible	2004-02-28	4	4	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2D9IEFJGB483Q	Kendal B. Hunter	"Passion Re-CutThis is a review of the Recut edition of ""The Passion.""  The film flows easily and the six missing minutes were not needed.  Gibson should have left the film unrated, and left out these offensive six minutes in the first place.  Notwithstanding this, I was quite impressed with Gibson's directorial abilities. He is quite a talent, akin to Nemoy or even Welles. I hope he nurtures this gift.As to the content, there is nothing new in this movie. The bare facts of the Christ's Atonement have been film and refilmed man times with many different actors.  The only new things deal with cinematography, and then the presentation of the side characters.  And the intensity of the violence.  Of course the Romans were not wimps, and scourging and crucifixion were excruciating.  Gibson saw as his goal the most accurate representation of this scourging. IMHO, we get the idea, and to emphasize the gore is emphasizing just one aspect of the Atonement, and it can distract from the ultimate victory.I found the subtitles helpful. You get the idea, but the film is infinitely better when we see Christ's almost nonchalant approach to his death.  He takes time to mister words to his mother (only a Catholic would pick up on this), keeps his peace with Herod, debates philosophy with Pilate (in Latin), and is absolutely above it all.  He must be a lunatic, or . . .In addition to the subtitles, the subtleties were also helpful.  You see Pilate caught between his wife's dream, his sense of honor, and the pragmatic desire to keep peace and keep his political position.  The encounter with Claudia and the Marys (something only a Catholic would see) is priceless.As to the alleged anti-Semitism, I just remind people about Seinfeld's Uncle Leo.  The reason why Seinfeld created Uncle Leo is that many people make anti-Semitic accusations at the drop of the hat, or as they are passing the hat.  This is just a way to avoid dealing with Gibson's message and passion.SPOILER WARNING:I am a bit critical of the special effects, specifically the snake-up-the-nose, and the growling troll under the bridge.  I understand that the Gollum-Baby was an attempt to mock the true Madonna.  However, these scenes gave the film a ""Lord of the Rings"" feel. It may be asserted that this is the TRUE Lord of the Rings, but to give the Atonement a surrealistic feel could leave some people with the idea that the Atonement is surreal.  Then God is surreal, and ultimately we are surreal-like the Matrix.I understand that devils are real, but they were depicted as run-of-the-mill ""Scary Teen Movie"" type bogeymen.  Frankly, some people cannot make the distinction.  This film was not allegory, as Narnia or Middle-Earth, but a historical film.  Keep the two separate.END OF SPOILERGibson, in addition to being a devout Catholic, is a good Kierkegaardian.  Both understand the relationship between aesthetics, ethics, and spirituality.  If you can artistically present the spiritual and ethical, then you are likely to succeed in presenting your message.  For some people, this is the only experience with the Atonement.  If people can get past this film, and find God, then this film will be successful."	5.0	Review of recut, NR Edition	2005-03-15	12	7	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1XXBVRRNGBG5Y	kendall lopere	"Well, I have to admit I wasn't expecting to like this movie, having read all the bad press surrounding it.  But I saw it last night on a whim and I have to say I thought it was fantastic!  Firstly, as a movie it is incredibly well shot.  The scenery is wonderful and the sets are painstakingly recreated - never once do you doubt this is 1st century Palestine.The acting starts off a little strained in the garden scene, when the movie is just finding it's feet (and the audience is coming to terms with the fact that the movie isn't some horrible, cheap propaganda short, but a proper movie) but quickly becomes impressive and ends up brutally real.Gibson has set out to make a compelling dramatization of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life as described in the Gospels and that's pretty much what he does.  There is certain artistic license taken and some good abstract movie-making, but nothing that really detracts from the movie or the sentiment.  In fact the scenes where they have the Billy Corgan/ Marylin Manson devil figure floating around are amongst the strongest scenes in the movie (Especially the gratuitously freakish defomed child at the whipping! What was that about?!).  The movie is shocking, and at times painful to watch.  I think the movie only strays into questionably graphic violence occasionally, most notable when Christ's hands are nailed to the cross and we see blood squirting up onto the Roman soldier's smirking face.  That's a touch over the top for my taste.Being an UWS-dwelling New Yorker, I had the anti-Semitic accusations in the back of my mind for the whole movie, and I have to say I found nothing that could possibly be construed as anti-Semitic.  Instead the movie shows a nuanced and balanced set of Jewish characters who run the gamut of emotions from hating Jesus to loving him from falsely accusing him to insisting on a fair trial.  To read some press reviews I'd assumed the movie was full of big-nosed demons laughing maniacally in shadowy corners - that impression is patently absurd, in fact even Jesus' Pharisee accusers are sickened by his whipping and turn away in anguish and perhaps contrition.  If anything it is the Romans who 2000 years later are amongst Catholicism's staunchest supporters, that revel in the torture and mockery of Christ.  But hey, it's all there in the gospels.I think this is a pretty ""Catholic"" film.  Historically the Catholic faith has always revered the human side of Jesus more strongly.  They worship him for his suffering on our behalf his death for our sins, and yes his long, drawn out death.  Speaking from the Protestant tradition I'd prefer to see a movie that celebrated Jesus' life and teachings more than his suffering, and perhaps brought out the good news of his resurrection more than this movie, but hey, Mel has another 33 years of material to work with should he choose to make a sequel or a prequel.I'm not sure that this movie will make many converts - it's a compelling and powerful piece of art, but any theology is brief and death related - flashbacks to scenes in Jesus' earlier ministry deal with specific death prophesies (""This is my Body, broken for you..."" etc) or somewhat heavy-handed juxtapositions of his teaching vs his treatment (""Love thy neighbour, and love thine enemy likewise."").  I'm not sure that this condensed and selective teaching will convert anyone up front, but it's already made me reread a few of the gospels.Anyway, I think it's a movie everyone should see to make up their own mind about - personally I can't wait for the DVD release so I can watch it without subtitles, as Gibson originally intended. That'd be even more brutal..."	5.0	"""Quid Est Veritas?"""	2004-03-03	8	4	4

Mel Gibson has presented an accurate, biblical portrayal of the final hours of Christ's life before the crucifixion.That is why the Isaiah passage is quoted at the beginning of this movie.  Anyone who reads this scripture can clearly see ""He was wounded FOR OUR transgressions, bruised FOR OUR iniquities...""  Mel Gibson's point is clear:  It is OUR sin that caused Christ to die.  Anyone with any sense whatsoever will not blame the Jewish people because they were not to blame for Christ's death.

But this is a film for viewers of any belief or none at all. Not to be converted or anything like that. Rather, Gibson's film is about experiencing the spiritual moment (filmaker and critic Paul Schrader calls it transcendental experience). The point is to make one feel not believe.

Though that film featured enough  blood and flying limbs to rival your average zombie movie, Wallace's torture was mostly left to the viewers imagination since the camera didn't actually show blades connecting with flesh.This is not the case with ""The Passion of the Christ"" which shows, in gruesome detail, the scourging of the Messiah and his eventual crucifixion.  I have to wonder, did it really need to go so far over the top in these scenes?Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the Bible knows that Christ suffered for our sins but with ""The Passion"" Mel Gibson seems to be saying, ""Hey kids, Christ really, really, REALLY suffered for your sins.""  I know this and can accept that as Gibson's interpretation of the gospel.  But I still find myself wondering,  ""What was the point?""This is not to say that the film is bad.  The direction and cinematography is excellent and the performances are uniformly superb.  Plus you have to admire Gibson's tenacity and unwavering commitment to getting this film made his way even as major studios ran from it in fear of its explosive subject matter.  The film could just as easily have been titled ""The Passion of Mel Gibson"" given that this was clearly a labor of love project, which as we all know by now has paid off handsomely for him.As of this writing, ""The Passion"" is one of the top 10 grossing films of all time and still climbing.But you still have to wonder if, in focusing so much of the film on Christ's brutal last hours, if Gibson didn't blow an opportunity to present an even more intimate and eye-opening view of his life.  To me, some of the film's most interesting scenes are the flashbacks earlier points in his life.  During these scenes we see his interaction if his disciples, with Mary Magdalene, and with his mother Mary.In fact, one of most fascinating scenes is one depicting Christ at home building a table and then sitting at it to discuss his craft with his mother.  I wanted more scenes like that.Of course, many could argue that this would have made for a much different movie.  Maybe.  But it might have also resulted in one an even better one as well."	3.0	On Passion and Violence	2004-10-04	0	0	0

I am however, a believer of Christ.I had heard about the film at the same time I also heard about the anti-semetic tags that were being pronouned on its director and determined to judge for myself, I went to see it.  The cinema was full and I sat down a mix of nervous anticipation and the feeling what I can only describe as ""voyeristic guilt"" swept over me..(I won't waste your time by detailing elements of the film - there are enough synopsis-laden reviews present..)The film to be frank, is unrelenting and contains some of the most brutal violence likely to be ever shown on screen.  However, it is entirely because of this that ""The Passion"" is so totally compelling..  Mel Gibson's direction at times has been to throw the camera right in the midst of the torture; basically where you would least prefer to look if you were given a choice.  In doing this, you are conciously reminded that the beatings, the flagilation and ultimately the cruxifiction are not areas to be shyed away - there is no luxery of choice in watching this film..Despite the unrelenting bloodiness, ""The Passion"" also captures a quiet tenderness within the flashback sequences..  The flashbacks between a young Jesus and his mother Mary are only for a few minutes, but they provide a massive understanding towards Mary's struggle to find and comfort her dying son.In its finality people can mock the film, asking ""where's the laughs""... or people can question the religous continuity within the Bible.  I am not here to do that.  I am thankful that such a masterpiece has been made that has given me the understanding of Jesus and how he died without forcing its own opinion down my throat."	5.0	....Is it possible for a film to change your life?	2004-06-08	3	3	0

Because of this he was able to settle the debt we have built with our sins buy acting as a human sacrifice. This movie gives us a look at how his final hours may have transpired. It's very powerful and very upsetting.This is an incredible movie. It is passionate, as the title suggests, and very realistic. The acting is perfect and the message is timeless. Whether you believe that Jesus was the son of God or not, you can appreciate the passion and love he had for his fellow man. It's amazing to think that he endured what he did as a human, when he also possessed the power of God. If you can handle the brutality and emotional toll this film will take on you, I strongly recommend it. Be ye warned! It's extremely graphic and hard not to look away from at times.	5.0	Very Emotional and Powerful	2012-11-23	1	1	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AZQLDLVVX9PE	"Kevin King ""keloki"""	"I saw it. Wow!If, having never seen it, you feel convicted that it is a ""bad historical interpretation,"" that it is categorically anti-Semitic, that is is an expression of Mel Gibson's father, not Mel Gibson, that it will cause anti-Jewish uprisings, and the like; then you will have to work real hard, but you can probably keep those impressions after seeing it. However, you would have to be living in a world of your own illusions.Having seen ""The Passion of The Christ,"" it was obvious that this was not about Jews, nor about Romans. It was about Jesus and his choice to complete this sacrifice. It was about the telling of an extremely compelling story that changed history. And this is such an important juncture in history that it has affected all of us ever since.We can sit here in armchairs and judge the accounts that were written in the Bible, saying ""it was not typically done that way.."" and conclude that the witnesses in the Bible must be wrong. But at critical junctures in history such as this, things go differently than usual. Many accidents have won wars, many odd or uncharacteristic decisions have changed the fate of nations. This was one of those times.It seems that we will more easily accept blatant and odious corruptions like ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""The DiVinci Code,"" yet rip to shreds a work that endeavors to stay true to fact.See the movie first.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A8VUHH1XDO9N	"Kevin Nazario Bartolomei ""Sazabi"""	"Yes, I know there are over 2,000 reviews here but I think mine can be more specific with too many words. First of all this is Christ's Passion as Mel Gibson sees it, is his particular gospel. Is a very personal, very pious  version but it is not attach to the canonical gospels, there are too many deviations from scripture to call it ""base on them"" . Gibson used many sources outside of the Bible. Second is not historically acurate in many things. The most basic one is that the common language back then and in that area was greek, the english of the times, so you can bet when Jesus and Pilate spoke it wasn't in latin, it was probably greek, even when is very possible people back then knew the basis of many other languages and local dialects. And not going to talk about the whole crucifixion thing, anyone with a small background in ancient history knows is based on medieval images and misconceptions, is not at all a first century execution.Perhaps the most talk about aspect of the film is the violence. Ok, Jesus received one hell of a beating, you can be sure about that, but nobody would have arrives alive at the cross after the one in the movie, even if you consider Him(as I do)to be perfect God, perfect man. I understand this is like a painting in motion, a way of display the idea of God's eternal love for us and his sacrifice for those that are not worthy of been forgiven.Is Art, is an interpretation, but I believe Gibson and his crew went to far. The whole scourging secuence could have been half that long and the impact kept the same.That said is a good movie, it shakes you to the core. My favorite scene, well is not on the Bible but it makes perfect sense, is when satan is tempting Jesus in the garden and a snake appears coming from Satan's robes crawling towards Him. Then Jesus stands and squashs the snake's head looking at the enemy with a firm ""I am God, don't come with your cheap tricks to Me"" stare. That's my God!!!, and He gets pushed by no one.If you want to see the movie, go ahead, but remember this is an artistic interpretation of the Lord's final hours, and a very violent one. Elderly people and children under 12 should stay away from this one."	3.0	A moving film, but very innacurate and needdesly gory	2009-10-24	8	3	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3NVN6RBBBQ0JQ	Kevin Pazyck	A touchy subject is a touchy subject. Many conclusions have expectedly been argued from many fronts. It's brutally forthright in its vision. I, without seeing the theater release (I didn't really want to be exposed to other opinions until I had my own), wanted to dismiss POTC as a vehicle for media sensationalism and Hollywood glorification. Mel did a fine job making Braveheart a bloodbath and thought this was an extension of that style. And it still is in many respects, obviously.I read the Bible. I own the DVDs JESUS and THE GOSPEL OF JOHN. They both bring up valid viewpoints and portrayals of the Christ (even if the GOSPEL OF JOHN is quite literally a linear interpretation of the Book of John). Both celebrate the *life* and *message* of Jesus. What POTC does differently is tell that message cinematically through the betrayal and scourging and ultimately His Crucifixation. I especiallly approve with the decision to use languages native of the time. Mel spends some cash on this piece and it's a risk for the casual viewer. But obviously anyone who does his or her homework can follow along without subtitles quite effortlessly. Remember that POTC is *not* meant to be a substitute for the written Word. It is an artistic scrutiny of Jesus's final hours.The DVD's anamorphic 2.40:1 widescreen layout is simply put; breathtaking. The picture quality is on par with the best of 'em. The audio is also put to good use. Listen to the crowds laughing and murmuring during the Christ's trial. The dialog is clear and makes the Aramaic easier to digest. The only thing holding back a 5 star rating is a lack of extras other than setup options and the chapter list. But it was expected and one look at the back of the DVD revealed what was (and wasn't) on there. We obviously know 20th Century Fox is gonna put out an extremely thorough version in the (hopefully) near future.Summarily, it's simply and awesome movie once you get past all the surface hyperbole. I tried to hate it before seeing it. But once you get inside Mel's head, you will begin to maybe understand it is only one man's secular version of the Greatest Story Ever Told, or at least a part of it.	4.0	riveting cinematography	2004-09-02	12	11	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"""The Passion Of The Christ"" is a violent film.  I won't argue on that with anybody.  It's too violent for young children(and some adults), but I suggest watching it with older kids(thirteen and up) because there is so much more here than beatings and blood.  It's a true story about a man who died for the sins of the world.  Whether or not you believe that Christ was the Savior, you'd be sick to not have any type of feelings for Him in this film.  If you are a Christian, like myself, then you were probably moved or disturbed in a greater way than if you were an athiest.  If you are Jewish, then you might have been angered by the portrayal of your people.  Muslim, Buddhist, agnostic, etc., no matter who you are, you came out of this movie feeling different from everbody else.  None of that matters if you look at this film as being the story of a real person who is beaten and condemned to death for standing against the crowd.  The agony that Jesus endures in this film will wear you out.  This isn't a gorefest like some believe, it's real.  Mr. Gibson might have taken a few light liberties with the Gospel, but the point he gets across is that the final few hours of Jesus' human life on earth were barbaric, grotesque, emotionally and mentally draining, and full of both hatred and love toward Him.  Not only do you witness that, but you see the insanity that just might have gone on inside Judas' head after betraying Jesus.  You see the confusion and disbelief in Peter's eyes when he denies Jesus for the third time, just as Jesus said he would.  You see the agony and pain in Mary while watching her Son suffer.  The worry of possibly being held responsible for the death of the Christ is evident in Pontius Pilate's eyes as well.  Every person portrayed in this film reacts to the cruelty unfolding in front of them in a different way, just like it still happens today when we see people murdered, tortured, raped, etc. on the news and on the street.In all, this movie is a story about humanity.  We see the ugly side of ourselves in the Roman soldiers beating Jesus.  We see the love and warmth experienced between a mother and her son with the interaction of Jesus and Mary.  Everything plays out masterfully and with little dialogue.  That is why this film is worth five stars.  It's a great story about humans being humans.  That's why we are repulsed by the violence in it, because WE ARE CAPABLE of such violence.  That's also why we are moved by the love in this film, because WE ARE CAPABLE of that as well.In closing, don't view this film as a Christian, a Jew or anything else.  View it as a human-being and prepare yourself to see just how beautiful and ugly humanity can be.  Perhaps that is why this film evokes such extreme praise and hate.  It hits just a little too close to home."	5.0	Violent, Yes, But There's More To This Film	2004-09-03	14	10	4

The gore scenes in this film are extremley grade school compared to the way it really happened. There has never been or ever will be a civilization as decadent and barbaric as the roman empire. They were masters of torture and what the Jesus Christ suffered in this film was nothing even close to what the real Jesus Christ endured for us so we wouldn't have to go to Hell. The Non Christian who watches this film can not truly appreciate the love Jesus had for us going to the cross like the Christian can. Watch it not the gore scenes.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A37JKM7EFD0DIQ	K.H.	"Mel Gibson's movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" is probably the greatest movie ever made on the last hours of Jesus, exceeding all passion segemnts including ""The Gospel of St. Matthew"", Jesus of Nazareth"", and ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""  The film opens with Jesus being tempted in the garden, his trial before Caiaphis, Pilot, and Herod, the Roman's whipping him, carrying the cross, and his crucifixion and a very brief resurrection sequence.The film looks like it was crafted on a much larger budget than Gibson's 30 million dollar investment, which is modest compared to many hollywood films.  The acting is super.  Jim Caviezel probably gives the best portrayal of Jesus ever film. He is able, I assert, to give Jesus the universial appeal deserved in  such a character.  Maia Morgenstern is outstanding as Mary and her portrayal brings compassion from the viewer. Monica Bellucci is great as well.  One of the most intriging characters is how Mel uses Satan.  The charcater is adrongynces looking and comes at times in the film adding the dimension that this is more than a physical battle, but a truly spiritual war.  It is nothing short of genius.The film score compliments the film.  The film does suffer from some flaws.  The resurrection is so brief that Christ looks more like the victim than the victor.  Sure he was a victim, but as Lord he is also the victor, and after such an intense two hours of physical and spiritual violence, a stonger resurrection scene would have inspired more hope in the viewer.The flashback scenes are very necessary and allow the viewer to escape the violence in the film, if only for a minute.  Gibson has assempled an outstanding staff and has created probably the most outstanding Christian film in cinema history.A great movie to see during Lent as to contemplate the suffering of Christ."	5.0	A Unquie Film Expierence/5 Stars with Reservations	2004-02-27	1	1	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ is one of the films that have made film history before the actual release as it had a large number of followers before the release date. The prosperity of Gibson's film is based in its Christian theme, which attracted large masses of folks in the western world. The hysteria around the film was augmented through word of mouth as people were willing to discuss Passion of the Christ before it was released. This frenzy around the film brought the film a lot of free advertisement around the world, which made the film a huge success in the Box Office.The film follows the 12 hours before Jesus Christ's (James Caviezel) crucifixion, which is full of violent behavior. This violent behavior is brought to the screen through untouched brutality as the body of Jesus is kicked, desecrated, tortured, and whipped numerous times with monstrous tools before he was crucified. These scenes of violence progressively get worse as the film continues as Gibson makes an honest attempt to recreate a world of past where poverty and ignorance were common. There is not much room for compassion, but when it exists it offers some hope for mankind. It is for this hope that Jesus endures the pain brought upon him by mankind.Passion of the Christ is a cinematic experience that triggers a strong distaste for brutal violence as it is turned into a maximum in the film.  The violence is necessary in order to display the revolting behavior of people, which is nauseating, and it is for this violent behavior Jesus sacrifices himself to save mankind. Hopefully all the viewers learned one of the intended lessons from the story and can make the world a better place with less violence and brutality.	5.0	Gibson's violent depiction - A hope for mankind...	2004-09-22	15	10	5

We all sat there and watched as the credits and music played. I am not sure why we did this. Maybe we saw what life is truly about, and we didn't want it to end there. Or maybe we were shocked that this happened, and we have taken it for granted for all these years.What I do know is that this film is outstanding.

I bought the DVD before actually seeing the movie and I do not regret that decision.With all the blood and gore I kind of regret that I watched it with my cousins before viewing it myself-- by the end of the first half hour we all were crying... The scenes are so realistic and it is graphic. That you really have to make sure your children are mature enough to see some of them... As a religious person the movie made me really question my faith and my beliefs--It will make you do so too... The acting done is simply breathtaking and you enjoy the movie despite the fact it is Latin.And for all of those out there who think this film is anti-semetic it will create hatred towards Jews-- trust me it won't... for true followers of Christ know it was Christ's destiny to die on the cross-- if it hadn't been the Jews it would of been another group of people who crucified Christ.With beautiful music, a great cast, breath-taking scenry, and great acting the passion did not go wrong in any sense.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2NNTNC715AJ50	"Kindle Customer ""JKM"""	Despite all the controversy generated by Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, people have flocked to see it, myself included.  What I saw was a very moving, compelling and disturbing dramatization of the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  The violence in the movie was extreme, yet there were only a couple points that I would say were gratuitous.  One would be the very long procession to Golgatha and the second would be the crow incident.  Those who have seen the movie will undoubtedly undertand exactly what I am referring to.  Also a bit over-dramatized is the guilt of Judas Iscariot.  The scenes with the children beating him and Satan watching were truly disturbing.  Exactly what Gibson wanted but I am not sure if it was necessary.  I think that the movie is visually stunning and technically excellent.  It is well researched with excellent actors and actresses.  The use of subtitles does not in any way detract from the impact of the movie.  There are some criticisms however: 1) There is not enough of who Jesus is.  We see bits and pieces in flashback, but more could have been added during some of the more extreme scenes ie the second half of the flogging 2)There is not too much information about Jesus' followers. Peter is mentioned and John seen as is Judas but of the other 9 nothing.  Of the 2 Marys, one is obviously the mother of Jesus, but it is not apparant who the other is till much later.  For all the information you receive about her she could be any of the many women who followed Jesus.  The third and final criticism is about the finale.  Gibson spends the entire movie building up Jesus' suffering and death and the payoff is the Resurrection, but the Resurrection only gets maybe 30-45 seconds of screen time.  This is a bit of a letdown.  The audience has seen the suffering yet is really denied the triumph.  The actors do a great job in promoting emotion etc.  Caviezel plays Jesus with a quiet majesty and in the flashbacks, his performance is so good I wished for more.  As for the charges that film is anti-semitic, they are ludicrous.  First, historically, it was the leading pharasees who wished for Jesus death.  That is historic fact.  The Romans were instruments of that death.  Gibson's film points out that not all of the leaders wanted death for Jesus and many were oppossed to the trial itself.  The crowd was paid off as seen in the movie.  The brutality of many of the Romans is caused by the alcohol they drank before the crucifixtion, which is obvious especially around the cross.  The soldiers involved in the scourging did not seem to have an excuse for their cruelty, as they were not drinking.  Gibson does point out the sympathetic Romans also.  Unlike the TV movie Jesus from a couple years ago Pilot is portrayed not as insane but as indecisive and scared.  This also comes through.  Overall the Passion of the Christ is a very good movie that builds up to a climax that is underplayed.  It's not the best movie about Jesus ever made, that would probably be Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth, but it is a well-made thought provoking movie.	4.0	Powerful & Compelling Film, but Climax Lacking	2004-02-25	0	0	0

Why must be stressed is that the process of a Roman arrest, torture and Crucifixion is a visceral, bloody, and very difficult thing to watch, and the movie does not spare the detail - this coupled with the fact that it is Our Savior may make it too intense for some adults... it is most definitely NOT for children.	5.0	Excellent.. but beware	2014-03-21	1	1	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A209YFUDD03J3R	Kitten with a Whip	Beautifully directed. Casting was right on (loved that Mother Mary was not blue/blonde as usually depicted in Western Art...Also loved that Satan was outwardly beautiful.) The story was faithful to the New Testament telling of Jesus' last day. I saw NO anti-Semitism. The story is as it was. I loved the original language, it gave the words we know by heart such power. It was brutally explicit in depicting the physical condition of Jesus by the time he was crucified... but again, this is the truth of the story. As a Christian, you need to keep looking and watching, especially if it makes you uncomfortable. The actors, each and every one, conveyed the raw emotion of the events so well, I sobbed at several scenes. It was an intense, stunning cinematic experience and I have nothing but praise for Mr. Gibson, his direction, the players, the photographers.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2VUP5US1F5HG5	K. Jump	"How many times have you heard that, right?Well, this time it's true.""The Passion of the Christ"" is the kind of film the cinema itself was created for.  A faithful translation of Christ's arrest, torture, and execution drawn from the Gospels, Mel Gibson's labor of love and anguish drives home the pointed magnitude of the Lord's sacrifice like no other adaptation before.  For two hours the audience vicariously mourns and bleeds with the Messiah as He bears the unimaginable burden of mankind's sin to the grave and beyond.  The camera rarely flinches, and the only respite from the onscreen horror comes in a series of flashbacks highlighting such vital Gospel moments like the rescue of Mary Magdalene, the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper.  But this is not your typical cinematic mayhem; the violence in this movie is vital to the truth.  Gibson wanted to show people what the Lord really put himself through for us.  Yes, Jesus was the Son of God--but He was also a man, and the sufferings He endured for us were terrible indeed.  We are, truly, bought at a precious price.Stylistically, the movie never flags.  The performances are uniformly excellent (James Caviezel's valiant submission to his role as Christ is particularly stirring and heartfelt), the shot selection innovative (one shot in particular shows us what it might look like if God were to weep)and the tone reverent and somber, as it should be.Moreover, Gibson does not shy away from the reality of the spiritual warfare that we are all involved in whether we like it or not.  Evil lurks in the shadows, haunting, goading and tempting.  Christ refused to give in; so must we.Criticisms of this film are unfair and misplaced.  Of course it is a violent film; crucifixion is violent.  Yes, there is a lot of blood--but that blood is salvation for you and me. As for the issue of anti-Semitism, it hardly merits mention.  We are all guilty of Christ's blood, but yes there were Romans and Jews involved in His murder, even as there were Romans and Jews who followed and loved Him. Nothing would be served by trying to pretend otherwise.Comparisons to earlier adaptations of the life of Christ are inevitable but not necessarily appropriate.  Most of the other films cover not merely the Passion story but the whole of His birth, life,  ministry and resurrection.  This film focuses almost entirely on Christ's death.  For the whole story, a movie like the also excellent ""Jesus of Nazareth"" might be more appropriate, or perhaps the recent ""Gospel of John"" (which also looks outstanding, but this reviewer has not seen it yet).  But ""The Passion"" stands alone in portraying the awful power of Christ's sacrifice in all its terrible enormity.If there is one thing about the movie I would have liked to have seen handled a little differently, it is the Resurrection itself.  Though present, it is primarily an epilogue.  While uplifting and comforting, after all that has gone before a little more screen time for this event might have been justified.No, this is not light fare.  This is a movie that can make you cry, groan, and grieve.  It is not a fun movie.  It will challenge you and make you think.  Adult Christians (and perhaps mature teens)should see it to be inspired and reminded of what Christ endured for them.  Non-Christians should see it to better understand what Christianity is about and who Jesus really is. But for whatever reason, *see it*.  Not for Mel Gibson, not for any reviewer, and not because of the controversey.  See it because this is a movie that can change your life.  Period.Mel Gibson said something to the effect that he believes the Holy Spirit was at work in this movie.  After seeing it last night, for what will NOT be the only time, I'm hardly going to disagree.

It was a great film for all people and all religions to see, but it was interesting to see a major motion picture told from such a very Catholic perspective.  As for the violence, I thought it was accurate to the way things were and I have to say that this is the first time I have ever heard such an outcry from Hollywood or anywhere about violence in film.  I think it is worth seeing by everyone, though I would use discrection when allowing children to see it.

It's not about a good man who choose to die.  It's not about a group of men who suddenly decided one day to begin a new cult.  It's not a commentary on the ills of big government.It is, in simple terms, a mirror, a reflection of the consequences of taking home that pen for which your employer bought and paid, for every white lie told to ""save someone's feeling"", for the numerous times each day that we (and I do mean all of us) worship our cars, our bank accounts, or our social status.  Christ paid the price for all of us, for ALL our sins both great and small.  Every time we judge others based on apperance, disrespect our parents, use God's name as a term of filth, bury ourselves working seven days a week, envy our neighbors because of their belongings, and forget who placed this universe is such a way that our third rock from the sun would sustain life, we place another nail in His hands and pierce His side once again.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A111TATNFNSU3X	Knight Poet	This movie is a shamefully disgraceful, graphically violent example of everything that is wrong with a religion that tries to drown the teachings of Jesus in a bloody river of lies. Jesus revealed God as the Father of each human being and when once you grasp this idea of God as a true and loving Father, the ONLY concept which Jesus ever taught, you must forthwith, in all consistency, utterly abandon all those primitive notions about God as an offended monarch, a stern and all-powerful ruler whose chief delight is to detect his subjects in wrongdoing and to see that they are adequately punished unless some being almost equal to himself should volunteer to suffer for them, to die as a substitute and in their place. The whole idea of ransom and atonement is incompatible with the concept of God as it was taught and exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The infinite love of God is not secondary to anything in the divine nature. Even if God were the stern and legal monarch of a universe in which justice ruled supreme, He certainly would not be satisfied with the childish scheme of substituting an innocent sufferer for a guilty offender! The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive. What a travesty upon the infinite character of God, this teaching that His fatherly heart in all its austere coldness and hardness was so untouched by the misfortunes and sorrows of His creatures that His tender mercies were not forthcoming until He saw His blameless Son bleeding and dying upon the cross of Calvary! It is an insult to God to believe or teach that innocent blood must be shed in order to win His favor or to divert the fictitious divine wrath! These ancient errors and pagan superstitions about the Universal Father's nature represent a doomed philosophy destined for rejection by enlightened truth-seekers.	1.0	A Bloody River of Lies	2012-03-09	28	7	21

I mostly wanted to make a statement to Hollywood by going to that movie, and I wanted to support what Mel Gibson did.I am Protestant, and I know there was some controversy about whether or not Protestants should go.  I even got into a discussion about it via email with someone who didn't think we should.  Going only reenforced my belief that it transcends denominational boundaries.It is easy, especially with the picture portrails of the crucifixion, to get a prettied up picture of what happened in our minds.  Even if you've studied the physical effects of the crucifixion on the human enduring it (and I have), it is hard to see the crucifixion for what it truly was.  *The Passion* brings you face to face with that reality in a powerful way.I appreciated the flashbacks, especially those involving the things he said at the last supper.  Somehow, even those statements were more vivid in my mind once I saw the movie.I came away from the movie with my faith reenergized.  I had been reminded of what God called me to do and enthusiastically wanted to do so; after all, it is the least I could do, given all He did for me.  I want to recreate that, especially when I feel my walk with God needs a ""jump start.""  It was GREAT to see on the big screan, and if it is ever there again, I'd urge anyone and everyone to go.

There is little dialogue, and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting, as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting, but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not ""entertaining.""  Those who liked the old movies ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" and ""King of Kings""  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown), because it is the same story.  It is an intimate, in-your-face, almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie, I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."	5.0	The Crucifixion	2004-02-25	6	5	1

Jesus should not be treated in this horrible way of suffering, it was a disgrace to do to any life forms including animals. Beating should be outlawed. Just put Jesus in a straight jacket, that would make more sense, But those days everybody would be in one, if straight jackets existed back then just like insane asylums wasn't around either.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2IY49V4ARN4HC	K. Parry	"Although my husband and I do not affiliate ourselves with any organized religion, we were very curious to see ""The Passion,"" even to the point of seeing it opening weekend.  Living in a place where the Bible seems to be the only book than anyone reads, we knew we needed to see the film so we could formulate an opinion, and rather than just formulating it on word-of-mouth, we chose to see the movie immediately.  Plus, ""Braveheart"" is one of my all-time favorite films, so I knew that a film directed by Mel Gibson would be great, regardless of subject matter.Despite the fact that my Biblical understanding is sketchy at best, I found myself engrossed in this film.  The fact that Gibson chose to have the actors speak their lines in Aramaic and Latin was, to me, a very wise choice.  Several times I have seen previews of movies set in certain countries or certain times, and not only are people speaking English, they are speaking English with American accents, which detracts from the whole point of the film.  This sounds weird to say, but after a while I forgot I was reading subtitles.  And the two languages were beautiful.It's been several hours since I left the theater and I still feel extremely moved by the experience of watching ""The Passion.""  The fact that Jesus held onto his convictions until the bitter end, even through all of the horrible scourging and beating and crucifixion shows the extreme depth of his character.  Again, for a person who is very unfamiliar with the Bible, it was admirable to me to see that Jesus was honest about his identity and his abilities even though he knew it would send him to certain death.The cinematography of this film is beautiful, if graphic at many times.  But Gibson, who is no stranger to extreme violence in films (if anyone has seen ""Payback"" they know what I'm talking about), knows the exact times to give the audience an ""out;"" just as I thought I was seeing too much of this, and I wanted to just look away, he would insert a flashback to earlier times in Jesus' life, or he would focus back on Mary & Mary Magdalene and their suffering in watching Jesus' ordeal.Some people have addressed the extreme violence in this movie, intimating that it is excessive.  Well,  considering the brutality of the Roman Empire,  I would not be entirely surprised if the actual event had been more horrendous.  We most likely were still watching a sanitized version of the event, although this was more graphic than any other previous depiction.My only complaint about ""The Passion"" is the fact that Gibson seems to assume that everyone watching the movie is familiar with the story; he seems to feel that no real explanation of what's going on is necessary.  Some may argue that to go into all this detail would involve making a four-hour film, but I do not agree.  All it would have really involved was maybe extending some of the flashback scenes: explain why Judas was in such a financial crunch that he was willing to sell Jesus' location for a mere 30 coins.  Explain why Mary Magdalene was being stoned.  Show a little bit more of the conflict that I understand Jesus went through before his capture- this was eluded to in his prayer scene in Gethsemane with Satan, but a little more background would have been helpful.  Even if Gibson planned this purely as a vehicle to get more people to read the Bible and go to church, he should have addressed these matters just to make a more complete film.Having said that, I still feel that this movie is something every adult should  experience, regardless of religious affiliation.  Whether you believe in God or not, or whether you believe that Jesus was truly God's son or not,  whether you believe that Jesus died for man's sins or not,  the fact remains that Jesus DID exist, Jesus DID die this horrible, horrible death for his beliefs and his preachings,  and we SHOULD learn something from this, even though many of us do not.  Jesus died because people couldn't handle his message; he rocked  the boat a little too much for the establishment's comfort.  Although most of the world seems to think that they are upholding Jesus through their religious beliefs, the fact remains that people are still being persecuted (although most of the time not nearly as violently) for having different beliefs.  That is, if anything is, the true sin.As a very important note: do NOT take children to see this movie.  Regardless of your or your family's religious affiliation this would be an EXTREMELY traumatic film for children to see.  I know people out there are saying that there is much more violence in films right now, but this is violence on a very different  level; most of the guns and sword-fighting variety of violence in films now are very sanitized compared to ""The Passion."" Nothing is left to the imagination: a cat-o-nine-tails sticks in Jesus' flesh at one point, and violently rips off his flesh, exposing ribs, and the viewer sees all of this.  Even Mel Gibson said that this is not a kid's movie; and to be perfectly honest I think the MPAA should have rated the film NC-17.  Copious amounts of blood are shed from this one poor individual,  and children absolutely SHOULD NOT see this until they are AT LEAST 15 or 16!  Please, if you choose to teach your children religion, teach it through church/synagogue/temple or through reading or prayer, NOT through this film."	5.0	Excellent, moving film-review from a non-religious reviewer	2004-02-28	13	10	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1KEKYQV2G8D4R	"K. Pemberton ""cherith"""	I saw this movie twice in the theatres.  The first time truly was an assault to the senses and the graphic violence certainly there.  This movie seemed to grasp the intensity of the crucifixion. With the hype surrounding the movie, it was clear (pretty much to everyone breathing) this movie was going to be violent.However, I knew how the ending would turn out.  I was more interested in watching how Jesus' attitude was towards those involved in the entire crucifixion - Romans and Jews.  As I watched his face, I didn't see anger - but more like love.  Jesus was crucified prove God's love and save those who were doing the killing.The second time I watched it was the Saturday before Easter Sunday.  I would encourage everyone to watch it at that time.  Walking into the Easter Service the next day I wondered why people weren't jumping up and down with joy.  Easter has always been a joy, but this movie helped to illustrate the point.	5.0	A sobering realization of what happened in history!	2004-10-04	8	4	4

We recieved it for christmas from the kids, who said it was a great movie. It is. I believe that Mr. Gibson was attempting to make a historical movie, not so much a religious one. Jesus was never a threat to the Roman Empire, and there is a question as to whether Ceasar even knew who he was. Pilate, who over the last couple centuries has been the villain in this sad tale, was actually a poor schmuck caught in an impossible political situation, with his head literally on the line if he made the wrong choice. I cannot condemn the Jewish heirarchy for their fears either, they saw more and more of their followers beginning to leave their faith and embrace this new ""Messiah's"" teachings, some of which did not comply with their accepted codes. Very scary in those days. If what Jesus said is true, then this all had to happen...one way or another..so no one could have prevented it.As to the blood and gore.....well not many people fully realized what scourging was until it was depicted in this film. Now they do. It was a horrifying and ugly punishment, and many people died from even a moderate scourging, but it was a common practice in those times. Very few people went to prison in those days, except to await sentencing, your punishment was meted out physically or you were put to death. Believe me, if you do study history, you'll find much worse punishments than scourging and crucifixon. Check out Asia for inovative tortures and ugly death.I thought the film did a great job developing characters, and trying to truly capture the events that happend so long ago. As to Mr. Gibson reaping the ""gold"", well he earned it. He spent his own money to make this film, wouldn't compromise on the quality of any part of it, went to great lengths to make it historically accurate and has endured a great deal of abuse for it. If you are a hysterical, bible thumping, religious fanatic of any genre, you will probably hate this movie. Doesn't quite fit the ""accepted"" version.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A30NVLUJK05PD3	"K. Rim ""krimson"""	My review will probably be biased since I'm a Christian... BUT..The film is indeed very graphic and bloody but I don't think it is just meaningless gratutious violence.  The reason you are moved so much in many scenes is because of the raw violence.  This man suffered so much pain willingly.  It's hard to believe anyone could take so much punishment and would do so of his own free will.Some people have complained about inacuracies in the film.  First like any film maker Gibson is bound to take some artistic licenses but overall the story is *extremely* consistant with the scriptures in the gospels.  And as for some of the other points, Gibson said he consulted with several experts who themselves could not agree on some of the finer points, so he naturally took what made the most sense to him in the film.Gibson did not intend to make a completely accurate documentary about the life of Jesus.  He wanted to tell a powerful story that would cause anyone to reflect about who Jesus was and why he had to suffer.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough spent on WHY Jesus suffered instead of WHAT Jesus went through.  You almost had to already know the story to understand what was happening in all the scenes.  But again I think Gibson's purpose was to affect you as a filmmaker to plant an interest in the viewer to question.From a cinematic point of the view the movie had a fine ensemble of actors and a well made beautiful movie.  However since I'm already very familiar with the story there was just no suspense and you just wish that the suffering of Jesus would end.  But it did inspire me to go back to my bible and reread all the accounts of the Gospels and reflect.  Just for that I think Gibson has accomplished his goal.	3.0	Good film taken in context	2004-02-25	3	1	2

The movie focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus' (Jim Caviezel) life leading up to his death and resurrection. This movie has some very graphic scenes, but don't let the violence concern you. It is a powerful depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, thanks in part to its director, the brilliant Mel Gibson, who directed and starred as Justin Mcleod in ""The Man Without A Face"" and William Wallace in ""Braveheart"", the latter, which won him the Best Director Oscar. He also well known as Dr. Gibbon in ""The Singing Detective"" (2003), Graham Hess in ""Signs"" (2002), Lt. Col.

His directing in this movie is brilliant without compromise. Everything he did to make this movie has paid off brilliantly. The cast including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother, are brilliant as well. Caviezel's performance as Jesus, is emotionally powerful and brilliant and as the co-anchor of the movie, besides, Gibson, does a brilliant job as much as Gibson did. Gibson's production company, Icon Productions, has produced movies of his such as, ""The Singing Detective"" (2003), ""Payback"" (1999), ""What Women Want"" (2000), ""Braveheart"" (1995), ""We Were Soldiers"" (2002), ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"" (1997), ""Forever Young"" (1992), ""Hamlet"" (1990), ""The Man Without A Face"" (1993), and ""Maverick"" (1994).

The production design by Francesco Frigeri and the costume design by Maurizio Millenotti is brilliant. The casting by Shaila Rubin is brilliant. The set direction by Carlo Gervasi is brilliant. The visual and make-up effects by Greg Cannom and Keith Vanderlaan is brilliant. This movie make a powerful point about how Jesus died and the point is brilliant and succeeds on every level. The language, which is in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, which is shown in English subtitles, proves that you don't need to speak English to have a brilliant film with heart and soul.

""The Passion of the Christ"" is one of the best portrayals of Christ's final days ever.He has accurately transfered the story in the four gospels and added his own imagination into the mix.Some of the movie's critics will tell you that since Mel Gibson has added his own color in the story that the movie is unfaithful to the Gospels. This is crazy. Nowhere does Mel's additions controdict the Bible, so therefore the movie is accurate.This movie shows, I'm sure, just a glimpse of what Christ went through to save us from our sins. Though carrying our sins, I would say that he went through much more pain than the movie portrays.This movie is inspirational, and after I saw it, I told myself never to take for granted what Christ did for me.Many critics of this movie that I heard try to paint this movie has having a terrible affect on its viewers.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2460ZRFVC2YGV	Kristopher Haines	"""The Passion of the Christ"" is a searing film. To call it ""unflinching"" would be such a gross understatement as to be insulting. I had no idea of the level of disparity between critical reactions to the film. I knew of the controversy about its supposedly anti-Semitic content, but I thought for sure that even those who may have disagreed with its version of events or level of violence could at the very least stand in absolute awe of its artistry. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is an exquisitely constructed masterpiece. Everything, from it's chilling score to its haunting cinematography (which manages to imbue equal amounts of dread in a gloomy garden in the dead of night as into a city in broad daylight)all work in pursuit of a common goal: to tell the story of Christ's suffering in fittingly horrific detail. It is a` brutally gorgeous success.Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I must say (with a measure of shame) that I am woefully religiously ignorant. I only know the basic plot points of the story and there were more than a few characters with whom I was totally unfamiliar. So, regretfully I must agree with those who criticize Gibson for not telling the whole story. ""They"" say it because they disagree with Gibson's whole-hearted focus on Jesus' unimaginably violent end without expounding upon the extraordinary life that was extinguished. I say it because I am confident that Gibson could tell that part of the story with an equal amount of grace. So here is my humble challenge to Mr. Gibson: do it! Answer your critics with a breath-taking prequel. With Gibson as our guide religion is riveting."	4.0	Absolutely Stunning. A beautiful gut-wrenching epic.	2005-10-22	11	6	5

John 3:16-17 New International Version (NIV)Jesus died on the cross for the sins of the world.  His resurrection on the third day shows that his sacrifice was the propitiation (satisfaction) of God's righteous judgment.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AC06F0LPHI1TW	K Scheffler	It is quite dismaying to see all the emotionally wrought hype that has surrounded the movie, as it has clouded so many minds from seeing the truth.  This movie is propaganda, a sad distortion of the truth at the hands of a devotee of the Hollywood Blockbuster Cult.  The Passion of the Christ is filled with inaccuracies, all of which have been brought to light, but conveniently been ignored my the yearning masses.  Gibson said that he was forced to resort to his own interpretation when the academics he consulted provided him with contradictory information.  That's possible.  Academics have their own interpretations, and these interpretations are the matter of considerable debate within the academic field.  But there are a number of issues where there is some consensus, and had Gibson been truly desirous of producing an accurate film, he would NOT have given up so easy and resorted to his own unqualified interpretations.  But the truth is, he was more interested in making a Biblical Braveheart, a movie that appeals more to the sentiments of the general movie goer at the expense of their historical ignorance.  Moreover, there is his Traditionalist Catholic agenda--don't tell me that in no way was this movie made in order to draw attention to this sect...	1.0	The Perversion of the Truth	2004-02-29	38	15	23

I'm not gonna write a review(tons have already done that, see this movie it is good) I just wanted to comment on a few people who are saying this is anti-semetic.How is this anti-semetic?  Yes, GASP it shows Jews cruxifying Jesus, thats what really happened.  It also shows the Romans part in it all too.  So what should we do now, well lets never mention the Holocaust(it would be against Germans) and lets never mention slavery(its against whites) and lets never mention the World Trade Center attacks because it will be against Muslims!  Not all Jews cruxified Jesus, not all Muslims flew the planes into the World Trade Center, not all whites were slave owners during the far gone centuries, not all Germans were nazas!  This movie is not anti-semetic, it is being made that by people who are against the Christian faith.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AI7NDB9TUTNM0	"K. Vrabac ""Denis"""	It is more than obvious that a story about the last 12 hours of Jesus' life cannot be as it was exactly, this goes with any movie based on a true story. We do know that Jesus of Nazareth existed and that his suffered extraordinary pain. If you are going to debate how he walked, or how he fell, or how he was put on the cross, please go watch something else. This is obviously not a movie where Mel Gibson hopped in his delorean and went to record the actual thing. This is only to give you a simple point: Christ suffered.If you can deal with the truth that he did suffer, and that he felt pain, you should consider viewing this movie. Other stories told on television show a blonde man with blue eyes talking calmly on the cross.. Give me a break. The Passion Of The Christ shows a person who suffered extremely, and did not consider the situation enjoyable. Anyone with an understanding of what happened will understand the point of the movie, and will not debate un-necessary things that appear in the movie: Like who was sitting next to who, and why he wasn't pierced through his wrist, etc. No one is certain how he was put on the cross, so please shut up and don't make assumptions that no one knows.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A329ALHKYK62O7	Ky. Col.	"Artistically, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a masterpiece.  It combines fine acting, good cinematography, truely disturbing though not pointless imagery, and even a couple of ancient languages (Latin and Aramaic).  It also got a lot of Christians thinking more about their Lord's sufferings.  On the whole these were the good parts and I recommend the film though it is suitable only for mature audiences.The film is not perfect historically and I think it may have some theological weaknesses as well.  For instance, Greek should have been employed in the film and Christ was likely nailed to a Tau cross (T) rather than a Latin cross (t).  Dr. Zugibe does a nice but short critique of the film in his book ""The Crucifixion of Jesus: Second Edition.""  Theologically, I think this film may make Christians look too much at Christ's physical sufferings.  After all, crucifixion is often considered one of the worst forms of execution but there are others likely as bad or worse.  Even regarding crucifixion, many men, women, and children have sadly died on crosses.  What made Christ's sufferings unique was the spiritual atoning angle, not purely physical pain.  That said, that may be imposible to capture well in a film so I should perhaps let Gibson off the hook there.  Overall, a well-made film that is not anti-semetic though it is not a film for all viewers."	4.0	Artistically Brilliant though Not Always Accurate	2007-11-09	2	0	2

Some people are bound to hate it for the violence of it, some will be put off by the fact that the film is totally subtitled. And some will not like it because Mr. Gibson is accused of being an Anti-Semite.  And most of those people will not have even seen the film.  Which is a shame...I'd heard all the hype, read some of what some critics had to say and then I did what some people on line and off line who have been chatting about this film refuse to do.  I went out and saw it for myself.  According to some critics this film is anti-Semitic, according to some it is too violent, in that the depiction of Christ's torture is too graphic.On the former: being anti-Semitic.  I didn't get that feeling from the film, nor I dare say did the people who surrounded me in the theater.  The film was about a small group of priests trying to protect their power base which Jesus and his teachings threatened.  It is clearly shown in the film that during the trial anyone who stood up for Jesus including some of the other priests (who were also Jewish) where ejected from the proceedings.  And there are several scenes in which there are crowds of people weeping for Jesus(also Jewish).  There is a scene in which Veronica (also Jewish) comes to wipe the face of Jesus and is knocked way by Roman soldiers.  The film also makes a point of having Jesus say that no man takes his life but that he willingly lays it down.  I think for this film to stir feelings of anti-Semitism one would have had to walked into the film an anti-Semite.  And that to me has nothing to do with the film, and everything to do with a personal decision made long before this film was even a conception in come cases.The point is that if you're a Christian than the film is saying that we all are responsible for the death of Christ in that it was our sin that made it necessary for God to require a sacrifice, and for the sacrifice to be made. The film is a tool in which we are shown that Christ's death wasn't this antiseptic death, where he was hit once or twice, whipped and then nailed to the cross where he just died.  This films is showing us that he was beaten, and the whip they used had nails and bone, and glass in it, which is historically correct when it comes to devices that the Romans used in ""chastising"" prisoners. This kind of beating was meant to destroy the body, it was meant as a form of torture in itself. Which leads me to.....The latter: the graphic violence.  Well I really don't understand some people's objection in that there are movies out there with more gratuitous violence.  And the violence has been mindless and played for thrills, or to see just how much the director can gross the audience out, because they certainly have gotten past the point of actually trying to scare people anymore.  There are video games that advocate shooting people and stealing their cars.  Television is a wash with show after show depicting death in the most violent of ways. There are shows that show us the path of a bullet as it enters the body, shows that show us bones breaking on the impact of a blunt object.  We're fed a steady diet of these violent acts that seem to have no value to it other than to shock us, or to draw us in to make us watch.In this film however the violence isn't there to gross us out, or for shock value.  But it's there as a reminder of the sacrifice made by an innocent for the sins of all men.  The violence in this film is there to depict the level of love that Christ had for us in going to the cross.  It's about showing that we as a race and not just differing ethic groups are capable of this level of violence and so incredibly much more.  That we as a race of people can look back over our vast history and see it has been peppered with individual and societal acts of violence that make what we see in this film pale in comparison. And yet for all of our ungratefulness Christ came here and willingly went to the cross knowing well in advance what would be done to him.  Which is why in the garden at the very beginning of the film Jesus asks that if it be God's well to let this bitter cup pass from him.  It has to be a horrifying thing to not only know that you're going to die, but to know in detail the manner in which you are going to die.  And to know you are suffering and dying an innocent man. Not only that but to know that your most trusted friends are to betray you and deny ever knowing you.I've done my research on the subject of crucifixion.  And it wasn't a sanitary from of death, it was torture.  It was done because it was one of the most painful ways to die, and people got to watch your agony.  The point was to make you suffer, and to draw that suffering out over a long period of time.  The only reason to break the legs of a convicted criminal was to make death faster, because the weight of your body would finally suffocate you.So yes the violence of the beating, and the violence of the crucifixion was indeed very graphic.  But then what the Romans did when beating criminals and crucifying people was very graphic. And shouldn't be sanitized because some people don't like it.When I saw this film there were a lot of tears not only mine but there wasn't a dry eye in the theater. Not one.And that alone should tell you the powerful impact the film has.If nothing else The Passion of the Christ has sparked conversation.  Where that conversation leads is up to us."	5.0	Hallelujah Anyhow!!!!!!!	2004-05-30	8	7	1

I must admit that it was very graphic in details, but in a good way. I know it might sound cheesy, but I was just really touched by this movie. I  literally cried like a baby from beginning to end just watching it. I was so overwhelmed by the gory images and unrelentless torture that I have a new respect and admiration for what this man actually went through for our sins, and in my own humble opinion, it takes a very heartless and cold person not to at least be touched or feel his pain in some kind of way. In my own experience, I must say that watching this movie was the best thing I've done in a long time (and the realest movie ever made) because it's really changed my beliefs in so many ways I wouldn't have ever imagined.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AAYTY8ACWLWKE	Laitinen Sami	I must admit that seeing Passion of the Christ at the movies was a very unique experience. In many ways, this movie was very masterfully made. It must have taken enormous efforts to create the setting and make it all run smoothly together in Aramaic.Aside this, I was somewhat disappointed that the movie focused on Jesus' suffering and the last moments through extended and very violent scenes. It was too sadistic for my taste and I found myself feeling uneasy about it. Why the director didn't give more attention to Jesus' true message? I feel that he could have reached even wider audience and level of appreciation if the movie would have embraced further different aspects of Jesus' life.Naturally, as a mystic, I view the message of the Bible in a different light than mainstream Christians. So I am always looking for some symbolical and spiritual message within the pages of the Bible -- so I tried to found it in this movie, but it proved to be very difficult.The director also took the liberty of changing the message of Bible by adding things that do not exist in our version of the Bible. I also feel there to exist some Catholic tone to this movie which is the reason why I decreased my evaluation with one star. Another star is taken away for excessive focus on torturing Jesus rather than portraying more of his work. Few occasional flashbacks are not sufficient to please a viewer who is looking for something deeper in the movie. Otherwise this movie is quite an experience to see.However, in spite of my personal opinions, I am sure that the movie will provide a wonderful experience to anyone who sees it.We may end up interpretting its message in different lights, according to our beliefs...but one thing that we all can agree with is that it is a masterfully produced and took enormous efforts from the production team. It is like part of common knowledge to see this.	3.0	Amazing Project, but where are we heading to?	2004-07-27	0	0	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1004AX2J2HXGL	Lao Che	"I cried when I saw The PASSION OF THE CHRIST - how could you not? I sat there and watched a man brutalized for two hours. Everyone around me was crying - it felt like we were all tuned in to the proceedings of a televised execution.  I was a little confused by the time it was all over & as I was leaving the theater, I was even more so: I saw parents walking out with their children.  Jesus Christ's teachings were left in the wings, the significance of his life locked out of the script almost entirely.  Hardly a first impression for young children.  The ONLY things I found at all interesting about the PASSION OF THE CHRIST: the use of the authentic languages from the time period (Latin & Aramaic) and the actors bringing this movie to life.  James Caviezel's performance in Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE was simply mesmerizing, and he used a similar pallet of emotion for his performance here.  I was raised a Roman Catholic - so viewing the Stations of the Cross was nothing new to me.  To suggest this film version of that seasonal meditation is a ""masterwork"" - simply is absurd.So what WAS the point of this film, what were we to draw from its brutal imagery?  There was no inspiration in Mel Gibson's film for me, no arc of understanding - only suffering and death.  Which led me to consider their goal may have been to create a vivid emotional experience, intended to lift us out of numbness and inspire reflection on faith to get us through this life: televised warfare, beheadings on the internet, stories of sickness and shootings on the nightly news, etc.  Perhaps, but I don't think so.  A fleeting, knee-jerk reaction with some tears shed on queue, and then those emotions are safely placed back on the shelf until the next time.  Complicity and silence have always gone hand in hand: it's easy to damn this world, condemn what we see as different from our own huddled beliefs; allow selfishness and insincerity to decimate through clouds of frankincense and joyous hymns.  Salvation?  Maybe.The infamous THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a ""masterwork"" of filmmaking. The film not only inspires the heart, but also prods the mind.  I could feel the breath of those images, allowing me to enter the world it created and truly feel something more than myself.  It was not an epiphany; it was a fresh view, it was an enlightened dream of another world, yet strangely our own.  The film didn't plague the audience with blood and horrors; it dramatizes the passion and relevance of the story.  I've come to understand and believe Jesus Christ to be among the greatest teachers this world has known, who suffered the tortures of the damned to inspire his vision of peace, determination for truth and humility in us all - ideals that have taken a back seat to robotic, indignant servitude to skewed ""moral"" interests.The LAST TEMPTATION was based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis - from which the filmmakers created a thoughtful, passionate re-examination of one of the greatest stories ever told.  Mr. Scorsese, in his youth, had almost joined the priesthood; but chose to explore and express his passion through the cinema.  I saw no blasphemy in his images - only a powerful film exploring faith in ourselves and the world.  Often cited as trash, garbage and against popular faith - this film truly offers a story of FAITH we can all profit from, regardless of what we believe."	1.0	"""Life beyond the thunderdome"""	2005-01-17	35	16	19

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ	Larry Scantlebury	"The complexity of the last hours of Christ's life has haunted spiritualists, theologins, Christians, Jews and Muslims for centuries. It is the mystery upon which the Christian religeon is founded. Christ was divine but simultaneously, human. So he was 'the way' but he also knew what was in store for him. The references to 'the new covenant' at the Last Supper . . . if you don't know about the prior covenants at Mount Sinai, or the Davidic Covenant (""From your loins shall spring Kings"") of thousands of years earlier, you can't see the forest for the trees that Christ and the Old Testament come together as one story.So what is the mystery is that he was Divine, knew what was going to happen, and as a human, really wanted to avoid it. And, even more difficult to grasp, he was there to die for our sins. Our present sins. Our past sins. Our future sins. This is not an aberrant thought. It had been going on since the time of the the captivity in Egypt. Jesus says to the High Priest in the first interrogation in response to the question 'who are you?' he says I AM. This is what he tells Moses thousands of years earlier. I AM.So what Gibson is doing is to show people that Christ knew he was going to suffer, and that his suffering was human and extraordinarily agonizing.It's hard to rate in the conventional sense. Is it a great movie? Perhaps the greatest. Will you want to see it again? Probably not. Should Gibson be given accolades? Most certainly. But I would rather shake his hand as a man of faith then of a movie director. Somehow I feel he would agree. Larry Scantlebury"	5.0	If you don't get it, this film won't help	2004-09-07	13	6	7

The Passion of the Christ made me feel like I had actually witnessed the crucifixion, and what led up to it.  I feel the violence in it is necessary for us to feel the depth of emotion experienced by those people who witnessed the crucifixion.  I can only imagine the sorrow of Jesus' mother and those who knew him well, as they witnessed the series of events leading to his death.  This is a movie to touch the heart of anyone.  A macho young man sitting next to me in the theater, eating his nachos and making jokes about the movie previews, was in tears along with the rest of us at certain points in the movie.  I would highly recommend this movie not only for its Gospel truth, but also for its artistic quality.  This is a movie made on a grand scale, like the opera Aida, but for the movie theater.  The scenery, superb acting (James Caviezel was wonderful as Jesus)and ""cast of thousands"" scenes make this movie a masterpiece.  Mel Gibson has touched many hearts and minds with this movie, and I am proud of him for putting the truth out there."	5.0	A Movie that Touches the Heart	2004-03-05	4	2	2

It was nothing more than a long winded film of the good old ""Ultra Violence"". Yes, it was anti-Semitic, or biblically accurate whatever suits your religion, whether you're a Jew or a Christian or if you're into that sort of thing. I viewed the movie for its face value which was nothing more than a mere long video of Jesus getting his A** kicked, which was not only unrealistic because the frail actor that they chose for the movie would have collapsed within the first thirty minutes of the brutal beating he was receiving. The most interesting character in the film was Satan who was portrayed by Rosalinda Celentano who just kept lurking around in the background with those eerie androgynous looks. However with all the hype about this movie, it is a must see, and that's why I waited until it was in the video stores because I already knew what to expect."	3.0	A Bit of the Old Ultra Violence	2004-12-11	14	6	8

I walked out of the theater without a word. Very reverent, very silent. No one spoke leaving the theater. None of my group spoke the whole way home. Not a word, not a tear. I did hear many tears behind me though. The movie is moving and difficult, yet important. It forces you to react.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	There is a well-known Christian song that asks &quot;Were you there when they crucified my Lord?&quot;  What that meant has never been as graphically displayed in a film before as in Mel Gibson's &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot;  The scouring of Jesus is pivotal part of this film and its emphasis is justified by the fact that Jesus only lasted a few hours on the cross.  Victims of crucifixion usually lasted days, able to gain brief respite from the physical agony by pushing themselves upwards, which causes create pain in the feet, where nails have been driven through the arches.  This is why breaking the legs of the thieves would hasten their deaths: hanging by their arms their pectoral muscles would become paralyzed and eventually the lung and heart stop working well enough to continue.  Hanging by his arms, the pectoral muscles are paralyzed and the intercostal muscles are unable to act.  If Jesus only lasted a few hours on the cross, then he must have been badly beaten, a point that will be seared into the mind of every viewer who watches &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot;The most serious concern I have with this film is that on a couple of points Gibson decides to veer away from his commitment to providing the most accurate depiction of these events ever seen to fall back on tradition.  Although the two thieves are correctly show carrying only their cross-arms (the patibulum, which weighed about 100 pounds) through the streets of Jerusalem, Jesus once again has to carry the entire cross.  Then when Jesus is nailed to the cross the nails are place in the palm of his hands instead of through the natural opening made by the small bones of the wrists (radial and ulna).  One of the reasons the Shroud of Turin is considered an accurate depiction of a crucified Jesus is that the nail wounds are in the proper place.  Given the violence of putting the cross into position, the hands would have been ripped right through the palms of the hand.  I suspect the reason for this deviation is that Gibson was brought up with such images, codified by most depictions of the crucified Christ and the Stations of the Cross (twelve of the fourteen traditional Station are depicted: omitted are Jesus meeting the women of Jerusalem and his burial).I certainly do not consider &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; to be anti-Semitic, mainly because both of the races depicted in the film are shown as having &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; members.  Granted, only the motivation for the actions of Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) are explored; Caiphas (Mattia Sbragia) and Judas (Luca Lionello) both play out their parts without any clear reason why they are playing the parts they play.  A better case can be made that the Roman soldiers were probably not as cruel and stupid as they were shown here (they should have realized sooner to back off on the whipping or they were going to kill Jesus before they had the chance to nail him to a cross).  Yet all of these choices are certainly within the scope of the story related in the Gospels.Gibson's Catholicism seems to come through more in his portrayal of the Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Maia Morgenstern provides what for me were the two most emotionally compelling moments in the film.  The first is when Jesus rises to his feet after the first whipping session when mother and son exchange a look of understanding.  The second is when Mary sees her son fall on his way to Golgatha and has a flashback.  Along with another flashback of Jesus and Mary, when he was still only a carpenter, &quot;The Passion&quot; presents the most realized version of the Virgin Mary we have ever seen.The other part of the film that really stood out for me because it was equally unexpected given the film's focus on the Passion, was James Caviezel's portryal of Jesus in a series of brief flashbacks.  I liked seeing a compassionate and charismatic Jesus doing part of the Sermon on the Mount, as well as one who could laugh with his mother over his latest project as a carpenter.  The emphasis in this film is on the realism of the Passion and the crucifixion, but I can make a case that this realism extends to the brief depictions of Jesus' life and ministry as well.Gibson takes license with the story recorded in the Gospels in several ways, with mixed results.  I like the silent flashback to one of my favorite stories of Jesus ministry (John 8:7), although once again it is tradition rather than historical or scriptural evidence that makes the adulteress to be Mary Magdalene.  The use of Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) was overdone to no great effect, but the one part that I would strongly argue went too far was the bit with the black bird during the crucifixion simply because I do not buy that God would engage in such a petty act at that time.  However I found what Judas was doing to himself between the betrayal and his suicide to be an effective addition.  I also see a bit of the medieval drama &quot;The York Crucifixion&quot; in the scene where a Roman has to get Jesus' second arm into position to be nailed to the cross, adding another inspirational source for this script by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald.Gibson's masterful publicity campaign for &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; resulted in more pre-ticket sales than any other film in history.  But the success the film now enjoys is because of what is on the screen and not what was in the media.  This is a provocative film, because in addition to demanding a gut reaction to the violence depicted on the screen it compels the audience to engage mentally as well.	5.0	&quot;See, mother, I make all things new...&quot;	2004-03-07	20	14	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3K4ZQ9AOOSBVM	L.C.	I just saw this movie with one of my younger sisters for Easter, and we were both very moved by it. It is definitely a realistic portrayl of what Jesus had to go through for us. Watching this movie, in a way, has brought me closer to Jesus, and it really left an impact on me. It's a very heavy movie, however, and very difficult to watch. I don't like to see people getting hurt, so seeing Jesus get hurt was especially hard for me. But it really shows you how much Jesus loves and cares for us all by taking the burden of sin for us. I think this is a movie everyone should see because it is a real reminder of the wonderful love Jesus has for all of us. The movie was all in Hebrew, too, with subtitles, so it was very realistic and quite faithful to the Gospels. Mel Geibson did a wonderful job sharing with us a very realistic glimpse of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus.	5.0	A Very Moving Account of Jesus' final 12 hours.	2005-03-27	16	11	5

However, it is very curious to me that no one has yet spoken about the sign above Jesus on the cross.  ""King of the worms.""  Not one discussion about this movie has acknowledged what this signs means or insinuates.  And the fact that the sign is not factual nor based on the Bible (as claimed by the producers that the movie in its entirety is), reinforces the question of the sign's meaning.  Regardless of what individuals' religious beliefs are, it is not for anyone's ""higher good,"" benefit, nor is it loving, to rehash past wrongdoings. If anyone can possibly be persuaded to believe in Jesus as our Savior, the best possible persuasian is by witnessing actions that match words.  Walk our talk. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Stirring up animosity, blame, and trying to present a sense of superiority of one group of people to another... is not what I understand the Bible to teach.  Unfortunately, this movie seems to lean that way.  The focus should be on Jesus' purpose and teachings... not who killed who....  And further, the purpose of Jesus' death (if you should believe in the Bible as prophecy) is that it was prophecy.  God planned this... God used the Romans and Jews and whomever else was there at the time to participate....  God used the people to crucify Jesus.  The point isn't who did it and that they should be blamed... the point is that God wanted it to happen...  The whole intent of this movie seems to ignore Jesus' whole demeanor and desires for the human race."	3.0	artistically superb; intentions unsure	2004-09-13	7	2	5

When Mel started work on this film, he ponied up his own money. He didn't even have a distributor for the film, but he went on with the production. He filmed a movie in two dead languages. He has spent another $10 million of his own money to build a church building in his hometown. His actions show him to be a devout man.If he were only concerned with profit he could have churned out another Lethal Weapon movie.

The movie was not called &#34;The Resurrection of Christ&#34; but instead &#34;The Passion&#34;--the resurrection is for a different story. I'm sorry if you find me to be a heretic, but the movie was one of the heaviest, saddest, and most poignant emotional experiences until that ending--to me, it felt like Gibson tacked on a 'happy' ending for the sake of frightened audiences. I know how die-hard Christians feel about that ending, but to me it just seemed to undermine Christ's suffering (I'm speaking in terms of the movie guys). But other than these quibbles, I thought the movie was very moving, very violent (not nearly as bad as critics like Roger Ebert made it out to be--it's about suffering, geez), and very deeply felt. At first I was skeptical of Gibson's take on this material, but I'm glad that I watched it. I was very impressed with his style. J. C.'s performance as J. C. was absolutely stunning, and the guy was struck down by lightning on the set for Christ's sake! He is a wonderfully endearing actor. This movie kicked up a big stink at the time of its release, but soon it will continue to fall away to the dustbin of history when the spiritual orgasms over its violence have subsided. I didn't feel guilt at the end, but rather a deep and forbidding sorrow--this is a really sad movie, and I like it for that reason. Even nonbelievers will be touched, if only they will put aside their prejudices long enough to watch it. I did, and I enjoyed it--if enjoy is the right word for this kind of controversial, &#34;be careful what you say about it&#34; movie.The BluRay set is fantastic. There are some fascinating historical documentaries that are just as reverent and respectful as the tone of the film is. A lot of good footage here, featuring Gibson's thoughts, J. C.'s, and others who were brave enough to work on the film. I loved the presentation. The picture itself is very good, widescreen, and very effective in appearance.You may not agree with Gibson about his personal interpretations about the subject of Jesus all the time. But that's not the point in liking this film--for everything I thought was wrong with the film, Gibson has at least managed to present Jesus as a thoroughly ascetic hero, which goes a long way towards redemption for me, because today's family-oriented Christians want nothing to do with the pure ascetic life.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A16731GS4JK4CU	Lester Leonardo	I'm not going to state my bias or preferences on religion doctrine; the only thing I am going to write is my opinion on the movie itself.  In a nutshell the movie is about a man who willingly summits himself to be punished for the deeds of others, in the process he claims to be God in human flesh.  That's basically it, if you believe it or not, well that is a discussion left for another website.The movie gives you an account on how this man is punished and how he dies.  The images are hunting and the music is breathtaking.  It's obvious that the film was a labor of love for the director; it's something you can see by the amount of detail and the message he tries to convey thorough out the movie.  It is very disturbing and at the same time it has such an affect that it forces you to have some sort of reaction (positive or negative).  Similarly to a work of art it emphasizes what the artist sees and magnifies it so the audience can grasp it too.  In a few words, it's brilliant.	5.0	Gibson's Passion	2004-09-22	8	6	2

In fact any child would want to run to their loving parents with a tearful embrace asking their forgiveness in taking them for granted.

While many depictions of Christ show different aspects of his life, some concentrating on the early years and some focusing on the preaching or the miracles, this movie takes a very specific part and plays it out. The actual beating and torture are filmed in real time. So for people feeling like the amount of lashes were overdone or that there were no other aspects of Jesus's life are not living the actual journey of feeling what Jesus endured. To pace the movie like you were witnessing the torture is a unique approach to a movie. If this were the first or only movie ever produce on the life of Christ, fine. But it is not. I think what Mel Gibson was trying to achieve was to give the viewer a journey into living the moments up to the crucifiction If you were a bystander back on that particular day, than this is probably what you would have witnessed and felt. To tell the story any other way would not have achieved this goal. If you are looking for other dimensions to Christ's life, then buy Jesus of Nazerath or some other production. I for one felt compelled to watch every moment of the torture to appreciate what a human being, the son of God or not, endured for his beliefs. Like Shindlers list or video from 9/11, watching this is like paying tribute to those who suffered and died. It is not the kind of movie you would want to watch over and over. Or maybe more than once. And whether you or religious or atheist, you are just watching an account of an event that happened in history. Based on the movies objective, I give it 5 stars for cinematography, wardrobe, special effects etc. I really is a powerful production.	5.0	torture in real time	2011-09-20	6	3	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	Clearly, this is the most brutal film I have ever seen.  And, frankly, if the subject matter was not such a hallowed one, it is doubtful that Hollywood would have ever let it be made.  Mel Gibson has created this epic, depicting the last 12 hours of Christ's life on earth, as an act of faith.  Whether or not it is true to the gospels is for biblical scholars to decide. I'm just a film buff, and a Jewish one at that, who was anxious to see the film because of all the buzz.O.K.  Acting and cinematography and marketing were all done well.  But this film is more than about those things.  It's about the central idea of the Christian faith.  And perhaps Christian viewers who saw this film were inspired.  I guess I naively thought that if I saw it I would come away with some insight about the central theme of Christianity.  That didn't happen.  Actually, I found the plot extremely difficult to follow and, with the exception of the 90% of the film devoted to the torture of Christ, it wasn't clear to me what was going on.  As a matter of fact, there were some parts that made me wonder if some of it was actually in the bible.For example, one of the early scenes shows Christ and a woman shortly before he is arrested.  I guess she's supposed to be the Satan or the forces of evil.  We're supposed to understand that she's a bad guy because there's a worm coming out of her nose and later there's a serpent springing at Jesus.  This woman shows up throughout the film, floating, instead of walking around, especially during the scenes where Jesus is being beaten.  This flogging is perhaps the longest part of the film.  And this is not a simple beating.  The cruel soldiers are large and laugh at his pain.  He is whipped first with sticks and then irons with cruel hooks on them.  His flesh is literally pulled from his body.  It goes on and on and on and on.  And the audience sees every stroke and every wound on his body over and over and over again in living color and in vivid close-ups.  Tears came to my eyes just from the horror and the suffering of it all.  And we hadn't even gotten to the crucifixion yet.The dialog was in Aramaic and Latin.  Some of it wasn't translated.  But it was clear that the soldiers, too, were the bad guys.  Maybe they were just doing their jobs.  But they were bad guys because they enjoyed it so much.The crowd of people who called for Jesus' death were bad guys too.  I guess they were Jews.  But so were Jesus' mother and all the disciples.  Judas who told the authorities where Jesus was hiding for 30 pieces of silver was also a bad guy.  But he got his comeuppance when he felt guilt and then was chased by a group of children whose faces turned to evil using the best of Hollywood's computer distortion techniques.It never was clear to me who was who and some of the plot confused me.  John was shown with Mary and kept calling her Mother.  If I didn't know better I would have thought that he was Jesus' brother.  And again, if I didn't know better I would have though Mary Magdalene was Jesus' sister until a short flashback showed her wearing long earrings and being saved by Jesus from being stoned to death.  It was also never really clear why the crowd wanted Jesus to die.One of the best roles, as written, was given to Pontius Pilate.  He, alone, had some choice in the matter.  Even the King, Herod, had found no crime that Jesus had committed.  So Pontius Pilate had a choice, as governor of the area, whether or not to condemn Jesus to death.  Here was a conflicted man who had to make a choice.  He gave in to the crowd though instead of following his own conscience.  And the way his scenes were written, it was understandable why he made that choice.Sooner or later, all that depiction of suffering becomes numbing.  I couldn't wait for the film to end.  And even though there were some brief flashbacks, I would have liked to see more about Jesus' life, not his death.  Also, for someone without a Christian background I still don't understand why he had to go through all that suffering.  I also wonder if an earthquake really occurred at the moment of his death, splitting the palace in two and destroying a temple.  And I wonder if, by making this a Hollywood spectacular, this particular film didn't somehow take away from each believing Christian his or her own personal version of what actually happened.  Surely, the film it is a landmark that will forever be imbedded in people's minds as the actual truth.  However, it is in reality just one man, Mel Gibson's version of this most influential story in the Christian world.The Passion of the Christ is a disturbing film.  I hated watching the torture.  I felt uncomfortable not really understanding.  However, I did not come away with a feeling of it being anti-Semitic.  I would never ever recommend this film for children.  As for adults, however, I think it is an important film.  I hold back on recommending it to anyone though.  The choice is entirely personal.	4.0	Will be long remembered as the actual truth, not just a film	2004-04-23	11	8	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A4IZUA8KQGTDX	Lindsay	"Before I give my thoughts on the movie away I want to address certain problems that have arisen here. First of all, there seem to be several persons who're creating numerous accounts to bash this movie and to insult those who believe in what is called Christianity. Now I'm not a Christian, I'm not a believer of any kind, but I do know the words respect and tact. The reviews in question (Written by the same...person) were as obnoxious as it can get. the thing is that all that guy wants to do is upsetting people. I'm glad that nobody is reacting to that garbage because that is all that little twit wants: Attention. Now why do I think that these obscene and rude comments don't belong here? They violate Amazon's guidelines in every way (I already wrote to Amazon about this), they are rude, obnoxious, filled with prejudiced generalisations, ignorant ""research"" (Ever READ the historical evidence?)... As for some history: No matter how many idiots repeat the nonsense posted here, Jesus did exist and no he was not made up. (I guess the Romans wouldn't write about a fictional character, even if THAT was the only argument.......) Now how much of his message you believe is up to you. But as much as it's not right to spread vicious lies on Jews and their faith (Doesn't history teach us ANYTHING?) nobody has the right to insult others for their beliefs, whether they're Christians, Muslims or Wiccans. That is how some of the greatest wars started and how some of the world's most scary events took place.I find it to be odd that only this movie is plagued by these trolls (While other classics involving Jesus like ""Ben Hur"" or ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" are left in peace) and honestly, the greatest pieces of art are either loved or hated. And honestly, great scholars of whichever religion have given Christ respect for his teachings, his message of loving thy neighbour... Even wise atheists respect Christ as a great philosopher and teacher. Sounds too romantic? Maybe. Maybe in this world filled with obnoxious arrogance and overrated self-confidence the purity of such a message seems ridiculous. Now I can see that many find it hard to believe in anything they cannot touch with their little hands. But can you hold the wind? Can you hold a scent, a soul in your hands? No? Yet it's still there and not reviled.And that is why I, even as a non-Christian, rate this movie highly. As for the accusation of Anti-Semitism: It's as ridiculous as calling the movie Schindler's list ""anti-German"". Plus it weren't the Jews who crucified Jesus but the Romans. It is gory, yes. It is intense and hard to watch. But beneath it lies eternal love. And to clear up another lie: The church isn't getting the money this movie made. Whoever spills such vicious crap should do his homework first. What I will do and ask every person with a brain to do is to report the violations of the guidelines around here and to ignore the fools who spread lies because of envy, poor research and hatred. Hatred always loses to rational research. And that is why this attention-craving ""reviewer"" doesn't ""win"" but he gives those who are non-Christians (like me) a bad name. I want to apologise for all this person posted, we're not all trolls like that. In short: He obviously doesn't have a life, hence he creates tons of new identities to bash a movie and a faith he cannot destroy. Too bad that his Mama obviously didn't teach him any manners."	5.0	What is all this about?	2005-03-10	8	6	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AR1II55EVOUFK	Liora	Secular critics have criticized the extreme gore and manipulative qualities of the movie. Christian leaders have applauded the realistic depiction of Jesus' death and resurrection. Millions of people have seen this movie, and the reactions are wildly mixed-- but why?There are some people who do not wish to see someone beaten and tortured to death. There are others who are jaded by the culture of morality that often surfaces in modern American. There are some that believe Mel Gibson can do no wrong.I am none of these people.I enjoyed this movie because of the honesty behind it, the spectacularly moving plot and dialogue, and the amazing cinematography.I am a Christian myself, so I was interested in seeing this movie. It was truly a spiritual experience for me-- not just because I've been told this story many, many times. Seeing this on film strengthened my faith to a certain degree, but it also gave me some new hope for Hollywood. People are now making movies that have the same simplicity, drive, and passion that the old classics do. Gibson's film isn't sappy or even _that_ preachy. It is based  on documented scriptures and of the visions of several prolific Catholic saints, but it seems very historical. Many historians doubt that Jesus existed, but his presence is far too important to have been a fable. I (along with nearly a billion others)call myself a Christian. This film highlights the importance of Jesus' death and sacrifice while functioning as a truly successful work of cinematic art.Very moving. 5/5	5.0	Deserves the Hype	2005-04-06	19	13	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A14773TMWZ090F	Lisa Kanus	"Mel seems to have been more influence by pictures on holy cards than historical fact related to crucifiction: Christ would not have carried the entire cross but only the cross beam (come on!!! after all that flogging and beating could anyone drag that entire cross???). Also, he would not have been nailed through the hands, but through the wrists. If he were nailed through the hands anatomically he would have ripped right off the cross! Also, if you believe the Shroud of Turin is authentic, then you have to note that the Christ in Gibson's movie was probably overflogged (in all reality, if Christ was flogged the way he was in Gibson's movie, he probably would have collapsed or died of blood loss (much less have been able to drag the whole cross). Now lets get down to money: with the release of this DVD today, no doubt many people will rush out to buy it right away. But wait, there's got to be more no doubt! No sooner will you buy this DVD then there will be the release of the supper special fat collector's edition with more interviews, previously unseen whipping scenes and the behind the scenes stuff. Then there will be released to newly remastered, superuncut, director's personal edition with three new songs by Disney (oops, sorry Disney, you bought out on this one and you''ll have to use your songs somewher else. Good thing for Mel on this count!) Anyway, it's nice to see religious movies comming into the theaters again.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"Mel Gibson poured millions of his own money into creating this movie, and spent incredible amounts of time researching the historical accuracy of every detail. In that sense you can say the movie is the ""child"" of Passion of the Christ, which had previously raised the bar in historical accuracy of Biblical movies. Gibson even went so far as to film the entire movie in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew, the languages of the time. Mel's vision was to document the last 12 hours of Jesus' life in excruciating detail, using the Gospels and historic research to make this as accurate as possible. There are minor problems - like nailing the hands instead of the wrists, and the Romans speaking Latin instead of the more common Greek - but most is very well done.It would have been a very interesting film if he had done this task in a ""traditional"" manner - having the last supper, having the scene with Pilate, having the crucifixion. We've seen all of those scenes done before, many times. We know them and understand them. The key issue that made this movie so incredibly controversial was the amount of GORE involved in Mel's vision. In addition, many Jews felt uncomfortable that the movie made them culpable for Jesus' death.Let's take the second issue first. Jesus did in fact rail against the current Jewish powers many times. Remember, he was a Jew himself! He was raised in the Jewish fashion. He was taught to follow those laws. But he felt many of those in power has corrupted the laws. It is like modern Catholics taking a stand against priests who rape children. Jesus wasn't saying ""all Jews are evil"". He was saying ""You who do these certain practices should stop."" Naturally, those who were in power took steps to protect their power. All Jews who exist in modern times aren't responsible for the actions of those leaders 2,000 years ago. It's something that happened in ancient times.I don't find the movie to be an indictment against all current Jews, any more than all current Christians are individually responsible for the horrors of the Inquisition. All religions had leaders at some point who did ""bad things"". We can't erase history and pretend it didn't happen. We learn about it, we understand it, and then we do better in the future.So, on to the gore part. First, I think we can all agree that crucifixion was a horrible way to die. There's been plenty of research on it - on the foot-rest and bottom-rest that helped ensure that the victim didn't asphyxiate immediately but rather lived in agony for days - to know that this was a public display of absolute agony. And as if that wasn't enough, they would beat the person very severely first, so that they were in pain before they even went onto the cross.To see anybody going through this process would be incredibly heart-wrenching to watch. To see someone go through it who did it *willingly*, in order to save all of mankind, is of course even more powerful. I accept that, and understand how meaningful it is to those who believe in the message of love and peace that Jesus was trying to spread. It would be like seeing Martin Luther King, or Gandhi, tortured in slow motion for 3 hours straight.That all being said, the ""truth"" of the situation was bad enough, without having to exaggerate it. It was like watching a Kurosawa film at times, with the huge amount of blood involved. It got to the point where you began to think, ""You must be kidding!"" That is a real shame, because most of us accept that Jesus was a historical person who went through this, whether or not he was a messiah. This was a truly awful punishment he went through. It should be appreciated as such, not overdone.A side problem with turning the ""punishment"" part of the movie into such an overly violent one is that kids cannot see the movie. The story, with its authentic setting, languages and well done acting, could have been incredibly powerful for kids to see. As it stands, the movie would give them nightmares for months. Jesus didn't preach psychologically scarring children and young adults. He preached love and gentleness.You could propose the argument that Mel should have filmed all of Jesus' life, not just the last 12 hours. Maybe he should have filmed the last 12 days. But of course, any director who makes a movie chooses what to make the movie of. Mel chose the last 12 hours. Since that is what he wanted to focus on, that's what he did. We as viewers have to accept that. There are certainly enough other movies that cover the other time periods. However, if Mel IS going to take on the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, it would have made sense to have those 12 hours be shown in a meaningful manner - that is, tell the story of the events that happened in those 12 hours, and why they were important.Instead, it's almost as if, to Mel, the volumes of blood pouring out were the only story. The other characters around the blood are pretty two dimensional. There are crying people, there are laughing people, there are impassive people. There is Jesus, in incredible pain, and there is blood. It's not a story as much as a bloodfest. It's not watching a movie as much as watching a documentary of someone being tortured for multiple hours. And again, it's not even a documentary - it's a very exaggerated portrayal of that activity.Surely we could appreciate the pains that Jesus went through just as much with a realistic portrayal. Also, surely those pains would have had even more meaning if they were given a context. If we could have seen more interaction between Jesus and the Jewish leaders, between him and the apostles, between Judas and the others. In the time span given, Jesus didn't ""do"" much. He didn't have a choice. He just lay there writhing while pain was inflicted on him. It's not really that he ""willingly"" took the pain. He *helplessly* took the pain, like a newborn puppy. That's not beneficial to watch - it's desensitizing.To say you must endure multiple hours of excessive gore to understand Christ is like saying you must watch multiple hours of graphic child rape scenes to understand why child rape is bad. There's a reason that soldiers often come back from war and don't want to talk about the experience. It's truly awful. They went through it to keep the rest of us safe. They have serious psychological problems as a result. We don't show people graphic documentaries of our friends and families being horribly mutilated in order to understand the soldiers' issues. Yes, I realize crucifixion is awful, I realize the pre-crucifixion beatings were nasty. But to make that the only message of a multi-hour movie, when so much *meaningful* content happened during that time period and was ignored, seems to be quite against what Jesus himself preached. He preached love, forgiveness and peace. This movie is soaked in blood, and embeds violent, graphically gory visual images in the viewers' heads. I don't think that would be what Jesus wanted people to remember him for."	3.0	Great Authenticity, but Excessive Gore	2005-12-27	28	12	16

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AP8V14J83IPYA	"""littlekasper90"""	I was very eager to see this movie as i heard more and more reviews of it, and more and more reactions to it. I have heard many things about it, both good and bad, and now that ive seen it, i need to state my opinion. Some undoubtedly will not like my review, as it will definitely have a Christian viewpoint, but i dont like a lot of the reviews atheists, or people of whatever other religion, have written.(This may contain spoilers)I must say that i really loved this movie. It was without question one of the most accurate depictions of this story that i have ever seen, and it gave me a new knowledge of what Christ actually endured.I was amazed at what i saw. No matter how much you hear about it from other people, nothing can prepare you for what you see in this movie.The opening scene is very intriguing, and also a great way to open the story. The encounter with Satan is interesting, despite the fact that Satan is very repungent and annoying.Some said that the movie didnt give them enough content to get to know Jesus, to be able to appreciate what Jesus actually did. I do not think that is true, however. The opening scene gives you something of his mindset, and the flashbacks provide an idea of what his life was like before the closing day, allowing you to understand the basis of what he did, and what his purpose was. If that isnt enough for you, you can read the entire story in the New Testament.The brutal beatings he suffered were enbelievably realistic, and the fact that he was so battered that he could barely stand only made it more touching. This is not at all overdone, no matter how gruesome it was. Historians have studied Roman crusifixions, and they really were that violent. And no, he wouldn't have been dead by then. That is just the way Roman torture worked.And now i really need to blow the claims that it is antisemitic. It is not at all, it simply tells the story as it is. It doesnt even lay the blame on the Jews. Did you notice that at every crucial moment, Satan popped up in the crowd. This serves, among other things, to tell you that Satan was the real cause of all of it. And the scene with the temple being split, that is just another fact mentioned in the Bible, which does not symbolize anything antisemitic either. It is mentioned multiple times in the New Testament that this symbolizes that the way into the Most Holy Place (or in other words the way to God), is now open to everyone. In Old Testament times, only the High Priest could enter the Most Holy Place, but at the time of Jesus death, the curtain was torn, making the Most Holy Place open to everyone, not meaning anything about Judaism being a dying religion (as one reviewer said).I also saw one review which said that Pilate was the real villain, and that it made him look sympathetic to Jesus, while making the Jews look like the ciminals. Having already disproved the comment that it made the Jews look guilty, i must disprove the claim that Pilate was the real villain. That reviewer simply didnt know the real Biblical story to be able to say whether it was accurate or not. In the Bible, it also says that Pilate didnt want to kill Jesus, and that he did indeed try to save him with the offer, Jesus or Barabbas. Even the part about Pilate's wife is Biblically accurate.Taking all of this into consideration, along with the awesome score and amazing cinematography, i must say that this is an unbelievable movie, certainly exceeding my expectations. I think that it deserves several academy awards, although that was not the purpose of making it. I really just want to say that this is just an awesome movie.(...)	5.0	An Amazing Depiction of an Amazing Story	2004-04-07	1	1	0

I watched it and thought, 'I weep when I see Him in my own eyes, I don't need a movie screen to tell me what He suffered for.'Yes, I am a Christian and believed in the story of the Christ. This movie was a remarkable adaptation of it, but there were some movie elements that just...irked me.Pros: Emotional, remarkable adaptation of the Christ story, very few stones are left unturned. Cavaziel played an amazing Christ, emotionally and physically. Shows the pain and suffering He endured to maybe scare people? Very good ending.Cons: Violence! (More on that at the end) Strange cinemotography. Weird movie effects like the weird demony things.Note on the violence: Yes, the Christ story was VERY violent but this movie pushed it just a little too far. I can understand showing the suffering, but along with that it should have showed the love that was among His followers. This showed only the hate and betrayal. That, and the cinemotography and movie effects lost it a star.Bottom line: This is a life changing experience for some, but it is NOT, I repeat, NOT for small children under ANY circumstance!

Now, where's my five dollars?Second thing -- this film TOTALLY ROCKED.  I was like in Blockbuster last Friday and all the Wrestlemania tapes were out, and so I'm all bummed, and this dude Keifer that I went to high school with works there, so he's like ""brother, you should watch 'The Passion of the Christ.'  It changed my life.""  Granted, Keifer hasn't exactly been right since he lost three fingers trying to make a pipe bomb when we were sophomores.  But he used to be like the local meth king; if you needed the ol' hillbilly heroin, you called Keifer.  And now he like goes to church every Sunday and doesn't cuss and is nice to his mom.So I'm thinkin' whatever, right?  I just wanted to get stoned and order some wings from Dominos.  So I rent it, put it in the DVD player.  First, they're like speaking frickin' Palestinian or something.  What the #%&@?  I'm not trying to read subtitles or guess what Jesus is saying.  I thought he spoke English!  In fact, I remember one time I told my grandma they were going to start making us learn Spanish in school, and she said ""if the English language was good enough for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then it's good enough for the schoolchildren of the state of Texas!""  So anyway, the film's in wackalackalese.  Strike one.  Plus it's all like religious, and here I'm gettin' frmnked up.  So strike two -- downer!But then it's like Jesus totally starts getting the crap beat out of him!  And I'm like ""NO.  FREAKING.  WAY.""  I mean, they straight off TORE JESUS UP!  And I'm all ""Dude!  This is SO much better than Wrestlemania!""  The whole time I'm thinking that Jesus could be the WWF champion if he really did come back.  Wouldn't that be like the best wrestling angle EVER?  Triple H versus The Rock for the WWF championship, live in Madison Square Garden.  Thirty minutes of non-stop action.  Finally The Rock lays Trips out with a vicious chairshot.  Then he cocks The People's Eyebrow and bounces off the ropes to deliver The People's Elbow.  Then, out of nowhere, Jesus comes to the ring and totally wastes The Rock with a 2x4!  Then Hunter gets up and Jesus like turns him into a pile of crap or a giant bug!  Jesus pins The Rock, kicks Triple H in his cockroach @$$ or whatever, and makes his Glorious Appearing.To me, that would be the coolest way for the Son of God to return.  If you're listening, Jesus, give it some thought.  And don't be scared of Mel Gibson's movie; I think he meant it as a compliment.  Of course, you've been watching people wear you around their necks for years, a billion little Jesuses nailed to a billion golden crosses.  That's got to be totally creepy to you, and I'll bet you wish people would quit it.  If some dude punched me in the face, and then for the rest of my life there were like paintings and sculptures of it everywhere, I'd be a little sore about it.  So if you can stand to be reminded of that all the time, you should be fine with this film.

This is the way it should be, for a questioning mind gives one the potential to make one's faith stronger than ever. If, after questioning, one's faith does not hold up, it was never true faith to begin with.This is the crux of the movie. In one scene, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate bitterly asks his wife Claudia the same question he had asked Jesus: ""What is truth?"" Of course this is a rhetorical question, having no easy answers, and meant to provoke thought and discussion rather than a solution. Watching Jeh-su-ah be scourged endlessly by Roman soldiers who are physically quivering with sadistic desire makes viewers think why? Why did this all happen? And so the question What is truth? leads to the question: What is faith?The brief scene at the end of the movie eloquently sums up both the film and the last question."	4.0	Impassioned	2004-07-04	9	4	5

I also must say I really had no desire to see this movie. It just didn't seem to be one to really spark my interest.The night before Easter last year this movie was shown on HBO. I had nothing planned for the night, so I watched it. At first I was bored. I wasn't big on the English subtitles, even though I watch everything with subtitles, but I continued watching.This is probably the only movie that has ever touched me like it did. I was in tears, sobbing. The acting was incredible & the pain endured in the movie almost made you feel as if it were real. I think this movie was protrayed very well. I would recommend this movie, but I would like to warn you to watch it & not plan anything for the rest of the day. I was glad it was late so I could just come home and think about things & cry. Trust me, if you felt like I did it will change your outlook on many things.	5.0	Plan nothing else for the rest of the day after you watch this film!	2006-09-05	17	12	5

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2MG8DHACXH5MS	"Lola Jovita ""Literary Fan"""	Mel Gibson rich film telling of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is vivid, violent, and a terrifying display of passionate storytelling based on the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Gibson has the actors speak in the native dialects they would have spoken at the time of Jesus: Aramaic for Jews, Latin and Greek for the Romans. This is what makes the gospels come alive far more than previous biblical films for it is the living language of the time that transcends the blur of history and theology.James Caviezel's portrayal of Yeshua is stunning. Whether you believe in God or not ... this is the Jewish Yeshua set in the context of Jewish Messianic expectations, the legal political warfare of Rome, and the religious fever mixed with jealousy from the Pharisees. Caviezel's Roman Catholic devotion comes through in his emotional displays from the Garden of Gethsemane, the Sermon on the Mount, and the Crucifixtion. This is human Yeshua, the Jewish Yeshua, the Messiah incarnate, and the threat of the High Priest and Roman Governors.Mel Gibon played great attention to detail in every scene and recreates the gospel accounts of New Testament apostles in a way far different from previous films. This is a haunting depiction of one of history's most controversial figures ... and leaves a question: Was Yeshua just a rebellious Jewish rabbi, a false Messiah, the true Messiah whose birth fulfilled the promise of Moses, or a mythical concoction of Roman pagan myths, Jewish mysticism, and religious distortion that has fooled mankind for 2000 years? The Passion leaves many probings that can not be answered. It stays true to the New Testament, reveals its Roman Catholic leanings, and leaves even the un-religious to take notice.	5.0	The Passion - the blood, sweat, and tears of Jesus of Nazareth	2007-07-13	2	2	0

Now, onto the film...I understand that the film is about the last 12 hours of Christ so yes, violence will happen. But to show it in such a gratuitous manner for the ENTIRE film? That was not necessary. There are other ways to tell this story and when you take the violence out of the film, you really don't have a film. Keeping that in mind, this film only caters to those who already know the story of Jesus Christ. If you already believe in your faith, then I don't see the point in watching Jesus beaten to death and crucified. Now, had Mel Gibson chosen to add some extra contents to the DVD and explain his intentions, or add more depth or something, it certainly would have been helpful. So to those of you out there who aren't Christians, if you want to learn about Jesus, go to church, get a bible or find some alternative film or program. I also want to say to parents that I've been watching horror and other ""R"" rated films since I was 6 years old and as a 27 year old now, this to me was far more disturbing.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1I9B4PSCDDWOO	"lordhoot ""lordhoot"""	"In many ways, this movie feels like your typical Hollywood Biblical movie. While many Christians may be moved by the message that lies in the film, many others may be grossed out by the exaggrated violence in the film.I supposed the best way to answer one of the main questions, was this film anti-Semitic can best be answered like this. If you are a Christian with a good knowledge of the Gospels, then the answer will be ""NO"". But if you are just taking the movie alone by its content, with no knowledge of the Gospels, then the answer is ""YES"". (Non-Christians would regard this film as anti-Semitic.)Is the movie historically authentic? To a point, yes it is to a limited point. After all its a Hollywood production type of film. First point, while it nice to heard Latin and Aramaic spoken, you also needs to put Greek in there since that was the universal language like English is today. Second point, old Hollywood trick of using white people to play ancient Semitic is like using white people to play Indians in old John Wayne films. Entertaining but its not history. One of the previous reviewers stated that Jews were Caucasians, maybe today but not back in the first century AD. Semitic people are not Caucasians!!! Third point have to be the cross. Romans used a ""T"" cross, Mr. Gibson, not the Latin cross. But Hollywood embellishment is okay I supposed for personal creativity. Fourth point, if Roman legionaires must be ""nazified"" by Mel, then do put them in proper uniforms instead the cheap Hollywood props! Lorica segmentata is made of steel plates, not leather!! I guess I can say more but it would pointless after the tenth page or so.The movie proves to be totally gory and utterly unrealistic. No man on earth can take the punishment movie Jesus took from the Romans and still be standing. (Unless you are Rambo!!) Remember folks, He don't become divine until after He have risen. Until then, He was fresh and blood like you and I. Turning Him into a hunk of beef and then having Him carry that cross is beyond any human ability.But the cruxification scene was well done. Wrong cross but overall, it was the best part of the movie.The movie could be better if Mel Gibson considered Jesus as a man and as a redeemer instead of some victim of sadistic initiation into Godhood.

""The Passion of the Christ"" is a must see movie for all denominations and faiths.  Not only will you find yourself either weeping or wanting to weep, but you will come away with the feeling that Christ went through all of that for all of us.  And he went through all of that as the Son of Man.  When I saw this in the theater I turned to my fiance and said, ""Wow.""  I had no other word for it at the time.And as far as the anti-Semitic controversy -- the way I see it, there were both good and bad Jews in the film, just as there were in the actual story (remember, there were many along the path who were helping him as well as cursing him because they didn't know who he was).  If Gibson didn't show that, it would be like making a World War II movie without having the Japanese or Germans as the bad guys.Overall, this movie very quickly moved to the #1 spot of my all time favorite films after I saw it."	5.0	One of the most powerful films you will see in your lifetime	2004-07-11	4	2	2

After such controversy over the film, I was surprised that there was no Christian continuum, and that the cardinal sin of greed was instead rewarded.  Another poor moral lesson:  his father, who has written books  praising the virtues of Anti-Semitism and debunking the Holocaust, Mel Gibson  went on record saying that he loves his father and all that he stands for (even Arnold Schwartzenegger, whose father was a Nazi, made amends for this in the past by speaking out against bias, prejudice and hate, saying that what his Nazi father did and said was something that is anti-Jesus).I was further disappointed that the lessons of the Bible and of Jesus  apparently don't  apply in Gibson's case, who abuses his body with alcoholism,drugs and chain smoking, and excessive cheating on his wife (he has gone on record with this).Maybe Mel Gibson is not a man of God at all.	1.0	Very poor moral lesson in the end	2005-07-23	38	18	20

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2M80WYE7H6LRS	Louis E. Yaklich III	"This movie is great; very well organized, script is wonderfully written, the soundtrack is awesome, the performances are terrific, and the way that the story is presented is incredible.  It will captivate your attention from beginning to end.  It is Biblically and historically accurate.  The movie is very violent, but there are popular video games that are more violent and the content of James Bond movies are worse than the Passion of the Christ.The movie has some parts that are not mentioned in the Bible, or history, but do bring the movie to life and/or help develop the Gospel in the movie.  For instance, in the movie, Satan follows Jesus the whole way trying to tempt Jesus not to die on the cross so that Jesus would not provide salvation from sin, and when Jesus dies, Satan is screaming from Hell because he realizes that he has lost the war.While I may not agree with all the little details, I whole-heartedly agree with the Big Picture presented in the movie.  Jesus Christ is not just presented as a good man and good moral teacher; but also as the Son of God, Savior and Redeemer of the world, the promised Messiah, Sovereign Ruler of the University, and descendant of Israel's King David and the future King of the Jews who will restore the throne of David forever.When I first saw that Hollywood was making a movie about the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ, I thought, `Oh no, here comes another secular version of Jesus.'  But when I saw the movie in theaters, I was blown away.Christians can definitely use the Passion of the Christ as a witnessing tool.  The movie does not present the whole Gospel.  There are lots of little abstract lines, such as: when Jesus is carrying the cross, he says to his mother, ""I am making all things new.""  The movie does not thoroughly explain the whole story, but it presents a good part of it.  Therefore, Christians must be ready to explain the rest.`The Passion of the Christ' has been called anti-Jewish; but it is no more anti-Jewish than `Schindler's List' is anti-German.  Is Tolstoy's `War and Peace' anti-French?  Is James Fennimore Cooper's `Last of the Mohicans' anti-American Indian?  Is `Red Dawn' anti-Russian?  Is Orwell's `1984' racist toward anyone?  I believe the answer is `no'.  For all of the Jews and Gentiles who condemned Jesus, a significant number believed that Jesus Christ was innocent and followed him.  Besides, despite all that happened, Jesus willingly went through everything.Anyone who truly understands the Christian Bible will understand that the Jews, who are also the children of Israel, are God's chosen people forever, (Gen. 15:18, Gen. 17, Ex. 6:4-5, Lev. 26:42-45, Deut. 4:31, Deut. 4:37, Deut. 5:2-3, Deut. 7:9, Deut. 8:18, Deut. 10:15, Jud. 2:1, 2Sa. 7:24, 2Kings 13:23, 1Ch. 16:15-17, 1Ch 17:22, Ps. 105:8-10, Isa. 54:10, Jer. 30:9, Jer. 31:33, Eze. 20:5, Eze. 37:19-28, Da. 11:32, Hos. 1:17, Hos. 3:5, Zeph. 2:7, Zech. 10:6, Zech. 12:5).  God spoke of the children of Israel when he said ""They will be my people and I will be their God,"" (Gen. 17:8, Ex. 29:45-46, Lev. 26:12, 2Sa 7:24, 1Ch. 17:22, 2Ch 6:1-11, Ps. 50:7, Jer. 7:23, Jer. 11:4, Jer. 24:7, Jer. 30:9, Jer. 30:22, Jer. 31:1, Jer. 31:33, Jer.32:38, Jer. 50:4, Eze. 11:20, Eze. 14:9-11, Eze. 34:24, Eze. 34:30, Eze. 36:28, Eze. 37:12-13, Eze. 37:23, Eze. 37:27, Eze. 39:7, Hos. 1:10, Hos. 2:23, Joel 2:26-27, Zeph. 2:9, Zech. 8:8, Zech. 10:6, Zech. 13:9).  Moses also spoke of the promised Messiah when he said to Israel, ""God will raise up another prophet like me from among you,"" (Deut. 18:15).  God spoke through the prophet Isaiah about the Messiah when he said ""It is too small a task for my Holy One to redeem Israel, I shall make him a light to the Gentiles,"" (Isa. 49:6-7).  Jesus Christ said of the Law of Moses and the prophets, ""I have not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it,"" (Matt. 5:17).Many of us are familiar with Mel Gibson's recent law violation, when he was pulled over for drunk driving and then slandered the Jewish people.  I do not hold it against him since he was quick to confess and admit he was wrong; he asked for forgiveness; he agreed to restitution and he is working to not make the same mistake again.  I hope other people will forgive him too.This is a great movie for everyone regardless of age, race, or creed.  Since it is violent, Parents should watch this movie before allowing children under 14 to watch it.  Eastern Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Atheists, Agnostics, Homosexuals, Humanists, Animists and even Satan worshippers should watch the Passion of the Christ.""The Passion of the Christ"" will stand alongside with other epics like ""The Ten Commandments"""	5.0	Bravo; Well done; Excellent job	2006-12-24	22	13	9

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2B38SAPMNOD1V	Lou M	"The ""Passion of Christ"" is a genuine masterpiece. The film, not withholding all the controversy around it, was a movie that no one wanted to finance.  In the beginning, it was a film that Mel Gibson invested 30 million dollars for his own true and visual interpretation.  At the end, he extended his hand for someone to distribute it and yet, it almost didn't happen.  Now, after its miraculous statement at the box office and on a personal level, Hollywood and the Media is on a frenzy.  Be that as it may, this film as an artistic standpoint is extremely powerful.Christian Believers will marvel, tear and feel the power of their faith rise to the surface.  This film was not made to pursuade or educate anyone about christianity but to strength their faith.  The film is about the last 12 hours of Christ. Therefore,  Non-believers, will see it as a brutal depiction of a man being tortured, ridiculed and slained.  That being said, I believe no one can deny the power, the visual artistry and the genuine love that was placed into the film.In comparison to the other hollywood films depicting the life of Christ that were made (""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""The King of Kings"") suffice it to say, this film is an original masterpiece that will be held as symbol of christianity for decades to come.Bravo, Mel Gibson,  for instituting your belief, your dedication and uncompromising vision to the big screen and allowing your voice to be heard."	5.0	Incredibly Powerful.....	2004-04-10	6	4	2

Pacheco ""BHOC"""	"While this film is by far one of the most graphic and bloody films I have ever seen, I truly believe it is absolutely necessary to validate the true horrors Jesus Christ suffered on His way to the cross.  It is an excellent film with incredible artistic and realistic values often portrayed in all great epics, and is a must-see film for all!Despite the controversial anti-Semitic allegations, we held a special screening the day before the film's release nationwide, and invited many Jews.  All of them were extremely moved and emotionally distraught because they had no idea how horrific the crucifixion really was.  But, none of them felt the film was at all anti-Semitic.  One gentleman even stated that he could see how the Jewish religious leaders and many Jews were responsible for the literal suffering of Jesus, but he also took note that there were many other Jews portrayed in the film who were distraught over Jesus' suffering and the brutality inflicted upon Him by the Romans.  He answered the allegations of anti-Semitism with this:  ""You can't blame the entire race for the inflictions caused by a few...It would be like blaming every white person for the suffering of the black slaves during the Civil War era.  Not everyone can be responsible for the act of a few.""This movie is by far the most incredible and realistic depiction of Christ's last twelve hours, filled with incredible performances by Jim Caviezel and Mya Morgenstern, who portrays Jesus' mother, Mary.  While the film's obvious focus is on those last twelve hours of Christ, Mel Gibson does an incredible job of also telling the story of Mary's heartbreak as she endures tremendous maternal suffering, following her son to the cross.  Every parent could completely relate to Mary's own suffering and how horrified she must have felt.On the darker side, an often forgotten character is added to the storyline as satan is introduced as the tempter in the Garden of Gethsemane and often appears during the suffering and torment of Christ, which is an interesting addition to the story.Overall, this film is definitely not for children under the age of 12, and parental discretion is absolutely advised.  But, be sure to purchase the DVD when it comes out and share it with those same children when they get older.  It is a must-see for everyone in order to appreciate the true meaning of sacrifice, grace, and love.  Go see it in the theatre for the full impact of the film, and don't wait for the DVD.  Unless you have a huge screen TV, you will most likely miss some of the incredible impact when it is reduced to a smaller size.  So, go see it while it's in theaters.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1TWTULVD6F22O	"L. Quido ""quidrock"""	A moving, if somewhat over-the-top score, amazing cinematography, the mystical strength of having the film spoken in the ancient languages, and a brilliant execution by a fine ensemble of performers.........all of this is quickly forgotten as the filmgoer tries to make sense of how much carnage and how many unspeakable close-ups of torture fill the screen.  Devout Christians are supposed to view the film and let Christ's suffering intensify their faith.Well, in my view, the story of Christ's last days is one of compassion, sorrow and inspiration for the sacrifice our Lord makes for his people.  The focus of this film seems less to inspire, than to sensationalize the rituals of punishment of the first century.  Gibson creates a hell on earth, a sort of sadistic, closely filmed depiction of Christ's suffering, which overshadows some of the deep poignance of the movie -- his relationships with his Mother and his followers, Christ at prayer, the Last Supper.Gibson shrugs it off by pointing to the fact that the ritual of crucifixion was real, the violence occurred.  If he is presenting reality according to the Gospels -- why the invention of the confrontation with Satan at Gethesemene, why the depiction of children as demons?  There are too many areas where Gibson allowed his own view of history to creep into the screenplay for him to play the reality card with what amounts to gratuitous violence.There is much in Gibson's film to be praised, much that inspires awe, but as a believer and a Catholic, I feel that he built too much melodrama into the film, and spent too little time putting the film into the context of Christ's entire time on earth.  That said, there was an enormity of feeling in the theater as the credits rolled -- definitely shock and awe.  I commend Gibson for speaking out about his vision, but I feel that artistically he failed to balance the message of his film.3 stars.	3.0	Intensity, not inspiration.	2004-02-28	14	5	9

I think that this movie is pretty realistic in showing the last hours of Jesus' life. It's very sad to see your savior ( although yes it is just a movie ) being tortured. I'm not going to say how anyone who thinks this is rubbish is a bad person or make any judgement on them, you believe what you want, we are givin that choice to do so.

It just ended with Jesus getting out of the grave, for goodness sakes! I didn't want to give any sort of negative comments, but the ending was really disappointing and the direction of the movie should have gone on to show more of Jesus' life after His resurrection. They should have done more, like they did on the mini-series about Christ and his resurrection that came on NBC 3 years ago during easter. Nevertheless, I thought that it was good that they were showcasing a movie about Jesus Christ and His life because the world needs to be exposed to God and religious material like this. The only thing is that it was too violent and gory; all those beatings and wipings made me jump every time it happened in the movie. I even had to cover my sister's eyes because the beating scenes were so gruesome and graphic. But it shows the length that Christ went to just to save humanity and restore redemption to a fallen world, and how important He is and should be. From the scenes in the garden of Gethsemane to His trial before Pilate, His premonition that he would be betrayed by the same disciples who swore their loyalty to the crucifixion, the movie accurately reflected biblical scripture in the life that Jesus lived. Don't pay attention to those so-called ""anti-semetic"" stuff because mainstream just did that divert attention and keep people from going to see the movie. The movie is good in showing Christ, and if people can go watch filthy and violent films then they can go see this one too."	4.0	Good Biblical Movie Reflecting the Life of Jesus Christ	2005-09-01	8	4	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2668R4F2JZRW2	L. SCEARCY	It is my understanding that the Pope said this after seeing the movie.  I agree with this.  The movie is faithful to the scriptures.  I read through the four gospels before attending the movie and could find nothing in the movie that would justify any criticism that it is not accurate.  I am tempted to believe that it is being criticized because it is accurate.  It is not anti-semitic.  It is very simply an accurate portrayal of Christ's last 12 hours of life on Earth - prior to his resurrection of course.  I believe that the gospel is clearly presented - I am an evangelical who is very grateful to Mr. Gibson.We as Christians in the US have a pretty sanitized concept of what Christ went through to die on the cross for our sins.  Mr. Gibson has challenged that in his masterpiece.  A Christian friend of mine stated after seeing the movie that she had no doubt that the movie was divinely inspired.  Before seeing the movie I was sceptical - after seeing it I have no doubt that it is.  You cannot leave this movie at the theatre - it will stay with you for the rest of your life.  I came away from the movie deeply moved - saddened by my part in Christ's suffering and deeply greatful that He loved us enough to die for us.  It will challenge you - to be a better person.One final thing - for those of you who have been put off by the media's concentration on the violence of the movie - every lady that I have spoken to who was concerned about seeing the movie for that reason - all came away with the conviction that the violence was not gratuitious and could have been much more graphic.  All were glad they had seen it and came away deeply blessed.  Also the portrayal of Mary in the movie speaks deeply to Mothers.	5.0	IT IS AS IT WAS - I AGREE	2004-03-06	3	1	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A5RFN14T7WJB	"L. Simler, Trustee ""ingrafted Jewess"""	Yes, this film was an amazing and difficult-to-watch presentation of Jesus' last hours.  In the theatre, I cringed and cried and could not watch the whipping, understanding how it was true that my sins were why those blows were struck. BUT, this is a VERY Catholic presentation(I was raised Catholic, so I know first-hand)of the events and there are Scriptural inaccuracies in the film.  In and of itself, it is not an effective tool for evangelism as some will use it.  Watch it carefully, and do not let young children (under 13) watch it alone.	4.0	From Mary's Point of View	2004-09-03	15	8	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2IIL8ER3UXSRB	L. Stone	I have seen this movie three times now and I feel I know this part of the gospels well, but in light of some books written by theologians condemning it I had to figure out why would you condemn such a movie. I know why the secular or Jewish community have condemned it that's obvious, but a man of God to do this just really perplexed me.  After reviewing some of the books written against this its apparent that a lot of it has to do with Catholicism as a whole rather than removing those tidbits and getting to the raw nature the film was intended to spark. Mel Gibson in an interview stated this was not to tell the WHOLE story of Jesus its intent was to show you visually the last 12 hours just exactly what we as sinners placed upon his perfect body and spirit. To say that Gibson interwove Catholic tendencies into this film sure after all he is Catholic. Do I agree with the way in which Catholics believe not entirely, but this should not detract from the film itself. Yes, Mary has a strong presence, but flip it around look at it from a parents stance you know your child's ending, the suffering he will endure what parent in their right mind would not want to try and save them. There is a scene in which Mary sees Jesus struggle and fall with the cross and the camera flashes back to Jesus falling as a child where Mary runs after him to try and SAVE him but the dichotomy is He is being put on the cross to save her and all of us. Some reviewers have likened this to a manipulation of guilt I honestly don't feel this was Gibson's intent but more so to make you understand Christ was born in the exact time of the most barbaric civilization ever. What better group of people to put the sins of man for all times on Christ after all he died and was separated from God his Father because of sin more than two thousand years of humanity's sin put on the body of a sinless man and you don't think its going to be brutal, violent and hard to watch WITHOUT feeling remorse or guilt. These same people can't get passed how brutal it was, but would watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a second. The realism is he was tortured for our sins. Is it easy to watch I would hope not. Does this stir your soul beyond its Catholic teaching in a realistic way? Absolutely ! The film is beautifully portrayed and seems realistic of the times. This film has ruined my entire family for any other so called Hollywood films. We even turned our satellite service off because we do not want to waste our time on secularism. Anyone who says God wouldn't want Christ depicted in this way because its to violent or not the overall character of Christ please explain to me why there is so much violence in the Bible and again no it does not depict Christ's character entirely this film was meant for those of us who already know the whole story. Christ's death and resurrection is just the beginning. Please avoid the negative hype and realize there are forces that don't want you to see what Christ accomplished through his death and resurrection. To say that it is to violent you would have define violent to me because of so many other just utterly grotesque films people would flock to the movie theaters to see, and the blood yes there is blood remember the old hymn there is Power in the Blood. Its sacred !	5.0	To violent according to whom...hhhmmm?	2005-03-22	16	13	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3QD0AS4MYDKB0	Lucas M. Engelhardt	In a single word this film is Awesome.  It communicates vividly precisely what the Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Son of God, was willing to do for us men and our salvation (to borrow words from the Nicene Creed).  Some may decry the differences with historical accuracy (placement of the nails, Pilate's use of eccesial Latin, etc.).  They miss the point.  The Passion is not a documentary.  It is an artistic representation of the suffering of Christ.  A suffering and death that He willingly accepted out of love for us all.Gibson does a marvelous job (following the Gospels and tradition) presenting the audience with a variety of characters with which we may identify.  Whether it be the Mother Mary, Peter, Simon, Veronica or someone else (perhaps even Judas Iscariot), I believe that we each can relate to at least one character in someway.  Personally, I related to Mary (strange, for a man).  This is probably because my natural inclination when I think of the crucifixion is to feel sorrowful joy and peace.  Sorrow at the sin of man, joy at the Provision of God through Christ, and peace that Reconciliation has come.  God's Divine Plan of salvation is one brimming over with self-giving Love.  And that is the Truth that Gibson communicates.May God bless us and keep us from harm.  May He lead us to eternal life.  Amen	5.0	A movie with Passion	2004-07-19	1	1	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3SED48SWHNV56	Lucifer	"I don't remember when they first started calling Good Friday, ""Good Friday,"" or why.  The Pharisees, okay, for THEM it was a good Friday, an excellent Friday, one of their favourites; but for Jesus it was not really such a good Friday, and if you have seen Mel Gibson's 5-star movie, The PASSION OF THE CHRIST, you will know exactly what I'm talking about.(If you have not yet seen the film, but have only heard the word, ""passion,"" then you may suspect that ""the Passion"" of Christ had something to do with tender feelings for Mary Magdalene, which would be a mistake:  ""passion""  is a word that used to mean ""suffering,"" as in the sense, ""I have no control over what that Roman centurion [or that foxy lady] does to me.""  The second kind of passion is something that Jesus never experienced all that much.)On 30 March, 31 CE, all Jerusalem turned out to watch Christ's Passion - all but the Twelve disciples, eleven of whom (until the dust settled) were lying low in Bethany, at Mary's Place (which was the only house around that had both a Jesus-friendly owner and plenty of beds); and the twelfth of whom (Judas Iscariot) was out shopping for real estate.  The Eleven good disciples had been up late the night before.  On Friday morning they were pretty tired, and somewhat drained emotionally, so they slept in (Matt. 26:56).  The apostle John finally showed up, at two o'clock, but he arrived too late to carry the cross, so the soldiers made this fellow, Simon of Cyrene, a Libyan tourist, carry it instead.Mel Gibson's film is accurate for the most part, except that the Jews get blamed for the whole fiasco; when in point of fact, the event went down pretty much as your heavenly Father planned.  The sado-masochistic violence, okay, some people don't know when to quit, and Mel Gibson is one of them.  Also, the Roman soldiers--like in that scene where they smashed the guy's legs as he hung on the cross next to Jesus.  For some Roman soldiers, that was their favourite part of a crucifixion, when they took turns smashing the victim's shins and knees with a wooden bat, to finish him off.  If those men had been born a thousand years earlier, and Jewish, they could have been Old Testament heroes.  Seriously: these Roman soldiers were not just tough on crime:  these guys were LAPD material.)But as I was saying, God the Father planned the event, including the 3-hour solar blackout (which gets short shrift in Gibson's film), and the earthquake.  Caiaphas, Chief Priest of the Jews, was actually pretty annoyed with Yahveh for sending the solar eclipse, because it seemed to him like Yahweh was taking sides.  ""First the healed ear of Malchus,"" said Caiaphas, ""and now this!""  But it wasn't like the Chief Priest could change his mind.  It wasn't like he could say, ""Whoops, sorry Jesus, we Jewish leaders and priests of Yahweh made a mistake!  Let's get you down from up there.""  He couldn't do that because, for one thing, it was way too dark.When the sun got switched back on again at 3:00 p.m., Caiaphas just shrugged his shoulders as if there were no connection between Golgotha and the solar event.  So God gave him another hint.  At 3:01, just as folks were getting off work, a shaker hit, a violent earthquake, about 7.2 on the Richter scale: ""The ground shook, and the rocks split, and the curtain of the Temple was torn in two."" Walls tumbled, roofs collapsed.  Stone tombs all over the holy land snapped open like walnuts (Matt. 28:45-52).That earthquake sent a powerful message to Caiaphas.  Many favourite dishes and clay pots at the Chief Priest's mansion were destroyed; plus, a section of roof over the rear portico collapsed, and fell into the wading pool, and damaged a lovely tile-mosaic of Aphrodite on the half shell.Unfortunately, the earthquake also sent a powerful message to Jesus.  It cannot feel good to be jiggled when you are being crucified.  But this was no jiggle.  Eyewitnesses said that the earthquake rocked Jesus' cross like a sailboat-mast in a high wind.  Then it waved the cross about like a kid with a burning brand.  Worst of all, I think, was when the earthquake pounded that cross up and down like a jackhammer (Matt. 27:54).Jesus always knew that the Crucifixion would be no picnic.  He knew it would be violent.  In his divine foreknowledge, he probably even knew that someone, someday, would make a graphic, sadistic movie about his suffering, to entertain a decadent Western society.  But I think he also thought, at this particular moment, that a teeth-rattling, jaw-banging earthquake was a little much, a little over the top.  ""My God!  My God!"" he said, ""Why have You forsaken me?"" Well, he probably didn't mean to say it aloud, but it just slipped out (Matt. 27:46).Jesus, to this very day, may harbor some feelings about that Good Friday Earthquake.  Couldn't his heavenly Father have waited until they took him down first?  Did Yahveh have no clue how that would feel, when His only begotten Son was bouncing up and down like that?  Really, it was uncalled for.  And I do think that God the Father owes Jesus an apology.Unfortunately, Yahveh's vocabulary has never included the phrase, ""I'm sorry.""- L."	5.0	By God, Mel Gibson really nailed this one!

The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2FNIVQU5N04F0	Luke	"Gibson's disturbing depiction of Christ's last 12 hours on earth, from the prayer at the Garden of Gethsemane to his crucifixion, burial and resurrection, is supposed to be an authentic reproduction of the Gospel accounts.  One could quibble with him here and there with the period details, but for the most parts they are spot-on, including the use of Aramaic and Latin, and the costume design and art direction.  What is more controversial is Gibson's choice of violence, used throughout the film, as Christ is being scourged and flayed to such a degree as to bleed the screen red all the time.  Did the Gospel portray such a bloody killing?  No one knows, but scientifically one has to suspend disbelief as any human being would have died long ago from such beatings, unless one is -- as possibly from Gibson's viewpoint -- miraculously conceived to suffer.  James Caviezel's Christ is a mute disfigurement of a person -- one who is born to endure than do anything else; depending on one's interpretation of the Gospels, this may either a travesty or an enlightenment of Christ's mission.Gibson's film raises important theological questions for anyone who watches the movie.  Gibson claims that he is not attacking the Jewish community, but his portrayal is misleading -- he takes away one important speech (""it is better for one man to suffer than for the whole nation to do so"") and categorizes Caiaphas into a bloodthirsty high priest, changing certain key moments (including Peter's denial of Jesus, which does not happen here in a courtyard).  Other violent scenes are gratuitous: like the crow's pecking of the thief's eye.  There are flashbacks of Christ's teaching,  but Gibson's film relegates these to backseat as he emphasizes the torture chamber of the killing.  At the start of the film Gibson quotes Isaiah 53: ""By his wounds we are healed"". At the end of this film, we are as transgressed as Christ but hardly healed.Take away the slow-mo close-ups of violence, what is left of ""The Passion"" is very simple: a tale of a distraught mother, an adrogynous-looking Satan, and a sympathetic Pilate -- a more conventional movie than the reviews would allow.  As some will argue, the result is well-meaning -- certainly watchable (for all it's brutalities), but it's very hard to see it as spiritual or moral manna to anyone."	3.0	Blood, blood and more blood...	2004-12-13	9	5	4

I already owned the original DVD release, but I heard this had lots of special features and the re-cut version.  Therefore I purchased this edition.  However, I was a bit disappointed.I really enjoyed the movie in the theater.  It tells the story of the last 12 hours of the life of christ.  It was very gory and I wouldn't want to show it to children.  However, for older people (12 yrs. and up)this does a good job of depicting the trials and tribulations of Christ's crucifiction.My biggest complaint about this movie was the subtitles.  However, if you are familiar with the Biblical story, you can pretty much ignore the dialogue and focus on the picture.Now for this ""Definitive Edition"" Special feature wise this is a great edition to have.  It has loads of extra features.My biggest complaint about this edition was that if you are a person like me who sometimes has to take several different times (starting and stopping) to watch a movie in it's entirety, the chapter selections are a wonderful thing.  You can stop where you need to and start back just by selecting the scene you were on.  However, with the definitive edition the scene selection is done with approximately 10 chapters.  The chapters are set up to coincide with the ""stations of the cross.""  Although a good idea if you are Catholic and want to see those stages but for a normal viewer of this movie it was terribly frustrating.  The first chapter runs for over an hour.  I usually don't have that long to watch so I have to start all over each time and use fast forward to get to where I was.  It was just very irritating.I really liked the fact that they included the re-cut version of the film as well as the original.  If you are unfamiliar with the re-cut version, it essentially is a ""less graphic"" version of the film (although it is still very violent).  This version may be better for a church library or a family with younger children.If you like special features and want the less gory version of the Passion then by all means purchase this edition.  However, if you prefer to be able to stop and start or jump to a certain scene of the movie then go with the original release (it has approx. 32 scene chapters)."	3.0	Review for the Definitive Edition	2007-02-23	244	209	35

I have Jewish acquaintances who saw it only to seek out negative things that could be used as anti-jewish even though there was nothing of that sort on this film. The Jewish community remarked that it would stir up an old hatred towards Jews. Again, there was not anything like that in the film. If there is any hatred or resentment towards Jews, no one needs this film to conjur up those feelings. If people resent the Jews, it is due to their conduct in these current times, not in ancient times.	5.0	Too Much Negative Controversy For Nothing...	2004-09-02	12	6	6

One exclaimed that this movie was the biggest marketing ploy ever.  The other stated emphatically, ""I'm not going to see it, that's for sure!""It's hard to rate this movie.  I'm not sure which aspect to rate.  Was it entertaining?  Not really.  But it was artistic and consistent.  Gibson could have Hollywoodized this by inserting politically correct subtleties.  (Hollywood loves to marginalize Christ's claims to being the Son of God, Redeemer, etc.)  Gibson stuck to his guns.  The characters from this real-life story were consistent from the first scene to the last.  That quick last shot (the Resurrection) made my heart skip.  Very well done.I think Mel Gibson joins the ranks of gutsy directors like Spike Lee for communicating a vision that comes from personal conviction and never swerving.  I've always appreciated Spike Lee's compelling work, and (as a white guy) how it always compels me to think and feel and reevaluate my beliefs.  Gibson has performed a similar feat.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	I just had a few miscellaneous comments on a film that has already sparked a good deal of controversy.This was destined to be a controversial film right from the start, with the concerns ranging from whether it was too violent to whether it was anti-Semitic. Well, to address the first concern, you can't have a successful movie these days without a lot of gratuitous sex, drugs, and violence, and since this is 2000 years ago and there weren't that many recreational drugs back then, they probably had to step up the violence quotient a bit to compensate, although I suspect people had sex back then, too. It just wasn't the object of as much existential angst, and AIDS was 2000 years in the future, so there were certain advantages to living in ancient times, even if you couldn't run down to the corner store and get a cold sixpack at 2 am in the morning.But getting back to the movie, this is certainly a powerful and evocative depiction of the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, and the entire cast really is superb. Although I usually don't like going to movies with subtitles, I didn't mind it in this case since Aramaic was the language of Jesus and it was interesting to hear it spoken, as I've only seen it written up to this point and had never heard it. A little piece of trivia here--classical Aramaic was thought by linguists to be another dead Semitic language (like Akkadian, Assyrian, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Punic, Coptic, Ammonite, Moabite, and the classical Arabic of the Koran, and Hebrew was dead until they brought it back), until an obscure congregation in Egypt and several other communities were found to be using it some years ago, although it was a more modern dialect. So I liked that aspect of the movie although I doubt I'll be trying to learn any dead Semitic languages anytime soon.The movie was indeed pretty violent, but ancient times certainly have no monopoly on violence compared to modern times, and more people died during the massive world wars and many smaller wars, genocides, purges, revolutions, and various other social conflagrations of the 20th century (which was at least 100 million people) than were probably even alive 2000 years ago. I also didn't find the movie anti-Semitic, and if the Jews hadn't killed Jesus some other group probably would have.So despite the controversial elements, overall, I think this was a well-done movie whose good points outweigh its bad points, and whatever the final critical judgment on it is, I'm sure the movie will be hotly debated and discussed for many years to come.	5.0	A few comments	2004-02-26	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1R283L4SH4UP8	Magpie	I thought this film was very good. Mel Gibson succeeded in what he was attempting to do, which was not to tell the life story of Jesus but to portray his last 12 hours on Earth. These last 12 hours are interspersed with stream-of-consciousness flashbacks (The Sermon On The Mount, The Last Supper, etc, etc) to allow many of the events to be placed in some form of context. Again, Gibson succeeds at what he's attempting. All of the performances are excellent. The only scene that took me out of the film was the scene with Herod; which although may be historically accurate just came off as Gibson not liking homosexuals too much (see also Braveheart). But this is a minor gripe. I also did not see the movie as anti-Semitic. I believe that if you are already prone to being anti-Semitic, the movie's not going to change your mind, what with the Pharisees and the angry mob demanding Jesus' death. But not all Jews are portrayed as evil. I'm thinking specifically of the common man who helps Jesus carry his cross to Golgotha. In short, this was a small group of people who were demanding his death, I think only a weak-minded individual could find cause to damn an entire race of people because of the actions of a few. Plus, there is the belief that Jesus was to die that day no matter what, it was his destiny to die for our sins. I came away from the film with a deeper belief of that than anything else.I also have to comment on the violence. While I never felt it was gratuitous, I did feel it was the the most realistically brutal and graphic I have ever seen in a film. I am 29 years old, have seen many many brutal violent and controversial films, they still never affected me to the point that this film did. By the crucifixion scene, my stomach was turning and my fingertips were starting to feel a little numb. I have never had a physical reaction to a film like that before. Again, Gibson succeeds. The issue I have is that this film is rated R. Not NC-17 or even Unrated. I don't know how this movie got released with an R, but I have my guesses (mainly influence, money, or just plain subject matter; meaning the MPAA was not going to give a Jesus movie an NC-17). In any case, releasing this movie with an R rating was wrong, and it shows how the MPAA does not have a single clue what they're doing. If a film is sexually explicit, it will receive an NC-17. The MPAA however does not seem to have an issue with graphic violence. I think this is just part of the reason why our American culture is morally bankrupt, since our culture dictates the rules set by the MPAA. The violence in this film would be traumatizing for a child or even young teenager, yet if a parent wants, they can accompany their child to this movie. If it was NC-17 or Unrated, anyone under 18 could not get in, period. This is not a movie for children, this is strictly a film for adults who have the ability to take the violence they're seeing and place it in a context of the rest of Jesus' story. Even then, I know of adults who have seen this film who have had trouble sleeping afterwards for days.Finally, the reason I don't give this film 5 stars is simply from a film standpoint, it feels unfinished. Again, I know that this was Gibson's goal, to re-create the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. But it feels like a 10-hour,  5 DVD long movie exists and I put in the 5th DVD in first to watch. The movie is so authentic looking, so powerful and so hypnotic, it makes me wish Gibson had, or would make a mini-series (only aired on pay cable obviously) of Jesus' entire life. I think THAT would be excellent.	4.0	Mel Gibson's passion	2004-03-05	3	1	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	"After watching The Passion of the Christ, I was compelled to go back and read the Gospels, something that I had not done since Catholic School.  It was that stirring and important a film for me.  But getting to the theater to see it, ironically, was a bit of a passion, in and of itself, for me.  Feeding off media accounts that described the film as brutal, violent, and horrific--Roger Ebert called it the most violent film he had ever seen--my interest in the story clashed against a visceral desire to avoid sitting through two hours of gore.  Why, I thought, should I put myself through that?  And then I started dreaming about the film, about the issue of whether I should see it or not, and it became more and more apparent that I had to do so.  After three weeks, I overcame my fear and anxiety and, with the help of friends, spent Friday night watching it in the nicest theater I could find.Mind you, I'm not a churchgoer; my relationship with God is very personal and private.  But, even during my agnostic  youth, I've always been moved by Jesus and many of his teachings.  And I'm certainly not a Roman Catholic anymore, for reasons that my other reviews ought to make clear.  But the story of Jesus is not about denominations.When I got to the theater, there was an odd juxtaposition of all the screaming, laughing kids going to see Hollywood mainstream entertainment my own nervous anticipation.  It struck me how divorced many young people are from the story of the Passion, and, indeed, all religion.  And as I sat waiting for the film to begin, I steeled my nerves and awaited the carnage.Now maybe I've watched too many news programs and Arnold Schwartzenegger films, but the Passion simply wasn't as brutal as the reviews  had suggested.  Sure, it is hard to watch at times, but we have become so numbed to brutality--at least I have--that I was not overwhelmed by it.  My reaction was that I was watching something that awful people do with disturbing frequency around the world.  It brought to mind the poor souls who were tortured in Iraqi jails or by intelligence agents of ostensibly modern countries, the young children raped and brutalized by pedophiles, the women raped and mutilated everywhere.  The brutality in Passion, however, was presented with such power and lyricism, that I found myself in tears through much of the movie.  I found myself filled with compassion and shame for what the human race had done to such a kind and wonderful man.  And isn't that what the story of the Passion is all about?This movie probably is not for people thirteen or younger.  I did not bring my own thirteen-year-old, but not because of the violence.  I told him that he had to read the Gospels first, become familiar with the story, talk to me about it.  (I can count on one hand the number of times he's been to church, and we have never read The New Testament together.  But the Passion has inspired me to read the Gospels with him.)Sadly, I feel compelled to answer the charges of anti-semitism that have swirled around this movie for years.  It isn't anti-semitic.  Not in the least.  These charges are false arguments that really go to displeasure over the nature of the Gospels, not Mel Gibson's movie.  Indeed, the Gospels paint in a bad light--a very, very bad light--the religious aristocracy of the time.  They are painted as materialistic, power-hungry, and sordid, no different than most church aristocracies.  That they behaved in a blood-thirsty, sanctimonious manner (demanding death for ""blasphemy"") was not only typical for the times, but is consistent with how many churches have behaved.  How many Roman Catholics died based upon charges of blasphemy, after all?  That these awful people were Jewish, well, that's just happens to be the Gospel story.  And to the claim, false of course, that the Jews in the film were depicted badly, that's simply selective nonsense.  All of the good characters in this movie happen to be Jewish as well, even those who do not join Christ or abandon Judaism.  Indeed, on his way to the cross, many Jewish people are weeping over the inhumanity of Jesus' torture and death.  But why the charges of anti-semitism then?  Fear, mostly.  Fear that ignorant people will, again, use the story of the Passion as an excuse to inflict evil on Jews.  That is a reasonable fear, given history.  But it cannot justify the suppression or criticism of a core event in Christianity, in my opinion.  And the rabid outcry of the film's detractors has only increased the chances of madmen using the story of the Passion in evil ways.I loved this film, as you can probably tell.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1CYZPDN4TUDSE	Mannuel	I found the Pope's quote about this film to be the perfect title for my review. I found that I didnt need to read the subtitles half of the time because the story line was exactly what I learned in Catholic School. I love the fact that this movie was only about the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ, I find that every other movie just crams the life of the most famous man that ever walked this earth...in 2 hours, leaves alot of detail out.There is not one thing that I didnt like about this movie, the story-line, the picture, the acting, the settings, everything! It's like the perfect recepie for a 5 star film.The Passion of Christ will always be controversy and will give much to talk about, that if the Jews this, that if the Romans that, that if the Catholics...and so on and so fourth. One has to accept that this is how history happened (IF this is the real story, reading about the Holy Grail, the Nights of Templar and the Priory of Sion has made me consider that there might be something else out there that we dont know). And with all do respect the Jewish community has to take a chill-pill and get over things, yes, they judged Jesus, what can they do now? Nothing!!! Do people judge them for that? No. Was this film made to attack Jews? I highly doubt that.Before you post a review about this film you must see it for what it is, and accept it as the recount of a part of history that is important to everyone. Think of it as a piece of cinematography rather than a visit to Church and you might see that its not as controversial as everyone is making it to be.	5.0	"""It was, as it was"" John Paul II"	2004-03-03	4	1	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2LJRWHKMWJ9P	Maori	"I don't want to give this movie even one star. This movie to me is nothing more than blatant pornography in the form of violence instead of sex.  It's Mel Gibson's vision of what happened to Jesus, not the Bible's.  Most Christians need to get out their dusty Bibles and read the truth not go to this movie.  The Bible states not to add anything to it, but Mel did.  Since this movie Mel is no longer one of my favorite actors.  His comments about the movie in reviews also sickened me.  Gibson told the New Yorker he wanted to ""kill"" New York Times columnist Frank Rich (and his dog) for writing a critical column. ""I want to kill him. I want his intestines on a stick.""In a 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson said women should not become priests. One of his proffered reasons was the fact that a female business partner of his was a ""c--t.""Does this sound like someone who is religious and God fearing?  It sounds like someone who's into violence though.He added: ""Feminists don't like me, and I don't like them. I don't get their point.""Gibson has made similar crude remarks about gays.In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gibson said Catholics will get to heaven much faster than those of other denominations and faiths.Thanks, but no thanks, I'll pass on anymore Mel movies."	1.0	"No passion for ""The Passion"" or Mel Gibson"	2004-09-03	42	19	23

The special effects bring the Passion of Jesus to life, so real they enduce cringes and outpourings of sympathy.

What with growing up in an age where one's senses become so jaded from an oversaturization of media and from a disheartening desensitization to violence, sex, and profanity, it sadly (but thankfully) took a Hollywood blockbuster movie to help me realise that God was not only losing His only Son, but losing Him in the most painfull way possible.

I don't think this film is for me at all, but for those who have yet to know him.One thing I do know is that, Jesus did indeed suffer the death so graphically depicted in the film and I applaud Mel Gibson's passion for preserving the authenticity and historicity of the times and events.One can't be expected to leave the theatre with admiration for the acting or the cinematography. Neither would the sound track or costumes cause viewers to marvel - as excellent as they were. No all these things are eclipsed by the 'Message' of the film.My hope is that , what happened in the film gives rise to the more important question of WHY it happened and many more people experience the rich and fulfilling life true Christianity brings.	4.0	Watch this if you dare!	2005-02-12	6	1	5

For a believer, seeing this movie is like watching the person you love most in the world sacrificing himself to replace your sins with his love. The symbols of satan and temptation are presented in the form of serpent,woman,children,woman,and flies (Beelzebub means, Lord of the Flies).The film artfully presents the Passion of the Christ in a manner not unlike a Dali painting. The symbols are there but unexplained. For example, the cup on the cross of the goodthief,a symbol that he will be feasting with Jesus in Paradise that day. The film is rich in imagery and Christian symbol that most non believers will not understand or appreciate. This movie is going to be repulsive to many who can't appreciate the symbols, a masterpiece for those who can connect with their faith and know what they are seeing in detail.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2IZQJJGG00SGV	Marduk Alkhas	"A readers' point of view is always a determinant in the perception of any communication text. But in the case of Mel Gibson's ""Passion,"" the viewer's values and beliefs could be detrimental. Clearly in making of the film, Gibson was being true to his own deeply felt and held values and beliefs and therefore indisputably his ""Passion"" is a work of art-maybe we should add, as Tolstoy defines ""art."" Gibson is sharing his profound feelings without compromising for commercial gains or appearing fair and balanced to viewers who do not share the same values and beliefs, and his honesty and commitment comes across loud, clear, and boldly. Another significant attribute of the film is that its form is closer to painting or music rather than to literature. Gibson primary focus is on the impression his film leaves on the audience rather than how the kernels in the narrative structure fit. Like a painter and composer he leads the viewer to conjure the story and its ideological themes and to realize that the depth of the message is beyond the linear chain of the events that construe the story.The events from the gospels depicted in the film are appropriately chosen for the effect Gibson intends. The casting is remarkable-all the actors displaying the mythical iconic look associated with their character. The flaws in the text are minor, and most likely felt because Gibson raises our expectation. Personally, I felt the pace and rhythm was uneven, as if the music here and there failed to flow harmoniously. Certain scenes move too slow and are stretched providing more where less would have enhanced the persuasive power. And I wished there was less emphasis on theatre and more on cinema, less on the composition and staging of the scenes and more on montage. However, I understand this is a film by Gibson, and I have to accept it as such. Yet, I need to state that my wish is not simply my personal idiosyncrasy, but it rises from the fact that I am a serious student of cinema.""Passion"" is a remarkable achievement. Gibson reveals he understands well that faith is a matter of belief and feelings, rather than science and logic, thus his dialectics is concerned with the universal values of Christ teachings than on the issue of His deity. As far as the issue of controversy surrounding this film, it simply makes no sense. There is no controversy here. Those who are offended by the content of the film are actually in defiance of the gospels. This is Gibson painting and singing the Gospels, accurately, truly, and with all his passion. And finally, I would like to add that I am an Assyrian and Aramaic is my mother language. Far from being a scholar, but I do speak and read the new and old Aramaic language, and still think in Aramaic. Yet, it was very difficult for me to understand the dialogue. When I was able to distinguish a word here and there, I found it heavily accented and often mispronounced."	5.0	Gibson paints and sings the Gospels	2004-09-21	4	0	4

Gibson captures perfectly the sentiment that the ""Christ should suffer and die"" (the Gospel according to Luke). And for who? All of us. One cannot expect to appreciate this movie if all one wants is a good flick. This film challenges Christians and non-Christians alike to reflect on the sufferings of Christ.As an aside, I would not take small children to this film (in fact, the crucifixion scenes in most films are too much for small children). And I would recommend that viewers read one of the gospels, if not all of the gospels, before viewing it.

It also foreshadows the creation of the TRUE Church of Christ (the Catholic Church) and the first papal position held by St. Peter.  (...).The movie was perfect in the fact that it shared with the world the true suffering of Christ.  These days, many people paint a rosy picture of the Last Supper and even show the crucifixion of Christ as an event with little to no blood and gore.  We see more blood on a night of ""Family TV"" than what existed here in this movie.  Is it any different that it's JESUS' blood instead of some guy on CSI's blood?

I wasn't prepared for the emotion ""punch in the gut"" that it deliveredThere were times when it took every fibre of my being not to cry my eyes out like some little child. As I sat transfixed in my seat, as the movie unfolded, the enormity of what this Man and his sacrifice entailed was almost too much to bear.I would respectfully disagree with those critics and viewers who felt the magnitude of the bloodshed and violence in this movie was excessive.I can recall the biblical films from my youth - The Greatest Story Ever Told, King of Kings - which depicted the last week of His life and particularily the crucifixion in a relatively ""antiseptic"" fashion. And while I thoroughly enjoyed these films, they never really had a signicant emotional impact on me - not even as a child.!And I think this was exactly what Mel was trying to get at with The Passion of The Christ. I really think he's saying "" Look people - this is what this Man endured for you and I"". I think Mel really wanted to try and show us in as much graphic detail as possible how much this Man suffered for us and our sins.!I think the exact SAME technique was employed so successfully by Speilberg during the filming of Saving Private Ryan. There have been many, many movies which told the story of the allies landing at Normandy. But I cannot recall a single cinematic instance where the violence that must have taken place there was depicted so graphically as it was in this film.I also loved the fact that The Passion of The Christ was done entirely in Arameic, which is such a beautiful sounding language. Whiel I am normally not the biggest fan of subtitles, I confess that I rarely even noticed them in this film. It merely provided this epic picture with a measure of authenticity that every previous biblical epic lacked.There has been some mild criticism about the ""artistic license"" which Mel took in depicting ""Satan"" throughout this film. Well, frankly I thought it was done very, very well. In fact, I think one of the more powerful scenes in the movie occured at the end - after Christ uttered ""it is finished"" on the cross and died - and we see the scene of Satan screaming as he realizes that Death and Sin have been conquered by this Man. Right then and there - Satan lost!! And he's been sighting an uphill and losing battle ever since.!I enjoyed this movie on many levels - powerful performances and brilliant direction.But ultimately it's the story that is so powerful and so moving.It truly is the greatest story ever told..!!"	5.0	Stunning Masterpiece By Mel Gibson	2005-04-04	17	11	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ANLN70A83RI9X	mark	just saw the Passion, and first let me say that I have never bothered to review a movie on a forum like this before. Having said that, this movie was extrordinary. It was graphic, at times brutal, but remember the point of this movie, the crucifiction of Christ...enough said. As for the much overplayed charge of anti-semitism, only those who go to the movie looking for such, will see it in the film, and those same individuals will have missed the entire message of the movie. The Jews didn't kill Jesus, we ALL did, because of our sins.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A10CPBKZKVR0SU	"Mark McMenamin ""chronophile"""	This film had an impact on me like no other. I was literally shaken. I try to live as a devout Catholic Christian, but this book brought home the seriousness of Jesus Christ's mission like nothing previous, with the possible exception of the superb translation of the Gospels in the New American Bible (Catholic). The demonic forces as portrayed by Gibson represent a reality that is foreign to modern sensibilites, but nonetheless real. We ignore this at our peril.Is the film Anti-Semitic? Hardly, and saying so is a red herring that could distract attention from the real issues. Jew or Greek, we all have a common humanity, a common sinfulness, and common (supernatural) enemies. Recall that the first leaders of the Christian Church were virtually all Jews.Say Gibson, how about a sequel on the Acts of the Apostles to Revelation? Give it lots of love and really pull out the stops when John takes his nap on Patmos. This could be a welcome antidote to Left Behind mania.	5.0	Suffering and Redemption	2004-09-01	8	7	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A17BUUBOU0598B	"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies"""	"This movie is the lastest in a long line of ""Passion Plays"" and Films created about the final hours of the life of the man known as Jesus.  It comes at a time in history when the Western world is becoming more secular and religion is becoming more and more of a taboo.  Because of these reasons, this movie has been portrayed in a most unfortunate light.Even if you are not religious, this is one of the most important stories ever told, and one of the most incredible uses of film.  It draws on historical first hand accounts and tells the story of the murder of a man who went against those in power and tried to spread the message of love.  Modern film has advanced to a point where the torture he endured can be accurately portrayed on film.  Don't let the violence blind you to the point of this film, that this man had a vision and was willing to withstand any pain in order to share it with the world.Mel Gibson has said that he drew from the eyewitness accounts collected in the Bible's New Testament, as well as the diaries of the Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich as collected in her book, 'The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ'.  Even if you are not a Catholic or a Cristian, everything in this movie has been supported as historically accurate by many secular academics.  It also draws from films such as ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and others.The film was made with an eye towards accuracy and its realism is often difficult to watch because of the tortures Jesus endures.  All of the visual imagery serves a purpose, and shows us realistically just how much pain Jesus was willing to go through to fulfil what he saw as his destiny.The dialogue is in Latin, Aramaic and Hebrew with english subtitles.  Contrary to what other reviewers have suggested, these are not ""dead"" languages just yet, though aramaic and latin are only spoken in small enclaves of the world.  There are still populations that grow up speaking off-shoots of these languages.  I applaud the film-maker for boldly attempting to film this in the original languages of the time period portrayed.  The actors do wonderful jobs in these languages, a difficult task indeed.The film is also a masterpiece of cinematography. This wide screen edition of the DVD finally allows the home viewer to see the film done justice.  I've seen the movie several times and the wide screen DVD better captures the power of watching the film in a theatre than the VHS or regular format DVD.The scenery and sets are also impressive. No expense was spared in bringing the film-makers vision to life.Yet all of these incredible elements are trumped by superb directing and acting.  Caveziel gives us what is in my humble opinion the best portrayal of Jesus to date.  I am not a Jesus scholar, but I have seen a lot of movies like this.  These performances are impressive.This film will not be appropriate for small children or those with thin skin.  Whatever your personal feelings or beliefs are, this movie is a landmark of history being told through film.  Watch it and let us all learn from it so that this history will never be repeated!"	5.0	History Brought to Life, an Incredible Story, a Great Film!!	2004-08-30	8	7	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2DAHERP7HYJGO	Mark Turner	THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is perhaps the most talked about movie in the history of film. Other films have been condemned, discussed, dissected and more. But this film has received more anger ridden controversy than the last movie about Christ to do so, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. And is the controversy worth noting? Perhaps. But some of it is nothing more than the rants of people who never saw the film. The film does deserve to be seen and discussed.For anyone living in a cave over the past few years, the movie focuses on the last day in the life of Jesus Christ (Jim Caviezel). It opens with his praying on his last night in the garden and moves quickly forward to his betrayal by Judas and subsequent torture and persecution by anyone with power at the time.A sect of Jews led by Caiphas found Jesus to be a threat to their power base. In response, they set out to have him destroyed. More than destroying his following, they actually wanted him wiped off of the face of the Earth. And they set out to do so. This has caused some to consider the film anti-Semitic. The fact of the matter was there were two choices of the people involved to crucify Christ at that time: the Jewish leaders or the Roman leaders. History has shown that it was the Jewish leaders that called for his demise. Plus the fact is that Jesus himself was a Jew. It is not anti-Semitic to state this. It is merely history. And for those who believe, there was no other option for those leaders if God's plan was to be followed through.The movie proceeds to show the physical persecution of Jesus from there forward. When he is arrested and transported to the temple, he is beaten with the chains that bind him. When he is in the temple and accused, he is beaten by the mob. All of this is disturbing in its own right. But things get progressively worse.Taken to Pilate so that he might put Jesus to death, Pilate opts for the political ploy of sending him to Herod, the king of Jesus land of birth, to judge him. Herod sends him back. Pilate caves but not completely, ordering Jesus to be punished but not put to death. And this is where the truly brutal point of the film begins.Jesus is taken to the guards for scourging. For those who do not know, this is when Jesus was beaten. Many times we have heard about Jesus being whipped, lashed or beaten. But never has it been this graphically portrayed. The guards taunt Jesus and are presented as sadistic oafs. They begin with reed like canes and when that doesn't offer enough damage, when Jesus continues to rise, they switch to a cat-o-nine tails type whip, tipped with pieces of glass. These cut into Jesus' flesh, ripping him apart like so much meat. When finished, the stones surrounding Jesus are covered in blood.Throughout the grueling punishment that Jesus receives, his mother Mary is witness. She sees the torturous treatment that her son receives. She sees the pain and anguish he is going through. And she conveys on her face the pain that she is suffering along with him.Near death, Jesus is once again taken to Pilate. Still unwilling to condemn this man to death, he turns the matter over to the people who call out for his demise. Broken and bloodied, Jesus is forced to carry his own cross to be crucified on. Shredded beyond belief, he does so, faltering several times along the way, at one point requiring assistance.The final act of the film offers perhaps the most realistic glimpse of what those who were crucified had to endure. It is painful to watch. Director Mel Gibson never lets go of the viewer's throat, forcing you to witness the pain that Jesus, Gibson's representation of God on Earth, went through. And it leaves you wasted by the film's end.There is no way that a person of faith, a person who believes in God and Jesus can walk away from this film untouched. The images are seared into your mind. Although I do not attend church, I believe in God and Jesus. And as I watched, beginning with the scourging, I found myself crying. Sure I had heard that people were doing this. I was prepared to control myself while watching. But as the film progressed, I cried several times, unable to stop and never feeling ashamed of it. This movie can affect you as strongly as this.From a technical standpoint, the movie is very well made. The photography is well done, the story told plainly and simply and the direction done so as to not make you notice. It was Gibson's passion with his belief in Christ that made this film a reality. He has taken much heat from the Hollywood community for bringing his vision to life. It has been said that he may never work in Hollywood again. If that were possible, it would be their loss, not his.The movie opened big, making more money than anyone could ever have expected by a movie of this sort of topic. It caused more discussion of religion and belief than any movie that I can ever recall. And perhaps, even though he has suffered the slings and arrows of an impartial press and industry, perhaps it was worth it. Because at the end of the day, Gibson was able to make people think once again about God. And that is an accomplishment in itself.I highly recommend that everyone see this film. It will touch you no matter what you believe. If it doesn't, then you have no feelings inside.	5.0	YES, IT IS A DEVESTATING EXPERIENCE	2008-03-15	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AIFNOZKR9WTYI	"mark twain ""25354"""	"(...) Inspirational, it isn't.  I mean they really had the guy on the ropes.  Well, actually, maybe it is inspiring.  I mean I get worked over so bad on the basis daily that it really kind of cheers me up to see somebody getting worked over much worse.Of course it kind of interferes with one's ability to take the movie seriously that the characters behave with such vaudevillian exaggeration that they seem to be playing to a gallery of nine-year-olds.  Subtle the Israelites were not, apparently.  And then there's the fact that the entire action of the movie is Jesus getting messed up.  Its like a movie that consists of one, very protracted, very one-sided, fight scene.  An action movie of the most lugubrious sort.But the real question every Christian needs to ask themselves is, would they have followed Jesus if they had been around him at that time and place?  I'm guessing the answer is no.  As for Smell Gibson, I think he needs to stop taking himself so seriously and let somebody else have a crack at it.  This is really just a B movie that you seem to walk into the middle of.  Why no teachings of Jesus?  Why no childhood of Jesus?  Because, my friend, that simply is not good box office.  Whaddre we making here, some kind of chick flick?  No, lets get right to the gory part and stay there.  Can't miss.  See, its not really important what Jesus actually taught, its just important that he got worked over real bad. Why?  Because no teenager is gonna go see a Bible movie unless its full of violence.  Smell Gibson, if he were present at the time of Christ, would have been selling tickets to the crucifixion. It is impossible to deny, because that is precisely what he is doing here.  What was that Jesus said, ""It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven""?  Oh, I forgot, lets not obsess on what Jesus may or may not have said.  Lets just get some popcorn and a couple of big gulps that we smuggled in from 7-11 and enjoy the splatterfest.addition 9-05-04: The problem with Christianity, said G.K. Chesterton, was not that it has been tried and found wanting, but that it has been found difficult and left untried.  Let me repeat that.  It has been found difficult and left untried.  Found DIFFICULT AND LEFT UNTRIED.  Am I getting through to you now?  Nobody is actually following Christ's teachings because this is a highly inconvenient thing to do.  Jesus said, ""you cannot follow both me and money.""  And yet here we see multimillionaire Smell Gibson coming on all pious.  Jesus said, ""Resist not evil.""  And he walked his talk by getting crucified.  Again, highly inconvenient teachings.  Gee, what to do... uhhh, how about we just pick and choose what we like the sound of and then sort of bandy that stuff around while we collect brownie points for going to church and sitting there like a bump on a log?  Looks like we're all set.Addition 9-10-04:  Consider also, the title of the film.  The Passion of The Christ.  This phraseology is inescapably vulgar.  First, I believe one is supposed to get the wrong idea: ""Yeah, Christ sure was passionate.""  Or, better yet, ""Gee, I didn't know that Jesus got lucky.  Is this a French film?""  Joe Six Pack is supposed to go wandering inno the theater expecting a stag reel.  But lets say the audience gets wised up and then no longer expects a stag film - like right about the time they're driving the nails through his palms.  Then the title becomes a commodification of Christ's crucifixion.  THE Passion of THE Christ.  Any way we could get the word ""the"" inno that title a few more times?  How about ""The Passion of the the the Christ""  Then again maybe we should just buy an album by The The."	1.0	Donde estan los peliculas de snuff?	2004-09-01	37	15	22
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1DZKOOMMJM1MI	"Mark Twain ""Sam"""	"Poetic, beautiful, and extremely violent, The Passion of the Christ is a film to be viewed at least once, whether you end up loving it, or hating it. Either way, this is not entertainment in any sense, it is a brutal, bloody, honest, and passionate film, depicting the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, not his entire life as some people initially believed. It's not an easy viewing experience, difficult to take and at times excruciating. It is a front row seat to the torture, humiliation, and crucifixian of Christ in all it's bloody glory. I found myself turning away quite often, unable to take it. However, I appreciated it.Most people are angry that the film is one torture scene after another, but I saw bravo to Mel Gibson for getting this film made. The people who don't like it are the ones who don't understand it, or maybe, are turned off by all the violence. One of the amazon reviewers felt the film stank because ""it was in French or something"" and the ""soldiers"" are ""wusses."" Is that the kind of reviewer someone should listen to?I don't agree with a lot of Mel Gibson's views, especially his comments on homosexuality, but I have to admire him for financing this and getting it released. This film is an emotional experience that will no doubt linger in the mind long after its viewing. It's not a film I can watch again, but it's a film I cannot imagine not having seen."	5.0	Emotional and Powerful.	2004-07-05	11	5	6

I don't consider my self much of a christian, but I was very moved by this movie.  I found myself coming to tears, and my wife was crying quite a bit.  It's one of those movies that just do something to you, touches you in a way that most movies don't.  We watched it at the theaters on a Sat. night, and I bet I didn't get to sleep until 2 in the morning, I just sat up and thought, and thought, and thought about it.  I actually got on the internet, and did some research about the life of Christ, and finally understood some of the deeper meanings of christian faith.  So like the millions of other people today, I went out and bought the dvd.  But beware, there are absolutely no special features on it.  I guess like everyone else, we'll have to wait for the special edition.  I do recommend people to buy it though, it will touch you in one way or the other, it's impossible not to be moved.	4.0	A truly powerful, moving movie...	2004-08-31	8	6	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A9VLJ9HY9VGLE	Mark W. Chamberlain	"I think the movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" was very well done, it followed the accounts of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ very closely. Of course there were spots that are not recorded in scripture, such as the woman playing the devil making her appearances in the garden and such, but this helps to demonstrate the struggle and suffering Christ went through. And Jesus crushing the head of the snake in the garden was a nice touch that goes along with Genesis 3:15 where God is talking to the serpent and says the seed of the woman (Jesus Christ) will bruise the head of the serpent, demonstrating at the cross how Jesus defeated the Devil. Some also say there was to much violence and it was to graphic. Yes it was graphic but how can you put 12 hours of suffering down to 2 hours, the beating of Christ alone in real life took more then 2 hours. I give Mel Gibson two thumbs up.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AAY1YLTKK4JC7	"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator"""	"Well, this movie is like any other ever made.  Because of its religious nature, it is nearly impossible to judge it simply as some flick to go see.  However, I'll first judge the film on whether or not you should go out and see it in the theatres, then on its movie merits, and I'll conclude with some thoughts on what this movie means theologically.If you are looking for a film to escape into, or looking for great entertainment value, or basically most of the reasons we go to see movies, The Passion is not the movie for you.  Firstly, this film is horrifyingly graphic and violent.  It is an accurate reflection of life as it was.  Outside of the graphic nature of the film, the 100 minutes of cellulite that represents that sum total of Christ's sacrifice is agonizing.  Though Mel Gibson breaks some of this up with flashbacks from Christ's earlier years, it's just so intense that if you don't understand the theology of the film, you won't enjoy this at all.  Simply said, this film was made for Christians that are committed to their faith, not for agnostics, atheists, or the average filmgoer.I don't mean to imply that this film is somehow ""too good"" for atheists, agnostics and non-believers.  I simply mean to state that this film is not attempting to be entertaining, or thought provoking, or anything else.  Christ's teachings are skimmed over, and not really mentioned, the consequences of the crucifixion are not expelled upon.  Simply, this is a portrayal of The Passion of Jesus as He went through what was destined.The merits of the film as a film are not lacking by any stretch of the imagination.  Though the film is based on the Gospels, as a story the life of Christ is far from boring.  Betrayal, skepticism, murder, conspiracy, love, belief, purpose.  All are part of the story of His last day.Similarly, there aren't any plot problems, subplot problems, theme issues, or major holes to speak of.  The accounts of His crucifixion take less than three pages of text per gospel.  As such, simplicity prevents questions of direction and purpose.Mel Gibson directed this film quite well.  The film flows together quite well.  Mel's vision of the last day of Christ is well done.  I am at a lack for words when it comes to describing the thanks I have for Mel Gibson for doing this film in the way he has.  His choice to be the man who nails Christ to the cross is important, and all but avoids silly questions about the anti-Semitic nature of this film.  Gibson's vision of the humiliation and struggle on His last day are awakening.  As a convert from atheism to Christianity, this movie has helped me in ways innumerous.Mel Gibson aside, the acting in The Passion is extraordinary in itself.  The highlights are Hristo Shopov's portrayal of Pontius Pilate.  Also, kudos are needed for Rosalinda Celentano's thankless portrayal of Satan.  Ms. Celetano's performance was visually spectacular .  Finally, James Caviezel gives an unbelievable performance of endurance as Jesus.  These actors deserve a lot of credit for making this film what it is.What is this movie?  An attempt to show the earthly pain that God as Man went through for us, all of humanity.  He carried our sins, the sins of all Mankind in an ongoing sacrifice.  That burden is incomprehensible to us as humans, but we get a taste of it here in this film.  Thank you Mel Gibson."	5.0	.....&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;speechless>>>>......	2004-02-29	1	1	0

Every actor searches for a role that will define his skills and be a part of his being.  The role of Jesus will be such a role for James Caviezel. This is a movie that causes us to look at the history of the time and how politics, greed, and fear combine to create suffering for an innocent Jesus.  Whether one is a believer or not, one has to look at the screen as a canvas where Mel Gibson as an artist uses Caviezel as his instrument to create a masterpiece.  It causes one to be humble in the presence of such power and glory.  Thank You Mel and Thank You James for sharing your commitment and passion with the world.

Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece here, and has reminded all who have seen it the suffering that Jesus endured in order to show mankind the way into Heaven. This depiction of the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus is extremely brutal and violent, especially the scourging of Christ, which is one of the most gruesome scenes in a movie that I have ever seen. The violence only serves, once again, to remind us what Jesus endured to wipe the slate clean for mankind. While definitely not for little kids or anybody under 13, everybody should see this film for a 126-minute reminder of who it was that sent His son to die for us, and who it was that died to show us the way into Heaven.	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-02-28	6	5	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	The Passion of Christ is something that has been in the making for a while. It is directed by Mel Gibson who invested $30 million of his own money to do it. I respect his passion in making the passion, he needed to do somethings differently though.The Passion of Christ is really about the beating of Christ. Never before in any movie have we seen one man take such a punishment. When Christ gets scourged by the roman soldiers it was the most intense scene i've ever seen since Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. They scourged him to bad. The cuts they put on him would have made a man bleed to death. The march to Calvary with his cross was also a painful sight to watch. You continue to see him get beat brutally and the crowd throws stones at him. It was to long and those two scenes take up over an hour worth of filming. The crucifiction is also very intense. When they rip is shoulder out of place to stretch him on the cross so they can keep nailing him to it I cringed bad. I don't ever remember cringing like that. You see the nails go in him and you see the blood squirt out with each hit. It's rather intense and in my opinion way to much.The scariest aspect the movie didn't relate to is that the beating and Jesus dying on the cross was nothing to what he suffered in the garden. He sweat blood from all of his pores. In angel of the lord came to give him comfort and yet it still didn't. They show a little bit in the beginning, but you never get the idea in the movie that this man just atoned for the sins of the whole world. It's the sacrifice that Jesus made in the garden that has made it possible for us to live with him again.I didn't like how they put Satan in the movie. Never does it say anywhere in the gospels that Satan was there. It doesn't say he wasn't there, but he wasn't needed in the movie. He doesn't add anything to it except for a big creep factor to it. You don't want to be creeped out while witnessing a beating like the one Jesus gets. I could have done without so much Mary, but it was made by Cathloics and they have their own beliefs. I respect that and Mel Gibson did a good job of not trying to throw his ideas of religon at you. There was some Hollywood in the movie, but it is accurate.The movie was made well. The costumes look fantastic. The sets look great as well. They speak Hebrew and Latin and you get English subtitles. It adds to the movie well and it wouldn't be nearly as good without it.All the actors are great. A perfect cast was made for the movie. Jim Cavaziel is great as Jesus. He's very sincere with the part and he took it very serious. Everybody on the set did. I have a lot of respect for Jim. He did get scourged a couple of times and he did seperate his shoulder carrying the cross. He got hypothermia a couple of times as well. He lived the part. He wanted it to be great and his performance is.The movie really is pretty good. It does make you think about the sacrifice that Jesus made for us. They just made it to intense. Jesus did so much for us in his life. He had so many sermons and did so much. He loved us that he atoned our sins and gave his life for us. We should remember him more for his loving acts,not a big gigantic beating.The movie is intense and brutal. There were barely any dry eyes in our theater here. It definetly makes you think about what was done for us. It's not a jew bashing movie and it doesn't throw religon down your througt. It's not a movie for a younger audience, but it's definetly something that should be seen.If your going to learn about the last few hours of Christs life go to church and read your bible. Pray about it. The movie is a good teaching tool, and I'm glad it was made.	4.0	It's one of the most intense movies i've ever seen.	2004-02-25	4	3	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O	"Matthew Higdon ""California Chariot"""	"Strong cast; authentic feel, both linguistically and culturally; backed by a reflective and very moody soundtrack -- THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is probably the most powerful - and gruesome - cinematic depiction of the obedient sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of Israel and the world. Gibson has done a fine, if imperfect, job of reimagining the final hours of Christ's life.The picture opens in the Garden of Gethsemane with Yeshua/Jesus (Jim Caviezel) praying, agonizing before the Father about what must happen next. A detachment of soldiers - led by Judas son of Simon Iscariot - arrives to arrest Jesus. The party then brings him before Annas and Caiaphas, some of the Sanhedrin, and finally Pilate who, following a very bloody scourging, gives in and hands him over to be crucified. (I especially appreciate the attempt to represent Pilate's own situation.) Jesus, mocked by many and abandoned by even his closest followers, forgives his executioners - a unique response to one's torturers when compared to the responses found in certain intertestamental martyrological texts, such as 2 Maccabees 7 and 4 Maccabees 9-12. The film makes interesting spiritual connections, periodically showing Satan to be tempting Jesus to ""call it off"" (even though I think the Gospels suggest demonic forces may have been trying to get Jesus killed - e.g. Luke 22:53; John 13:27-30). Following death, Jesus is lowered from the cross and prepared for burial, which process is not shown. Less than one minute of screen time is devoted to the Resurrection - the movie's final scene - in which the stone rolls away, the linen cloths sink to a formless pile, and a very-much-alive Jesus stands and strides out of the tomb.Mr. Gibson has made a bold statement of personal faith - faith not in some societal cause or abstract ideology, but in an individual of the historic past. A statement made despite often enormous unpopularity. Agree with his religious views or not, Mel Gibson is a man of great personal conviction and courage.I do think, the more attention one pays to THE PASSION's characters and their actions, the more clear it becomes that Gibson does not paint the Jewish people with a single brush. There is at least some variety in behavior on the part of the Jews and even the Romans. (It is also worth noting that most people who grow up ""in the church"" understand that someone professing similar faith who wants to 'tell the story' on film does so NOT because he/she is anti-Semitic, but because he/she wants to be true to those biblical accounts.) On that note, I would have tried to cast more Middle-Eastern-looking persons for the role of Jesus and perhaps other Jews, to give it an even greater measure of authenticity.I would also have liked to see something in the way of special features on the DVD: the Making of the Passion, theatrical trailers, and the like (in fairness, however, Gibson may not have had the budget for all of that).For what it is, the movie serves as an intelligent and unapologetic portrayal with solid performances all around, especially by Caviezel. And ultimately, for the Christian, the tale of Yeshua's suffering and subsequent glorification - and all they involve - remains the most worthy-to-be-told story of this era ... and this film one of the most culturally and cross-culturally potent tools for evangelism I have ever seen or heard about."	4.0	"Mel's ""Passion"""	2004-11-15	2	0	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ANWO7TBRL50FU	Matthew K. Putnam	"Seeing as this is required when reviewing this movie I'll get this out of the way. I have no religious beliefs. Now that that is out of the way on to my review.When I first saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" I didn't like it. I felt it was too long and boring. The violence didn't bother me so much I just wanted it to end. I decided to give it another shot and this time I liked it a little bit better. So when it came out on DVD I decided to pick it up.It is widely reported that Mel Gibson's original intent was show this movie without subtitles letting the image speak for itself. So I decided to watch it without subtitles. It is painfully obvious that this is how the film should be seen. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is not about the life of Jesus or the teachings of Jesus. It is about his death. In this case Passion meaning suffering. So when you take away the distraction of reading words on screen you focus on what you are seeing and the image becomes that much more powerful.As said before this movie is only about The Passion. It is not about Jesus' life or teachings. Those looking for that story will find it in other films. The best probably being Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" It does help to have a little background on the story.With the aid (or distraction) of subtitles ""The Passion of the Christ"" is long, boring and preachy."" Without them it is a visual experience like no other and the best movie about Jesus Christ ever.The DVD comes in a bare bones release with no extra features. What it lacks in special features it more then makes up for them in the audio and visual department. This is reference quality material and a must buy for home theatre buffs."	5.0	Watch it without subtitles	2005-08-08	7	3	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but when he is making a serious movie, he knows what he's doing.I thought ""Apocalypto"" was not very good, mainly because of its ridiculous violence and its quite one-dimensional portrayal of an entire culture. What was the point? Mel Gibson seemed to be saying ""boy, these people were violent and wrong.""But this sort of unipolar viewpoint, which did not serve ""Apocalypto"" at all, fits this film to a tee. Gibson is clearly a committed Christian of the Catholic stripe, and he has created pretty much the ultimate cinematic portrayal of the story of Christ's crucifixion. I can't imagine a film which would better indicate the depth of the physical suffering that Jesus of Nazareth must have endured, and the emotional pain this would inflict upon his relatives and best friends.The sets are all very detailed and ring quite true to the period. The actors in lead ""good guy"" roles are perhaps a bit too European looking, but given the film's production in Italy, some of this is forgivable. Either way, people have cast these characters with their own ethnicity for eons, so I'm willing to give that a pass.I kind of wish some of the more mystical elements had been left out. Jesus heals a roman soldier during his capture. Judas is attacked (in his mind at least) by little hobgoblin demon children. Christ is also tempted by Satan - who is played and visualized quite well by a spooky-looking actress, but nonetheless this feels like a bit of a tacked on element, despite mentions in the Gospels at various points. These elements are at worst a minor annoyance, but they strain credulity, which probably runs counter to Gibson's purposes.I guess I would have preferred that the human elements of the story stand on their own, because, frankly, that's all we have access to at this late date. We simply can't trust miracle stories and talk of mystical happenings. We don't have access to them. But by meditating on the human aspects of the story, we have something we can relate to and which may inspire faith in the other, less tangible things. To display them openly is to assume their existence before we are faithful.But this is just my opinion, I suppose, based on my reading, studies in philosophy, and my general skeptical bent. I've never seen a miracle, and no one I've trusted has ever reported one to me. Things handed down from 2000 years ago, re-translated dozens of times, do not strike me as reliable sources for amazing stories, none of which seem to happen in modern history and with the benefit of all the technology we have available to us to record such events. I mean, given all the cell phone cameras out there, where are all the indubitable miracles?Anyhow, I digress (my apologies to David Hume...). Even with its mystical trappings, this film in its immediacy and its viscerality certainly succeeds in forcing the viewer to ponder the human aspects. The mystical stuff is a sideshow, so to speak.For those with faith, this film should offer a potent meditation on a story which has been ingrained into the psyche, practically since birth. For a non-believer, this film offers a valuable insight into the passion that believers have for this story and for the man himself. Like a Socrates, Jesus of Nazareth seems to have been a singular man, the like of which is rarely seen. Contemplating this can deepen a non-believer's appreciation, if not deliver them into a completely faithful orientation to the material.To put it briefly, it's a brilliant film. Each shot is lovingly composed, and the visual impact and beauty of the images can't be faulted. The performances all feel very real and there is no actor who takes the viewer away from the time period. Gibson, similar to some of the other great directors such as Kubrick, Scorsese, Stone and he like, excels at  creating ""scene."" You really feel like 'you are there.'*******The Blu-Ray:The picture is quite beautiful. Black levels are solid, detail is quite good (though perhaps not the absolute best, I would say ""Dark Knight"" and ""Alexander"" top it), and color is very naturalistic. There is a bit of ""posterization"" in some shots of the sky (i.e. a sort of digital distortion or dot-crawl), but it only intrudes on 10 or 20 seconds of the film, and is probably in the source material. The DTS audio mix offers some nice directional effects, with crowd taunts and bird chirps in the rear sound field.Technically, it's about as good as I can imagine it looking. I did not see the film in the theater, so I cannot compare the level of fidelity.Extras include commentaries, and a ""recut"" version, which apparently is actually a bit shorter than the theatrical release. This version also cuts a bit of violence. A word to parents - cutting five minutes of gruesome violence leaves about, oh, 120 minutes of gruesome violence remaining in the movie. So plan accordingly insofar as your children can tolerate these kinds of things. Other extras: There are several commentaries on the main disc. The extra disc has many short documentaries on both production issues and historical context, though none are in HD, unfortunately.*********So should you buy it? Well, that's a tough question. If you're a devoted Christian who enjoys pondering these mysteries, and you also have a good HD setup, then sure, I can't see any reason not to. If you are not a Christian but are curious about what the hub-bub is about, then this is definitely worth at least a rental. Fans of historical fiction/docudrama will certainly find much to appreciate.Whether or not you buy it, this is definitely a film everyone should see at least once. It is a great film, like it or lump it. It is a vivid and very impactful telling of one of the very few central stories of our global culture. Keep in mind I do not want to put a Christian gloss on humanity here - if there were comparable films on Mohammad (a bit of an issue given the icon prohibition), Buddha, etc., I would recommend seeing those as well.On the whole, by any standards, this is a five-star release. It may not be for everyone's permanent collection. But those who add this Blu-Ray title to their shelf will not be disappointed."	5.0	Thoroughly impressive film and Blu-Ray presentation	2009-03-07	8	5	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3LY3RZHZGTJDC	"Matt O. ""Daffyphack"""	"When big movers and shakers of film go into my cineplex, you can bet that I'm gonna be there at some point.  So its no surprise that on the second weekend of its release (trying to avoid the Youth groups), I went to catch Mad Max's new opus, The Passion of the Christ.  For those of you who don't know about the controversy, first of all I'd like to congratulate you on coming out of your coma.  Secondly, the film has come under heavy fire from groups like the ADL for an unforgiving portrayal of the Jews as the killers of Christ.  This, in my mind, is bs.  Granted, if your audience members are complete idiots and somehow miss the recurring philosophy in the film, they might forget about that crazy ""love your neighbor"" thing, and there could be problems.  But I don't foresee these kind of troubles.And the controversy is misplaced anyway.  Yes, the Jews call for his death, throw rocks at him, punch him occasionally...but its the Romans who do the bloody stuff.  Just because they don't turn Pilate into a Bond villain doesn't mean the Romans are being portrayed sympathetically.  They do laugh a lot while they're scourging Jesus.  Which brings me to the real attention-grabber in the film.  The violence.  Lots and lots of blood.  Its not unnecessary, like in Kill Bill, but please realize that despite the fact that this movie is about Jesus, IT IS NOT FOR KIDS.  Don't take children to this, unless the children you're taking happen to be fans of Reservoir Dogs.  The whipping scene alone (which has a money shot where the cat-of-nine-tails sticks in Jesus's side and is forcefully ripped out, along with chunks of flesh) is worth the R rating, possibly NC-17.  Needless to say there were a lot of uncomfortable people in the theater with me.As for the story, there's not much to say that you probably don't already know.  It follows the Passion as told by the book of John, and the cool twist is that the entire movie is subtitled, and the actors only speak Aramaic and Latin.  Its like watching a foreign film, which would certainly turn off younger viewers.  Also, James Caviezel does a good Jesus.  Its good to finally see a Jewish Jesus for once.  One of the standout performances in my mind was that of Rosalinda Celentano, who shaved off her eyebrows to play an androgynous, but extremely creepy Satan (best this side of Al Pacino).  I've already read complaints from religious purists who moan about Satan being clearly male, but given how well she does eerie (love the baby thing), I don't think there's anything to complain about.And I'm sure that people hate to complain about a movie like this, but I have a few minor issues.  One: Near the beginning of the movie, there's a lighthearted throwaway scene in which it is implied that Jesus invented the dining room table.  I hope that it is not a central tenet of Christianity to believe this.  Two: The very ending.  And yes, I totally see how it needed to end with that last scene, but did we really need the Terminator music?  I was half expecting the line ""Pray to me if you want to live.""  All in all, a really good movie.  Heavy stuff, too.  I don't know how well it makes for repeat viewings, but it will definitely be one of those movies that will sustain classic status through our lifetimes."	4.0	powerful and moving	2004-03-31	2	0	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2VQ1ICTP9XLB0	Matt Wagenmaker	"The complaints I've heard are that the movie didn't have any background ... here goes:In the beginning God created the heaven and earth.God created mankind with free will ... He preferred that people chose to serve/worship Him instead of having a creation of ""yes men.""Satan (a fallen angel - who thought himself to be equal with God) tempted Eve and she and Adam disobeyed God (sinned).They were thrown out of the garden of Eden and everyone born since has come into the world a sinner.God's law says blood must be shed to pay the price of sin.  Before Christ (B.C.) that was done with the sacrifice of an animal (typically a lamb).Jesus (God's Son) came to be the sacrifice for all mankind and pay for everyone's sin.He chose to die Himself instead of seeing all mankind pay their own price for sin (death ... and eternity in hell).All we have to do is believe the above and we'll go to heaven for eternity with the Saviour.  Getting to heaven can't be earned by anything we do - other than believe that it's not up to our efforts ... the bill's already been paid - just accept / believe it.Everyone else, having used their God given free will, will go to hell for eternity.For more background, pick up a Bible and read it ... it's been around for 2,000 years.

If you have a dry eye after watching this - you need to re-evaluate your relationship with Christ.For the unbeliever - THIS is how much God loves you - that he gave his only Son to pay such a horrible price that you could not possibly pay yourself - for your sin.Watch this movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3SA85UX8OHR32	"M. BRAGER ""mbrager"""	Released amidst charges that it is anti-Semitic by those who have not seen it, those that do see the Passion of the Christ will discover the credibility of that charge is dismissed very quickly.Within the Pharisees, the Jewish religious leaders, contentions against the Christ are disputed by some.  What develops is the power of one individual, Caiaphas, who spearheads the effort and who gains docile to outright support from some others within a differentiated group.  In fact, Mel Gibson's production continues to compelling use various elements of differentiation.  Jews who call for crucifixion are the mob and faceless.  They are those that mindlessly follow lies when stirred to do so.  But juxtaposed against this presentation are more striking and personalized individual Jews.There is Simon of Cyrene who first reluctantly aids the Christ in carrying his cross.  He shouts to make clear that he is not associated with this man, an echo of Peter's denials.  But he is touched by the inherent charisma of Jesus through the meeting of their eyes that no crown of thorns or trickles of blood, presumably inflicted according to justice, can negate.  Another, Veronica, wipes the Christ's face while a chaotic commotion preoccupies others.  Before this moment, we are primed that it is her faith in the Christ that leads her to him despite his sufferings.  The counterweight of sobbing women along the Christ's path taken with the cross exhibit that even at group level Gibson remains true to Gospel and traditional accounts, making those planted seeds of the anti-Semitism detractors reach to put there more ridiculous.Gibson's use of the presence of Satan is striking and a unique and unexpected accomplishment of this film, too.  Gibson places Satan first in the Agony in the Garden scene, seeking to discourage the Christ from the sacrificial path.  When the Christ submits to the Father, that's when Satan's tempting presence is both figuratively and literally squashed in the form of a snake.Satan continues to appear, not as the overriding plotter or a demon casting with certainty the course of events.  No `the devil made me do it' excuse can be derived.  Rather Satan exults in victories over individuals such as Caiaphas (driven by authority), Judas, Pontius Pilate (who submits to politics) and the Christ's Roman torturers, observing with approval, as the individuals remain responsible for their individual freely made choices.  Satan attends the demon children that haunt Judas who suffers with the guilt of his acts.  Caiaphas' greatest moment of conscience occurs when the Christ upon the cross forgives him and all responsible for his crucifixion.  Caiaphas halts one stride upon hearing it, gaining irrefutable proof that the Christ endures unaltered, strength you and I can only wish to attain but fail in.  It is the example clearly given and to be practiced by followers in dealing with enemies.When Mary the mother of Jesus and Satan walk opposite sides of the cross-carrying Christ, it evokes the Catholic symbol of Mary crushing the snake beneath her foot although that ultimate battle is not fought directly at this time.  However, the spirit of Mary prevails even as she accepts the dead Christ taken down from the cross.  She is a constant for the Christ.The bloodiness of the tortured Christ throughout the movie becomes almost superfluous, as the viewer journeys into the deeper meanings overtly evident.  The journey we are taken upon is impressed upon us by the sacrifice of the man.  These are enhanced by intervals of flashbacks expertly used and that define the essence of the Christ in humanity and purpose.  Jesus is a child, a carpenter and a teacher.  At the Last Supper, the significance of the Eucharist is realized corresponding to his own played out sacrifice, making it far more than the shared meal it would have appeared if comprised in one presentation at the outset of the movie.The Resurrection of the Christ is acknowledged as the stone is heard rolling back and he stands risen.  It fulfills that gospel message of understatement rather than fanfare and miraculous.  Nor is it meant to upstage the central portion of this film.If you look for the detailed message of the Christ in one place, this is not it.  It need not be because that has been done aplenty before.  But the Passion that covers the last twelve hours of the Christ's life brilliantly transmits the essence of the sacrifice made and why, and, after all, that was Mel Gibson's purpose.  For that reason, that message, it reaches beyond any limitations that would make it just for believers.	5.0	It is as it was	2004-06-15	9	4	5

Let's not forget that there is still an Inquisition lurking in the vatican halls (under another name, of course)Let's not forget that millions of people who have been tortured through the ages since Christianity decided to forget the principles that alledgedly was built around.It is time christianity were placed before the mirror of its own cruelties and it is urgent, in the case of this movie, to remember that Christianity has not earned the right to be throwing stones around.

I am so glad it is doing so well at the box office, I knew it would. I went the opening day and I have never been in a theater that quiet. There was not a single sound from the audience during the whole film and nobody left until after the credits. During one of the scenes after Jesus was taken down from the cross and Mary was holding Him the screne went blank for a few seconds and there was no sound even from the audience, it was soo quiet you could hear a pin drop. I am a Baptist, and from reading about His crusifixion in the Bible you really can't imagine what He went through (the scourging and everything) until you actually see this film. My eyes were filled with tears and there were other times when I was even gasping for breath. Jim Caviezel done a very, very good job. I remember watching the ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" when it came out and looking at Jim Caviezel I was thinking, ""he would make a good Jesus in a film"" and when I watched it again with my mom she said the same thing. Sure enough ""The Passion"" came and he plays Jesus. I really, really hope it keeps the number one spot at the box office for a long time and hope it gets nominated for the awards next year, it deserves an Oscar!God Bless All"	5.0	GOD BLESS MEL!	2004-03-04	7	2	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AESY8NCX6VS6O	M. Burns	If you've been living under a rock for the past, oh, year or so, I might as well inform you that the most controversial movie in years has been released into theaters. And this isn't Bernardo Bertolucci controversy; this isn't even D.W. Griffith controversy; this is first-rate, full-blown religious controversy, and it's done nothing but cling to every mention of director Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Turn on the television and they're talking about it, get in any gathering of people and it comes up, open any entertainment magazine and it's front-page news. But now it's February 25, Ash Wednesday nearly two-thousand years after the event depicted in the film occurred, and the movie has hit screens. I had the opportunity to see the film earlier this evening and see how all the criticism and controversy I've heard and read stands up. Well, as you'll read, that unjust criticism of anti-semitism, too-graphic violence, and spiritual insignificance tumbles like a man beneath a cross, and Gibson's ferocious, passionate film triumphs like the Savior from a tomb. In this review, I'll try not to give away why Gibson's film is set apart from other run-of-the-mill Biblical films; you can see it for yourself. But I do want to convey why The Passion ranks as one of the most important cinematic experiences I have ever had.Like any great epic, the first thing that stands out is how visually striking the movie is, and The Passion of the Christ is no exception. The camera trails gently through the garden, and we see Jesus. Except, this is not the mechanical, puppeteer Jesus of so many other passion plays this is a man who knows what lies before him. A man who knows the kind of responsibility he has. A man who, despite being scared out of his mind, knows that he can take the challenge. Jesus, played with grace and utter devotion by Jim Caviezel, is the human that many other narratives seem to leave out. I found myself amazed at Gibson's choice to show not doubt, but simply fear - something that would come to any man who had to endure what Jesus does in the next two hours of the film.The scenes in which Jesus is brought before the high priest Caiaphus have brought accusations of anti-semitism to the film, but anti-semitism was the last thing that came to my mind as various people stood before Him and ranted that He was nothing more than a crazy blasphemer that encouraged the drinking of His blood and the disobedience of Jewish customs. Well, to the leaders of the Jewish faith, that's what Jesus was - He was a man who went against their establishment and they found nothing more suitable than to have his life taken for it. In placid flashbacks that gorgeously contrast with the escalating violence of the proceedings, we see Jesus encouraging his disciples to love one another and even hate those that persecute them. That went against the teachings of the Pharisees, but it certainly has made the world a better place today. Gibson's film separates Jew-hating from people-loving, the notion that the film truly embraces.Not much time is wasted before the film launches into some of the most stomach-churning, brutal violence ever committed to mainstream cinema. In a brutal scourging sequence, we see pieces of Jesus' skin flayed off as multiple Roman soldiers pound him to within an inch of his life. The long, arduous trek to Golgotha features lashes with whips among other forms of physical torture. Before seeing the film, I was worried that accusations that the violence detracts from the film's spiritual meaning would ring true. It doesn't - the suffering of Christ depicted in the film produces not a feeling of pointless blood-spattering, but divine sacrifice. Jesus is shown as a man who was sent to spread a message of love and redemption, and Gibson's movie rightfully asserts that in order for it to all come to fruition, He had to endure this. But that is not to say that this movie is meant for any person, young or old. The violence is tolerable, but at times - barely.Any doubts about Gibson's intentions on making this film are dispelled in the climactic scene of the film in which Jesus has his hands and feet nailed to the cross on which he eventually dies. This disturbing-but-earthshakingly-powerful scene ranks among the most powerful I have ever witnessed in the cinema. The brutal nailing to the cross and presentation before the crowd represents the pinnacle of Christianity, the moment at which the weight of the world falls on one man's shoulders. And you feel it. At the movie's normal moments, it is accurate and engrossing. At moments like this, it's so powerful it's hard to look.I, too, probably like every other critic on the face of the earth, walked into the movie expecting to find gaping flaws, excessive use of an artistic license, and too-graphic violence, but getting up from my seat at the end of the immensely moving film, I could only think of...well, how much crap all of those critics are full of. Forget about what you've read - the violence is not repugnant, it serves a purpose; the film is not anti-semitic, it is accurate; the movie is not a publicity stunt, but a deeply-felt expression of one man's passion about one man's sacrifice. From the opening moments of The Passion, Gibson's film is a visually gorgeous, deeply emotional, and accurate rendering of the single most important event in the history of man. The film's brutal, violently moving climax elevates it to a standard of excellence that Gibson has never before achieved, and not only do I approve immensely of it, but I think that it is a landmark in religious art and a movie not soon to be forgotten. I'm trying to not use the word 'masterpiece' so much anymore, but I'm pulling it out of retirement for this movie. GRADE: A	5.0	A masterpiece of religious art - simply unforgettable	2004-02-26	1	1	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3SDW7WS3YCCI7	M. Castillo	"Everybody agrees that this is a great movie. Some guys are questioning the fact that this movie is too bloody. But is quite real. Read the gospels. Our Saviour didn't come here for pleasure, or for chatting with Herod, drink some wine, have wonderful feasts and marry a beautiful girl (some fools say he married Mary Magdalane)and be eternally happy  as Hollywood wants us to believe. No. He came here to redeem us. He came here to show us how a Christian should face suffering And above this, he came here to show us the real face of the Father, Our Father that is LOVE. Seeing this movie is seeing how much Jesus loves us.Meditating The Passion of the Christ is the DEVOTION of Devotions. A lot of conversions have occurred after people meditating these sufferings of Our Lord. ALL the Saints have meditated and had a profound devotion for them. Even more, they recommended this devotion in order to obtain real sanctity of life, because the REAL LOVE (only somebody that is willing to suffer like this and die for you , really loves you!) attracts LOVERS.Regarding the accusations of ""antisemitism"", I just have one recommendation. GET REAL. JEWS have always hated Jesus and his Church. They killed him and they persecuted and killed Jesus' followers. Deep inside they feel Guilty of these crimes and they think that denying the facts, buying some people's conciense is going to make them feel better. But that's not the case. I recommend them to ask forgiveness. First, to God and then to the whole world for al their crimes, lies and corruption they have sown in the world. Then they are going to feel free at last...Nobody is going to do anything or throw a sotone at them. We all are sinners! They also should try considering returning Palestine (they stole it to the palestinians with the help of UN that was and still is under their control) to their legal owners and leave in peace.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A17LSEN4UY4XZQ	M. Daneker	"Not being religious I have no bias toward watching a Christ figure get caned, torn up and crucified, however watching Scorsese brilliant, if too long, The Last Temptation of Christ (the temptation being Lucifer offering Christ a mans life if he gives up his role as the savior, guess which choice Jesus makes?)I was able to become involved with the character and what drove him. In Gibson's telling of the last 12 hours (with a few flashbacks to fill in plot holes)I get nothing but a feeling that Christ should have just stayed down when he had the chance.Let me make some points here:First: The story starts with Judas selling out Christ, it should have started with Christ coming to the Temple and saying he would tear it down and rebuild it in three days. This is the thing that inflamed the Jews to want him dead so bad, he threatened their power. Leaving this out of the film only leaves the viewer trying to grasp why they hated him.Second: No emotional involvement. Gibson tries to let the torture speak for itself. There's nothing more than fleeting flashbacks with Jesus (pronounced hea'shu) and either Mary his mother or his love, nothing to emotionally attach them to him, or us. Watching his mother weep over him when he gets back up after a brutal beating is called to an end, inflaming the Romans to inflict more damage, feels hollow. We haven't established anything beyond ""this is mom."" He could have pointed the camera at any weeping extra in the crowd and put a subtitle ""my son!"" under her with equal impact. You have to ask, what the hell did he get up for? To be hurt more! Why? So he'd be a martyr. You know, I want Kerry elected president, should I invite Republicans to beat me to death to prove how horrible I think they are? There is a scene in The Village where a character is stabbed, there's nearly no blood, zero gore, yet the emotional impact is heavy, you fear for his life, you feel for his girl and you hate his killer. There's a castration scene in I Spit On Your Grave that shows nothing because it all takes place under a bubble bath, yet you know it's happening and you squirm and you want to look away. Then there's the F*** me Jesus scene in the Exorcist when you desperately want the suffering of the little girl to stop. In this film I just wanted Jesus to Stop Getting Up!Third: Gibson's Christ is not a persecuted Jew trying to lead people to the love of God, his father, he's a self righteous [dumber] who says ""father my heart is ready"" before torture ""Father, why have you forsaken me"" when he's nailed to a cross and ""I'm ready"" when he's had enough. Now why does he tell God he's ready to be flayed, then complain when it happens. Christ offers himself up for torture, then looks on as if to say, ""see what I do for you?"" Well, how asked him?Forth: No conclusion. Not only does Gibson not bother to show us why they Jews hate him (oddly, only Pilot's motivations are clearly shown, in the end he's the one you feel bad for, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, but doesn't what his head off either.) but doesn't show that any good comes out of it.Fifth: The Devil. What's with the Nelly - Demon - Reaper??? Some androgynous freak torments Christ, yeah, see the root of homophobia is that Gibson portrays Tran gendered people as Lucifer.Sixth: Now Ascension? What the hell, he rises and fade to black? What's this? Where's the lords message? Nowhere in this film. This film is a knock-off of Barker's Hellraiser. 127 minutes of torture with no beginning and no conclusion. A three hour film would have let us see Christ live and love before the crucifixion, and let us see the impact of resurrection. However Gibson just wanted an exploitation of pain thinly veiled as religious rhetoric.Last: If you believe in Christ, share what he stood for, not how he died! Peace, Love, Good Will. Not self righteous martyrs! Not Pain! Not Violence! Not hate and ignorance! This is a film only for those who know the entire story by heart because this is just one long scene way out of context.Finally: See the Last Temptation of Christ and Dogma, two misunderstood films made by people who love there lord and savior and want people to walk out with the positive not negative. Enough with the hell and damnation, let Clive Barker do that, he's better at it."	1.0	The Flaying of the Christ; Incomplete, and uninspired.	2004-09-03	65	32	33

It's what happened to Jesus Christ because of our sins. He took on all that suffering for us and the film is true to the torture Jesus endured because of His passion, yet it astounds me to read the reviews that give this film one star precisely because of the violence in it. It is also appalling to read the misinformed non-believers disgrace His memory by daring to type the word ""myth"" with anything regarding Jesus. Jesus was not only an actual person who walked the earth and left His footprints, He is a historical figure, and the Redeemer of all humanity. So sad that there are still so many ungrateful people.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"This movie has had so much hype surrounding it, even before it was released, and with the press ripping into it before it even came out, that Mel Gibson must have been losing some sleep over this. Fortunately, after ploughing a hefty chunk of his own money to finance it, he's gained it back - and then some! The Passion has made a tremendous amount in the US, and looks to go along the same lines in the UK. And there are rumours of a novelisation and a sequel. :)Everyone has to know the story of Jesus, whether you're a religious churchgoer, and read the bible, or whether you shun all that kind of thing. I won't transport you back to your Sunday School days here, you can read other reviews for that. Jim Caviezel plays the lead character, and was chosen because of his initials, he is the same age as Jesus when he died (33), and he is a devout Christian. Mel Gibson could have gone for a high profile name to boost the film a bit (Jason Patric and Johnathon Schaech were both apparently approached), but instead, he chose a relatively unknown actor, and shows you don't need an A-list actor to make a film a success. There are a lot of shots of Jim's eye (throughout most of the movie, one eye is completely swollen), which were digitally changed to brown, but his eyes are absolutely gorgeous!If you've seen this movie, you already know it's extremely violent. If you haven't, then you've probably read reviews, or heard through word of mouth, that it's one of the most gorily realistic movies out there right now, or ever. This movie is deeply disturbing, and brutally and vividly depicts the inhumanity of man to fellow man. Watching this, I felt physically sick at one point (the cat o'nine tails whip thing), and even halfway through, I wasn't sure how much more I could have taken. But although it's extremely gory, you can't drag your eyes away from the screen, you just feel you have to keep watching. It must have been hell for Jim to be a part of this movie, and there were probably points throughout the movie that he wouldn't have been sure how much more he could have done. He has spoken about a few of the difficulties he experienced while filming. These included being accidentally whipped twice, which has left a 14 inch scar on his back; being struck by lightning while filming the Sermon on the Mount and during the crucifixion, experienced hypothermia during the dead of winter in Italy.The film's dialogue is all in Aramaic, with some Hebrew and Latin. It is subtitled, and although some people may not want to see a movie where they have to read, the subtitles are in no way intrusive, and it's really easy to read them and follow the film at the same time. Some of the dialogue isn't subtitled (mainly spoken by the soldiers I noticed), but it doesn't really matter and most of the time, it's obvious what they're saying, just by watching the action. Some of the dialogue is pretty similar to dialogue today - ""yes"" is ""aye"", which if you're Scottish, you'll use quite a lot, and ""idiot"" is still the same word, just ""idiota""!In certain scenes you see a very androgynous person in the crowds, or right at the start when Jesus is praying. Just in case anyone was curious, this is a female, and she's supposed to be Satan. It's never explained that she is the Devil, but apparently, she's supposed to be.There aren't many well-known actors in this; the only recognisable name is Monica Bellucci, who stays pretty much covered up for once! (Sorry to disappoint all the male fans of her in Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions.) She plays Mary Magdalene, although it's not exactly obvious who she's actually supposed to be at first, she just seems to hang around with another Mary - Jesus' mother. She doesn't have much dialogue to say, but she looks amazing, even without the makeup piled on with a trowel. Some actresses can get away with not wearing so much makeup and they're dead lucky. Maia Morgenstern, who played Mary, mother of Jesus, is only six years than James Cavaziel, and certainly doesn't look old enough to play his mother!)There are going to be some people who will not like this film, whether it's because of all the hype, whether they're extremely fainthearted and won't be able to handle the violence - which I'd just like to say, I'm one of those people! But this movie you have to see to actually believe. No review will do this movie justice, whether it's a good or bad review. If you don't see it, you're not lining Mel Gibson's pockets (that could be a good or a bad thing), but on the other hand you're not seeing a piece of history.I think all the fuss about anti-Semitism is overblown. Although it was the Jewish priests calling for the crucifixion, it was the Roman soldiers dishing out all the brutal punishment. Also, it was never clear quite why there was such bad feeling towards Jesus.I now eagerly await the DVD (and the novelisation, and the sequel), and if Mel-baby doesn't take a chance and put hours of extras onto the DVD, I'll be severely disappointed. If all I get is a trailer, I'll put my foot down, and boycott it! He's a smart guy, I'm sure there will be loads of extras. Personally, I can't wait.A little bit of trivia to end this review - apparently, it's Mel's hands that nail Jim to the cross."	4.0	Great movie, but will make you feel physically sick	2004-05-14	15	12	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"""The Passion of the Christ"" tells the familiar story of Jesus (Jim Caviezel) being captured by the Roman guard as he prays with his disciples in the garden at Gethsemane. Christ is then turned over to Pontius Pilate before ultimately being handed over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.Mel Gibson's screenplay does a good job of sticking to the original story of the crucifixion as laid out by the Gospels.  He also deserves commendation for refusing to shy away from the torture of Christ that most other filmmakers have stayed away from when tackling this subject.  However, the elements of blood and gore steal the focus from the core message that the film attempts to deliver.The violence of the film is what most people come away talking about after seeing it, which is understandable since the film is almost entirely about violence.  The majority of the film focuses on the gruesome torture of Jesus, but it would not be fair to classify ""The Passion"" as the most violent film ever made.  War movies such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and even Gibson's Oscar winning epic ""Braveheart"" are just two of the many films that strike me as being much more violent than this film.However, if you do not possess a Christian understanding of the true ""passion"" of the Christ that Gibson is trying to depict, then you will likely come away from the theatre focused on nothing but the carnage.""The Passion"" is a story of unconditional love and sacrifice.  It purposely focuses on Jesus' torture and death in order to reflect Gibson's personal beliefs that Christ was indeed the Messiah who gave up his own life in order to offer the rest of humankind eternal salvation.  And unless you are aware of that message, this film will be nothing to you except a story about a man who is severely beaten and then executed.Many critics of the film have claimed that it promotes anti-Semitism, and this debate has been responsible for much of the attention that ""The Passion"" sparked even months before its opening.  However, Gibson has not in any way set out to promote anti-Semitism, and his film does no such thing.  The movie accurately depicts the villains of the story, who are made up of a group of Jewish politicians, some sadistic Roman soldiers, and a selfish governor who willingly condemns an innocent man to death in order to serve his own political interests.There are many excellent performances in this film, notably Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern as Mary and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene.  However, Hristo Shopov steals the show as Pontius Pilate, who is forced to choose between his own beliefs and the pressures of his people in order to determine the fate of an innocent man.Rosalinda Celentano's character is one of the major liberties that Gibson takes with the script.  She does a convincing job of playing Satan, but she appears at very random parts of the film and seems to detract from the rest of the scene instead of adding anything to it.  (The fact that Gibson decided that Satan should look like Peter Jackson's depiction of Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is also a bit distracting.)Anyone who has a slight knowledge of Christian tradition will be moved by ""The Passion.""  Those who do are not familiar with the story of the Gospels will be unable to grasp Gibson's message, and this film will be wasted on them.  Gibson has done an amazing job of transcending the story of Christ's ultimate sacrifice to the screen.  ""The Passion"" is the most accurate depiction of that story that has ever been made, and it should be admired for that, although it will ultimately have different impacts for people of different backgrounds.NOTE:  This film has an R rating, which I deem as appropriate.  There are many people clamoring about how ""The Passion"" should have been given a rating of NC-17 and that children have no business seeing this film.  Although I think that parents should take their child's individual needs into consideration before allowing them to see any movie, I witnessed many young children in attendance with their parents at the theatre, and they appeared to handle the movie without a problem.  Children who have been raised in a Christian environment will be familiar with the story of Christ's execution already, and parents may feel that the film is an excellent way to reinforce the story of Jesus' sacrifice."	5.0	Brilliant, but misunderstood by most.	2004-05-30	9	7	2

The Passion of The Christ made the crucifiction of Christ and what He did for all of us seem more real. I felt like I was there 2000 years ago when it happened and it really brought home how much Jesus suffered for my sins. Jesus went kicking and screaming? I don't think so! Jesus did not want this because He knew He was going to suffer, but He also knew that this needed to be done to save all of us in the world who cannot control themselves enough to get through one hour without sinning. There was no other way. No one could have made Christ do this. He had legions of angels at His disposal; He truely laid down his life because He knew it was the only way to reconsile us to the Father. He is my Savior and I cannot stand for anyone to belittle what He did. He died for you. It is up to you whether or not you choose to accept that.	5.0	The most important movie you will ever see.	2005-01-05	8	0	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3C9KX3AD7EAJE	MerryPrankster	"I might as well start by saying that the use of dead languages in the movie was amazing. That is the only reason I rate this movie 2 stars instead of 1.Now, where to begin? Why did Gibson make this movie? Well, Christianity is the largest religion that is currently in existence. If you create a movie that has 40% of Christianity buzzing, the other 60% will take notice. Would you believe that Sunday school children were actually taken to see this drivel? I can, know why? Gibson created one of those movies that make a whole group of people feel they have to see it. You ever see how many star wars fans lined up to see episode 2? That's because they felt they had to see it, no matter how bad it is.Another thing that people blow out of proportion is how Gibson used his own money to make this movie. So what! He makes a couple million each movie he makes! And don't you think he kinda knew that it would be a box office smash? I mean a movie about Jesus created by Mel Gibson?! Cha-ching! If Gibson had donated the money to the Christian Children's Fund, then that'd be something.Did you know that the Bible says very little about Jesus' death? It doesn't go in-depth like this trash does. What you basically are presented here is a snuff movie that shocks the moviegoer into paying attention.The basic idea behind this movie is that Jesus died for our sins; a theme that Gibson pounds into us as much as possible. He tries to display, as graphically as possible, the passion of Christ. This leaves many Christians open to saying things like ""how can you still be a (non-Christian religion) when you just saw how much Christ suffered for you?"" The ultimate guilt trip.A person shouldn't be forced to believe in something just because of how horrendously the ""prophet"" died. They should follow it because of what they taught. The fact that people went in droves to watch this filth is a real disservice to Jesus. Jesus taught love, forgiveness, and compassion. Why do you need a 3-hour movie to remind you of his teachings? Why do you need to be shocked into following his examples?Let me also remind the reader that the passion has existed since the Middle Ages. Do we really want to go back to a time of fire and brimstone and all that jazz? Why drag an old, tired play into the 21st century?And finally, I would like to close by saying this: I am not a Christian. I'm sure I made that abundantly clear. I was raised catholic but have since converted. I am a spiritual man and I am very open-minded. I believe in love and kindness and forgiveness. What hypocrites some of these reviewers are when they create reviews with titles like ""A TRUE MASTERPIECE !! SHOWS HOW STUPID NON BELIEVERS ARE"" That review was created by a person called ""S.D.S"" Look at his other reviews, he calls Dale Earnhardt some pretty horrible things. If you were a true believer then you would not judge him, since you are not God. And even if you were God, YOU'D FORGIVE HIM!As long as you live a good life, as long as you love your neighbor, as long as you forgive he that hurts you, you are living for the Lord. And you don't have to watch this movie to prove how much of a believer you are. So instead of wasting time to watch this horrible movie, why don't you volunteer at a homeless shelter, or donate the money you would have spent on this movie to a charitable organization?"	2.0	Donate your money, don't waste it on this!	2005-12-04	31	9	22
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3S4RV6472W59P	M. Gage	"Ok, so supposedly the Anti-Defamation League has its panties in a bunch because of this film. True, the Pharisees were portrayed as being pretty ruthless in their insistence that Jesus be crucified. And their cruelty seemed to stem from superstition and fear; which is not particularly flattering. Jesus' buddy Peter, also Jewish, turned his back on him when he needed him most. Jesus' Jewish mom and other male friend (some apostle) just stood around and shook their heads as he was tortured for an inordinate amount of screen time. And we all know about Judas. So yeah, the Jews (except Jesus) in the film aren't portrayed in the kindest of lights.But it's not Fiddler on the Roof. It's a story of a man (divine or otherwise) put to an excruciating and drawn out death because of intolerance and fear. Seems like something the ADL could relate to. But from their reaction one would think that no Jew is allowed to be portrayed as anybody but a lovable comic or respectable holocaust survivor.Besides, the Romans in this movie were far FAR worse. The degree of sadism by which the soldiers carry out their orders is stomach turning beyond anything that could be deemed ""unfavorable."" It's the Italians who should be up in arms.All this, I suppose, is beside the point of a review. The movie is inspiring. It is very emotional. It is excessively violent. And it is drawn out. The story is essentially the slow agonizing demise of Jesus.  One would have to be a bit of a sadist to purchase the DVD for multiple viewings. The film dwells more on the gore than the triumphs or teachings of Jesus. I'm sure Mel ""Mad Max"" Gibson thought that by making it really graphic and disgusting he could play up the sacrifice that JC made for all of us sinners. But after a while it falls flat and Jesus becomes somewhat of a punching bag.Also, should Jesus and Mary have been white?  One would have to believe they'd be a least little tan. I mean, if the tearing of the flesh is going to be ultra-realistic, shouldn't the flesh itself be as well?Christian or not, it's an interesting take on a story that has had an monumental effect on the world today. But I believe the film's message becomes obscured by the violence used to convey it. I don't say this because I can't watch violence. I'm a huge ""Road Warrior"" fan.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1Y6KW8HYJWFZC	"M. Gonya ""rawker"""	"This is probably a very unpopular opinion but I believe ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" had more ""Passion"" in it than this film. Yes, this movie was very realistic in the portrayal of the time in which Jesus would have lived and it follows certain scriptures very closely but it didn't compel me to become more religious. ""Last Temptation.."" made me want to read the Bible more and research religion further. ""Last Temptation..."" didn't follow the scripture all that closely but showed what Jesus as a man would have had to gone through...even though this in to itself is pretty blasphamous. ""The Passion"" is basically an extremely violent and bloody retelling of the last hours of Christ, which is how it should be shown... although is it something that really needs to be shown? For aetheists or agnosticts I don't believe this movie is going to make them believe anymore than they would have before. For Christian's it could either be uplifting or an extremely depressing couple of hours. I saw a showing with a friend's church group and at the end I saw an elderly lady with her head down just sobbing...there is nothing really happy or redeeming in this movie. The biggest fault of the movie is not going more deeply into the reserrected Jesus story, the movie would have been a tad less depressing if it went into that story more instead of having the audience sit through about 2 hours of ultraviolence.If anyone has seen any of Mel Gibson's films they would know that Mel Gibson is no stranger to violence. In this movie it is no different. It would have been nice to to see Mel try something other than violence to run the story along. It can be said that a person may feel more appreciation toward Christ after viewing this movie but personally I felt the violence bogged the movie down. It seems that Mel Gibson uses violence as a way of getting his movies noticed, with a movie of this subject I don't believe he needed it...not that I oppose of violence in films. I don't believe this is the best movie about Jesus, I would have to say ""Last Temptation of Christ"" is more psychological and therefore a better movie. Scorsese was more imaginative with his movie and didn't depend on violence in making his point. Both are very personal movies for the directors but ""The Passion"" is just not as spiritually redeeming as ""Last Temptation of Christ"". I would recommend ""Last Temptation of Christ"" over ""The Passion of the Christ"" to anyone who wants to be spiritually inspired."	3.0	"One Opinion...

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"The story of Christ and his last days on earth has been the subject of movies for as long as there have been movies. And most of these films, except for Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" have been exceedingly reverent and unfortunately hokey: films that were made mostly to tap into a ready-made audience of the devout and purposely not meant to cause a stir and therefore ignoring what it was that made Jesus the revolutionary man that he was. A Man that was as conflicted about we humans as we are about ourselves.One of the best things about Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is that it shows Christ not only as a Spiritual man but as a man whose time on earth was spent as, not only a leader, but as a dedicated son, an expert craftsman and a kind and loving friend to his disciples. He was the ultimate human being after all and Gibson captures this side of Christ amazingly well.""The Passion of the Christ"" also raises as many questions as it attempts to answer and this is on the plus side. But several things about it are too tame: the music for one is dreadful:  all soaring voices, and Middle Eastern doodling cheapens the effect of the visuals. The music should have been spare and lean, used mainly to quietly underscore the inherent drama of the story. Another minus is the use of Aramaic and Latin instead of English or some other modern language. Authentic or not, all this does is telescope the story away from us rather than bringing it as close to us as possible.The incessant brutalizing of Christ is graphic to say the least and even though I had to turn away from the screen on several occasions; I felt that the violence was ultimately cathartic and dramatically truthful. Remember this a film, after all: a drama based on the Bible and interpreted by Gibson and his screenwriter. The purpose of this film is to dramatize, i.e. tell its story in an effective, truthful and honest a manner as possible.The issues with Gibson using this story to primarily implicate the Jews as the primary assassins of Christ are ludicrous: they had a part because they felt Jesus was a threat but equally to blame was Pilate and most of the Romans and almost everyone else including Judas, Peter and Jesus himself. The only people that seemingly escape Gibson's blame are Mary and Mary Magdalene. In fact one of the most touching scenes in this film shows Mary placing her ear to a stone road to listen for her son's heartbeat as he hangs handcuffed to a pole below.""The Passion of the Christ"" is not perfect, but it is honest and caring and comes from a place of Love. And because it so personal and emotional, so much of the Light, it will be praised and reviled for many years to come."	4.0	Forgive Us	2004-02-25	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	"Based on all the hoopla, positive and negative, I went to this movie thinking I would be bored from knowing the story and disgusted by the violence.  I was wrong!  Not only does the Aramaic work well and convincing but also the story was ""fresh"" and exciting.  Gibson does a super job of directing putting in some very scary scenes such as a snake that appears to come from a demon and having some children turn demonic and attack Judas.As Jesus is beaten by sadistic and unfeeling Romans, the populace look on including his mother.  You feel her pain as the torturers flay him to a point that you wonder if he has any skin left.  Throughout the beatings there are some very nice flashbacks, showing Jesus in happy times with his mother, making a table for her.The only drawback to the movie is the part when Jesus is made to drag his cross to the crucifixion site.  Gibson seemed to drag that part out almost 30 minutes.  It is quite interesting that a man is forced to help Jesus carry his cross and the man seems to have more difficulty than Jesus even though Jesus is a bloody mess all over his body.The movie seems to place the main blame on the Jewish priest Kyfus who seems to be obsessed with seeing Jesus die for going against Kyfus's teachings.  Kyfus spurs the Jewish crowd to demand that Jesus be crucified.Like anything Biblical, we will never know what is the truth and what is someone's interpretation.  And yes, with things like The Da Vinci Code, many people question if any of this story is true.  That is up to your own personal beliefs.  However, whether your believe or not, Gibson has made a powerful film and by far the best rendition of the story that I have seen and this movie can be enjoyed both by believer and non-believer alike!"	5.0	You Don't Need to Be a Believer to Enjoy this Film!	2004-06-19	7	4	3

Well, it's beautifully shot and flawlessly acted (except for the horrible priests and let's not forget Jesus himself, playing a slab of meat to be shredded is not acting). I personally loved the Devil in the movie.  But other than that... it was so damned blah.  Jesus was a fascinating man. His teachings were wonderful and important.  But that doesn't matter... Hell, none of that matters.  Why should it?  Watching him being beaten to death is just so much more manipulative.  Let's get everybody all whipped up into a frenzy by graphically showing them the death of their savior.  Hey that's a great idea!  Faith is never more fervent then when it comes from guilt or fear.  And let's not forget the cash... loads and loads of cash for Mel.  People, you can believe what you want, but the bottom line is cash, cash, cash and more cash.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	"In years to come, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST will be the standard for any movie about the death of Jesus.  Mel Gibson's personal vision erases any memories of Hollywood's attempts to cinematize the last days of Jesus on earth.Forget the anti-Semitic ravings; forget the claims of brutality and gore for gore sakes; forget Gibson's personal ""asides"".  This movie should be required for any Christian who believes in the Messiah and understands that his death was for us, for all generations, with no blame being placed, only the eternal message of love one another at its foundation.No movie has affected me as much as this movie.  Being a Catholic, I have tended to think of movies like ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" or 'King of Kings"" as representations of the Passion.  This movie, however, overwhelms the others by presenting the scourging and the Crucifixion in the brutal means in which they occurred.  How anyone can watch this movie and not feel the lashes of the whips, the pain of the nails and not be touched is beyond me.  Gibson has helmed a movie that I will never forget.  There are so many images that haunt me that it's hard to pinpoint any of them.  I cried, but not only at the brutality of the Roman soldiers and the hordes of people who spit, mocked and humiliated this gentle man whose only crime was his heritage.  I cried when a mother remembered her son's first fall, and how she rushes to him when he drops beneath the weight of the cross; the memories of Jesus' dining room table; the Last Supper.  It is to not only Gibson's credit, but to the actors, technicians, Caleb Deschanel's cinematography, John Denby's awesome score, that THE PASSION is a movie of epic proportions.James Caviezel doesn't say a whole lot, but his trip to Golgotha is a brave performance, and Jim is magnificent.  Equally impressive is Maia Morgenstern as Mary, the mother.  With very little dialogue, Morgenstern embodies the heart of this extraordinary woman, and her performance is Oscar worthy, as is Caviezels.  Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene is wonderful, as is Jacob Mehr who plays Simon of Cyrene.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is not an easy movie to watch; many times I wanted to turn my eyes away.  But it is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen.  Mel Gibson is to be applauded for taking a personal risk for a personal vision that can be shared by not only Christians, but all men and women.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1261FPO8QLQ88	Michael D. Pierce	"Okay, first of all, I'm not that much of a religious person.  But I know a thing or two about movies.  The movie, on its own, without judging it from a religious standpoint, is good.  That's all.  Good.  There's nothing in it we haven't seen before (except for the graphic violence) in a film about Jesus.  It's good, that's about it.  Two things about it though -  1st- The ending - If it would've just stay faded out after the crucifiction, that would have been fine.  But the ending they had WAS SO CHEESY.  Jesus is in the tomb, stands up - we see a computer generated hole in his hand, the drums on the soundtrack come up, and he walks off.  Why didn't they just have him turn, wink at the camera, and say ""I'm back!"" a la ""The Terminator""?  It was silly, unnecessary, and left a bad taste in my mouth when I left the theatre.2nd - The thing that disturbed me the most about this movie was not the bloody violence, the crucifiction of a savior, or any supposed anti-semetic stuff.  It was the satan lady who walked around and looked at Jesus.  When she was holding the baby devil and it turned around and smiled, OH MY LORD WHAT WAS THAT!!!

After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah, I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114), with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place, it just starts to get a little silly, kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is, of course, not very funny, especially when the punishment is Death By Torture, so I did my best not to laugh.If Evangelicals, Opus Dei Catholics, sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing, they are most welcome to.

Nonetheless, they are all represented by 'THE' Christ.The movies hardcore brutality against the Christ shows the reality in His death. Believe it or not, the movie doesn't show the TRUTH about the scourging from the Romans. From verse, it is said that the Christ was beaten 'beyond recognition'(NIV). In the movie, you could well see he was the man that had been spit on earlier. In real life... it was ten times worse.Everything in this movie, without a doubt, is acted extremely well.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;The Passion of the Christ,&quot; directed by Mel Gibson, dramatizes the final hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth (played by James Caviezel).  We follow him through trial, torture, and to his crucifixion under Roman imperial authority.  Yes, this story has been told before on film, but Gibson's &quot;Passion&quot; is still worth seeing.  It's a beautifully crafted film: sets, costumes, cinematography, musical score, etc. are all impressive, and superbly complement the script and performances.&quot;The Passion&quot; is noteworthy for its intense, graphic violence.  Jesus is savagely tortured, and Gibson floods the screen with blood and ripped flesh.  Is it too much?  I'm torn on that question, but rarely have I seen human cruelty and human suffering so intensely capture on film.Caviezel is solid in the role, and brings a real warmth and humanity to the flashback scenes of Jesus' life before his trial and death.  Interestingly, though, Roman governor Pontius Pilate (well played by Hristo Naumov Shopov) is better developed as a cinematic character; Pilate faces a real moral and political dilemma, and his decision drives the story forward.  At times Jesus seems less a fully-fleshed character than a mirror through which we encounter Pilate, the disciple Peter, and others.I found a weak point in the film to be the depiction of the Jewish religious hierarchy.  They are one-dimensional, and their relationship to Jesus is insufficiently fleshed out.  If Gibson had explored these characters with the same attention given to the characters of Pilate and Pilate's wife, I think the film would have been even more powerful.Still, this is a rich, well-crafted film that can be analyzed on many levels.  Colonial politics, the relations between religious and civil authority, capital punishment, mob thinking, the place of women in a male-dominated social sphere--these are some of the issues one could raise in a discussion of the film.  &quot;The Passion&quot; is, however, at its strongest when it focuses on the basic humanity of its characters--I was especially moved by the relationship between Jesus and his mother (Maia Morgenstern).  I hope that people will approach the film not merely as a divisive theological tract or culture war battle site.  Because I believe that as a pure piece of cinematic art, &quot;The Passion&quot; has something to offer to people regardless of their religious or political orientation.	4.0	A &quot;Passion&quot; full of pain and power	2004-03-11	8	3	5

But be warned, it is brutal and unforgiving in its portrayal of a most amazing human being to walk our earth.  The use of Aramaic and Latin give a depth and poignancy to the film that is not realized till after the film is over.  We have not heard a particular accent that may be British, South African, or the varied American flavors to detract from the power and depth of what is portrayed on the screen.  Gibson's direction is remarkable.  The actors take this very particular and most intense period of time beyond any previous portrayal given to the passion this Yeshua (the Aramaic name for Jesus) experienced.  The violence is not gratuitous.  What is in the writings (the gospels and other early written material) depicts a most horrific account of the torture and execution of this Yeshua.  Again be warned, it is very difficult to watch.  Know this.  As a film all on its own, separate from a &#34;religious&#34; point of view, The Passion Of The Christ achieves a level of acting, direction, camera and sound work that should be looked at and studied.	5.0	A Very Special Movie	2013-07-26	4	3	1

For all of Gibson's  much discussed devotion, he delivers a Jesus that seems remote, and detatched without a trace of kindness. The violence was hyped and not nearly as graphic as I expected, and it was presented in such an overly art-directed fashion that is was rendered meaningless (the bloody floor after the scourging scene was so elegantly styled and photographed that it held no horror or impact). Gibson's Jesus suffered so stoically that his ordeal seemed more an inconvenience than sacrifice. In fact all of the characters seemed stripped of any humanity and emotion. At least the Bowie-esque Satan and T. Rex-like Herod added some glam rock camp to the proceedings (maybe Lou Reed should have played Pilate). As a fan of Roman history and considering Mr. Gibson's  beliefs I was expecting to find the film overly pious. I wasn't expecting a film so overblown, bloated and silly (what was that werewolf that growled at Judas, and the demon baby that looked like Uncle Fester?).Shallow, self-indulgent, and murky to the point of meaningless, this film would have had a hard time making it into theatrical release without the Mel Gibson-fueled contoversies.	1.0	Jesus Christ Superstar without the singing	2004-09-09	73	37	36

Concerning o the negative media hype, we did not come out of the theater with a sense of hatred for Jews, Romans, or anyone else.  Quite the contrary - my wife was moved to tears several times, and while I did not cry, I certainly gained an even greater appreciation of what Jesus Christ did for us!Yes, the movie did contain some of the Hollywood creativity you see in movies based on actual stories (did Jesus really stomp on a snake in the Garden of Gethsemane, and some other instances), but the movie was faithful to the biblical account of Jesus' death for the sins of the world and the Hollywood creativity  did not detract from the film's essence.  The film's setting (I think it was filmed somewhere in Europe) and atmosphere were also very powerful.While some people have problems with the movie's violent content (some people left the theater early when we went), Jesus' death was extremely violent.  Since Jerry Springer can let skeletons come out family closets and Hollywood can produce movies full of illicit sex, foul language, and mind-numbing violence, then why should a portrayal of the crucifixion be sanitized? The viewer's emotions are aroused and the person is challenged to really think about what he or she believes in terms of Jesus Christ and His claims. In short, the movie accomplishes what it sets out to do and is much more than just mere Hollywood entertainment.The only complaint I have with the movie is the emphasis on the crucifixion and not enough on the resurrection.  Of course, if Mel Gibson produces a sequel on Christ from the resurrection to His ascension, then this complaint is irrelevant (and I hope so too).For the Christian:  see the movie or buy or rent the dvd and be encouraged that you have a present and future hope in Jesus Christ!For the non-Christian:  expect to be aroused emotionally and  challenged intellectually about what you believe concerning  Jesus Christ and Who He said He was and is!	5.0	An Inspirational Movie of Hope for All!	2004-07-03	10	4	6

God's undying love ""AGAPE"" is so great and past anything that me or anyone reading this review can do to pay back.  All of our debts were paid off with Jesus Christ dying on the cross and paying for our sins with his blood.  In the movie it shows the violent death of Jesus Christ.  Ofcourse reading into the Word of God in Isiah 53 it prophesizes Jesus's death and in the New Testament books of Mark, Luke, John and Mathew it is written the events that took place that lead into this event (The Passion of The Christ) but we have to realize that Jesus died for all our sins, even the people that killed him and even for the people that until today don't believe in him.  You have to believe in the Son and know him in order to know the Father.  The Word of God is Jesus Christ.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	As everyone knows, Mel Gibson's film focuses on the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus.  From the Garden of Gethsemenie to turture to crucifixion to resurrection, Mel Gibson's movie is a emotional journey through the heart of Christian belief.  Is it bloody?  Yes.  Is it violent?  Yes.  Does that diminish its value?  Not in the least.  This movie is an unflinching view of Jesus' final hours that is powerful and moving.  mes Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern, and Monica Bellucci give stunning performances as Jesus, Mary, and Mary Magdeline respectively.  The emotions that they convey on their faces is heartbeaking.  As for the anti-Semitism, I did not see any.  I think that you will see what you want to see in this regard, although I do not believe contains any anti-Semitic views.  I recommend that everyone (Christian or not) take in a viewing of this amazing film.	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-03-11	6	3	3

I left every negative comment - mostly from the maintstream media - outside the theater.  I know, after viewing this movie - this love story, that it proves just how the media can get it WRONG. Not one person I know felt any sembelance of anti-semetic views.  Not one.  What we as Christians saw was Jesus taking on ALL our sins.  I will not use the word Violent with this movie.  It was graphic....it was difficult to watch...but, it was not Violent.  It showed just how much Jesus loves all of us.  To Mel Gibson, I say 'thank you' and I know you certainly had Divine help in making this movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A714QCXR5Z99U	Michelle	To say that this movie is a cinematic masterpiece is a gross understatement and quite simply fails to do it justice. Watching this movie is like walking into the Louvre and viewing an amazing piece of art. Every moment completely encapsulates you and stays with you, every pan of the camera, every heartbreaking injustice opens your eyes to what true strength is. Mr. Gibson created a breathtakingly beautiful film, we are lucky enough to  watch a moving piece of art unfold in front of our sometimes shocked, but always believing eyes. His casting was incredible, Jim Caviezel was absolutely stunning as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern's performance as the Virgin Mary was utterly tragic.As for the controversies that surrounded this film, you quite simply have to put all controversies aside the moment the film begins. Once you step foot into Mr. Gibson's profound experience of Jesus' Passion you can't help but feel changed.	5.0	Breathtaking	2004-08-31	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2W2TNB2Y7UG2	"Michelle Vinje fan ""Michelle"""	One of the best movies of the year. Forget the gore, forget the controversy. American Cinema is a visual medium and being such, employs the use of visual aspects to tell a story. The makeup and costumes and language is excellent. You will be emotionally moved by what you watch and yes, that's what movies are supposed to do. If I didn't cry at the end of Old Yeller, what kind of movie would that be? Visually the film is magnificent - from the serpent at the bottom of Satan's feet to the aerial view through God's teardrop after the crucifixion, this is a well-made movie and is recommended. After all, there is a reason why the movie made a ton of money - why should you be left out. Buy a copy today and watch it with your children. Answer their questions - and be honest. Why? Want to guess how many parents out there don't know where their children are 3 in the morning (or don't care)? This will bond father and son, mother and daughter, and vice versa.

Nothing whatever can redeem this homoerotic drivel that wasted two hours of my time and eight dollars of my money.  The slow motion ""special effects"" violence is unspeakably shocking and completely gratuitous; the devil character is laughable and the anti-Semitism is shameful.  This puts the blood and guts of Rambo into the league of the Bells of St. Mary's and raises the bar for future movies depicting torture.  I can't wait until Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat is made into a movie and Trujillo's thugs are allowed on screen.  They'll now have a movie-making excuse to have the Romans look like pikers.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"What has this country come to when a man can't make a purely inspirational retelling of a story that is the basis of his entire religious beliefs? Has America become a fascist state? Is the United States of America under Communist control? That would appear so with the immense outcry against Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ from the Jewish community who believes this will result in a resurgence of anti-Semitic feelings amongst the movie-going public, a claim that has no justification. Too many people in this country have fallen for the liberal lie of ""Separation of Church and State"" which does not exist in any shape or form in the United States Constitution. The only thing that comes close to that is the ""Establishment Clause"" which states that federal government will not choose any religion for the basis of its country nor will it restrict religious freedom. Hmmm ... That's funny! Doesn't sound like our country today, now does it? The liberals of this country view Christianity as pot religion, one that can be pushed around and restricted without so much as a peep from the believers. God forbid this film rejuvenates religious moral values in this country!The story, although based mostly on the Bible, has more of an association with ""The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ"" written by St. Anne Catherine Emmerich and St. Mary of Agreda's ""The Mystical City of God"", two sources that Gibson used directly while writing the script for the film. Jesus of Nazareth is known to his followers as a teacher and as the messiah of the Jewish people, whom prophets claimed would come and redeem them from original sin, but to his enemies, namely the Jewish High Priests and the Roman occupiers, he is a religious and political threat. A threat that must be gotten rid of as soon as possible before he creates an uprising, one that has been looming the horizon since the Roman Empire took control many years ago. So in the middle of the night, the High Priests arrest Jesus and in the morning present him to the Roman governor of Palestine, Pilate. Both he and King Herod find nothing to charge the man with but the Jewish people call for the prisoner to be crucified. In an effort to appease the crowd and prevent a riot, Pilate condemns Jesus to death. From there Jesus is forced to march through an angry mob while carrying his cross, nailed to that cross, and to die on that cross only to rise again, according to Christian beliefs, and save mankind from sin. The story for The Passion of the Christ sticks very true to its source, the Bible, and for that Mel Gibson should be praised not only for his accuracy in what he beliefs but also for not appealing to the unrelenting masses crying of anti-Semitism. In what was seen in the film, The Passion is more anti-Italian then anything else. There is no instance anywhere within the film that points directly to anti-Semitism; in fact it is the direct opposite. When the Jewish High Priests meet in the middle of the night to decide what to do with Jesus, two of the High Priests proclaim that the man is innocent and he should be set free but they quickly pushed away by the leader of the group. There are many other such moments that should all but silence the joke-of-a-claim made by Jewish leaders who have no idea what they are arguing against, let alone what is in the film.Instead of focusing on each member of the cast, all of which performed exceptionally well, let's concentrate more on the individual characters the actors and actresses portrayed on screen. Jesus Christ is portrayed in graphic detail through the emotionally driven performance of James Caviezel and the implacable choreograph of Mel Gibson. Jesus is portrayed exactly as he is in the Bible as a man of tremendous power who is beaten down by those who are, in actuality, lower then he is and yet he continues to press forward the message of forgiveness and love, not revenge. Maia Morgenstern conveys such an expressive motherly aura about her that when she performs on screen next to Jim Caviezel, it is utterly heart-wrenching to witness and could bring even the most virile of individuals to tears. Mary Magdalene, performed by Monica Bellucci, is once again misrepresented as a former prostitute whom Jesus saved from being stoned to death, which is a great misinterpretation that even today has gone unchanged. Unfortunately the story about Jesus saving the prostitute comes before Mary Magdalene is officially introduced in the Bible and therefore is often misunderstood. Rosalinda Celentano, who portrays Satan, gives a haunting performance that owes much to Gibson's vision of how he wanted the ruler of Hell to be represented in the film.Overall, The Passion of the Christ is quite possibly the most gut-wrenching, vicious and gore-filled interpretation of Jesus' death but at the same time it is the most emotionally-driven and praiseworthy one as well. The radical liberals and uptight religious leaders may lead many to believe that this adaptation of the gospels will cause anti-Semitic feelings but don't listen to single word they say because it is a flat-out lie! If people leave this feeling angry at the Jews then they have obviously missed the message Gibson and the Bible itself have tried to express, and therefore the filmmakers should not be held responsible for their foolish actions. Others claim that the feature is too violent and, once again, people have missed the point. Any interpretation of the death of Jesus should be graphic and the more violent it is, the more expressive the message of forgiveness and love should be. The only problem that could be seen in the feature was the inclusion of children representing demons, which just came off as being a little too awkward to be taken seriously, as well as the too many ""jump"" moments in the beginning, which came off as being too thriller-ish then anything else. Other then that, The Passion of the Christ is a definite must-see for both Christian and Non-Christians alike. Even if you aren't Christian, you will absolutely embrace the emotionally driven story and its clear-cut message that transcends religious barriers."	4.0	The Moose Hole - Gibson Shows His 'Passion'	2004-02-26	7	5	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AISC6RLV7IIKM	MickFromCanada	"I went to catholic school and I have read the bible a few times over the years (although not recently).  To me, the story of Jesus Christ is that of a life-affirming humanitarian who inspired others and set a wonderful example for how people can live their lives.  The story ends violently for Christ, as the power structure of his time necessarily made an example of him and taught others the consequences of his ideas and actions.  It is a lesson for those who want to challenge conventions (even in a peaceful manner).That being said, the whole idea of the crucifiction as the defining moment in the life of Christ seems odd to me as someone who is familiar with the story.  I'm not suggesting that Mel Gibson sees it this way, because I wouldn't know.  However, the fact is he deemed it important enough to make a movie based only on this moment of Christ's life.  It also seems strange to me that an institution that claims to becelebrating the life of Christ tends to focus so much on his crucifiction by depicting him dead or dying on the cross as the centrepiece of most catholic church ceremonies (aka: ""celebrations of life"").  I like what Lenny Bruce said: ""If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses"".So I guess Mel Gibson's film doesn't really misrepresent the practices of catholocism as some suggest; instead, it misrepresents the life of Jesus as it is described in the Bible.  Mel must be a Catholic to have made this movie, not someone with an interest in the life of Jesus Christ.What concerns me the most is that people paid to see this movie.  Your review/opinion means nothing if you have already paid to see/own it. Today's system of power and control over the masses is largely economic in nature, and the people who fund these kinds of movies measure the opinions of theiraudience in terms of what they pay for, not what they think. Your negative review of this film does not matter if you havealready paid to see it.  If you are trying to influence others not to rent or buy this movie, you shouldn't have paid for it yourself in the first place; as those who look to reviews for movie advice are likely to rent what sells most anyways.  For those of you who are religious and liked this movie, good for you! You are free to like it, and free to do as you're told.  If any Catholics out there are offended by these statements, don't feel like you have to write a reply; just forgive me...as I assume Jesus would have."	3.0	This is a review of the audience who paid to see this movie	2005-03-13	8	1	7

After watching this movie, reading the Passion text in the Gospels will give you a new experience.  You will know what suffering really is and how much the Lord loves us.  The movie also depicts how much our Lady suffered seeing her son being constantly beaten.  As she was told by Simeon, truely a sword pierced her heart as looked up his mutilated body.  The violence of the film is necessary to express the true nature of divine love, for many still fall short of understanding it.  The Lord's wounds are meant to heal us, not scare us.  The movie also showed how brutal the Romans were.  As an Italian, I am now ashamed to be a descendant of theirs.  Women are portrayed beautifully in this film, as gentle, kind, mercyfull and loving.  The men are portrayed as arrogant and cowards.  St. Luke would be pleased.  As for the Jews, showing two chief priests protest the trial (not in scripture), showing Simon defend Jesus against the Romans (not in scripture), showing the dozens of weaping Jewish women, showing Jesus clearly state that he freely chooses to sacrafise his life and that no other can take it way, and finally choosing a Jew to play Mary all convince me that this movie is free of anti-semitism.  Showing the devil in agony at the end and beautifully portrayed resurrection scene gets the point across that good defeated evil for our own sake.  Now I wish Mel would make another depicting the rise of Christianity, especially showing the passion of the martyrs and how Christendom finally defeated paganism.	5.0	The Ultimate Masterpiece	2004-09-13	11	8	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3GOK75HCAAG5B	Mike Wiese	"This movie depicts Jesus Christ's last living hours on earth and the crucifixion on the cross.I am sad to say this movie offers nothing more than violent images.No bad word for Mel Gibson though. Braveheart was a beautifully directed cinematic masterpiece done by him and writter Randal Wallace. It is a movie that depicts not only war, revenge and violence....it tells a story of a bond shared between two humans that could never broken not even after the death of one of them. It made me cry and feel pride for those who would be brave enough to take on a force stronger than anything in the Eastern Hemisphere, (at the time) the British Empire. Braveheart is about ambition, love and courage. Mel Gibson created a wonderful film.Sadly to say once more, ""The Passion of the Christ"" offers nothing more than violent images. I could sense nothing dramatic nor touching about the film.The beauty and passion and love of Jesus wasn't his last hours alive and how he was nailed to a cross and left to die. His passion and love was the time he was alive.If this movie wanted to show the great man Jesus really was, it shouldve shown more scenes of his teachings and love shown toward his fellow man. Its stupid to think that people are lashing out against Mel Gibson's movie, calling it innacurate and anti-semitic. This is a man's opinion and free will shown on the big screen and anyone with artistic feelings would appreciate that. Free will and creativity is a wonderful gift that God gave us, and Mel Gibson didn't manipulate it, this is just his vision and doesn't make him blasphemic or evil.Still I can't find anything worth while about his movie because it lacks important events of the greatest man that ever lived.The way the movie was shot was excellent but the story line was weak and ostintacious. I couldnt find any character development or suspense or drama in the film, i could only recognize the violent whippings and thrashings of Jesus' body, and him being crucified.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"It's difficult to rate a film in which a segment of filmgoers will find great meaning, while, for the rest of us it is, it is 2 hours of pointless tedium. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a gutsy but lackluster attempt to dramatize the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, from his prayers at Gethsemane until his death on the cross. It is a heavily embellished account -so much so that it is doubtful that it could all happen within 12 hours. This is really a ""bring your own context"" film. Those who don't know the story of Jesus' life won't be able to make heads or tails of ""The Passion"". The character of Mary Magdelene (Monica Bellucci), for example, gives the impression of being Jesus' sister, or perhaps another family member, not his follower. And Jesus (Jim Caviezal), himself, impresses as harmless and probably crazy when taken out of context, not as a credible threat to Jewish orthodoxy. We never see the intelligence or charisma that made this man legendary. The film is subtitled. All characters speak in dubiously accented Latin and/or Aramaic. But the facility with which the actors work in languages that they don't speak is interesting. -As are the film's colors. Actually, the colors are quite dull, but many scenes have an overwhelming blue or, more commonly, brown tone. The most notable aspect of ""The Passion"" is its haunting, prominently featured score by John Debney. The fact that ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a spiritual  inspiration for some of its audience is proof of its cinematic value, however. In order to arouse the emotions of its audience, a film must be doing something right for some people.Much of ""The Passion of the Christ"" has the quality of a vivid dream sequence. Its flashbacks, bizarre devil imagery, haunting soundtrack, long silences, and strange color casts give the impression of something that is not to be taken literally. There is meticulous attention to historical accuracy in some things, while in other matters  accuracy is inexplicably flaunted: Jewish children wearing skull caps, nails driven into hands instead of wrists, an unrealistic time frame, Jesus and Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) conversing in Latin, Monica Bellucci is old enough to be Mary Magdalene's mother, and she too often uncovers her flowing hair in public. Modern films are held to pretty high standards for historical accuracy in their appearance, although not in the behavior of characters. So it puzzled me that director Mel Gibson fell down on minor points that would not have detracted from the film in any way had they been more accurate, when he went so far as to have the characters speaking their native languages. Gibson, true to form, exaggerated the violence beyond what is described in the Gospels. There are only about 13 minutes of intense violence in the film, but it is presented for maximum effect. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is highly impressionistic in that it depicts and, indeed, extrapolates the elements of Jesus' last day on Earth that have meaning for screenwriters Benedict Fitzgerald and Mel Gibson, as manifested in their imaginations.""The Passion of the Christ""s opening sequence isn't its best, but it illustrates one reason  the film fell flat for me. The scene of Jesus imploring God to spare him in Gethsemane is entirely blue and so melodramatic that I could do nothing but laugh, I'm afraid. Of course this is a matter of interpretation and style. But people don't really act like that. It was a sign of more melodrama to come. ""The Passion""s melodrama is so heavy that it made me apathetic to even the most extreme suffering. It places the film's emotions beyond a realistic plane. A lot of the audience, Christians included, will find Jesus' behavior bewildering. He seems to deliberately incriminate himself before the Pharisees and all but asks for more torture from the Romans. He invites suffering, as if he were a masochist. All I can say is that the film is thoroughly Athanasian. To make a long story short for those who don't know, Athanasian Christianity emphasized the suffering of God, in the form of Jesus, to redeem the souls of humans. It was adopted as Christian orthodoxy in the 4th century. The emphasis on suffering is diminished in Protestant and many modern Catholic practices. But if Athanasian Christianity is your thing, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is your movie. Whether mainline Christians will appreciate ""The Passion""s theology is another matter. The implication that someone deserves to have his eye pecked out because he mocked Jesus demonstrates a different value system entirely from ""Forgive them. They know not what they do."" Ultimately, I found the monotonous persecution of one man for 2 hours to be, frankly, boring.The DVD: The are no bonus features, but there is an optional commentary for the visually impaired. A narrator recounts everything that happens on screen, including descriptions of the camera perspective, for the entire film. He even reads the credits. It's eloquent and  well-done. The default language is Latin/Aramaic/Hebrew with English subtitles. But Spanish subtitles and English captioning for the hearing impaired are also available."	3.0	You'll Either Love It, or You'll Fall Asleep.	2004-10-15	10	5	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A35S7OEY0MA46X	Mir Harven	"This brilliant work is something I could elaborate on weeks and weeks- on and on. Of course, for a review, only a few words will have to suffice. Essentially, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is for viewers who can empathize with the central soteriological myth of ""orthodox"", ie. Paul's & St. John's victorious version of Christianity. Gibson's film is profession and expression of this orthodox Christian (or Catholic- the role of Mary) creed: Satan screaming at the bottom of the hell testifies to it. Of course, one need not necessarily be a Christian to apprehend this, but must have the ability of, Germans would say, ""Einfuehlung""- emotional-spiritual capacity to allow themselves to be swept into vortex of this peculiar mindset that manifests in power to identify with the centre of centres of Christian image of consummation of human destiny: the salvation of mankind through redemptive suffering of the Word/Son of Man. This is embedded in the very protoplasm of Christian mythic consciousness. Without it, curious outsiders or watered-down insiders (liberal Protestants, Gnostic Christians, irreligious or indifferent moviegoers,..) can, at best, catch only fragments of the radiance the soteriological narrative. At worst: if a viewer can not (or does not bother to) catch the spiritual and ""theological"" context of the movie, then, I guess, the film will look like a procession of neverending senseless mutilation. Now I can understand (and appreciate) constant whining of numerous reviewers about ""too much violence"", ""sadistic spectacle"" etc. If you approach the film constantly outside a specific spiritual and mental framework, you will, in all probability, not behold the triumphant glory, the spiritual undersong that flows beneath of flagellations, lacerations and crucifixion- in short, you won't see that the Passion is the Redemption. And this is actually a harsh verdict on the state of faith of gore-screaming reviewers/viewers, the testimony of their sugarcoated and, I'd say, superficial and anaesthetized experience of life and human existence in general. The various categories of movie viewers will be affected, I guess, in radically different ways: spiritually sterile people (whether ""ordinary"" atheists or believers, doesn't matter) will react according to their basic temperament traits re violence and gory realism; cinematic connoisseurs caged into secular consciousness will catch only props that function just in order to convey the spiritual vision: the artistic or technical analyses are, taken outside context, ultimately, only food for bears. Viewed with the eye of spirit, and not soul, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a cleansing, purificating and liberating experience. A short glimpse on resurrection (masterfully crafted) provides the appropriate coda for the film that will, no doubt, reach those for whom is truly intended: those of a gentle spirit; who shall inherit the earth."	5.0	The Passion is the Redemption	2004-05-07	10	5	5

But, I decided to give it a second chance on DVD...it was even WORSE!  Here's the thing on this film, it's done based on the fact that we know who all of these characters are-NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?? I'd expect a lack of character development in a porno, but not something that is supposed to be so ""moving"" and ""important"".  So, yeah, I realize that most people know the story of Jesus and all that stuff...and I know the story, but this movie really didn't sell it for me.  Oh, and let's talk about the ""gore"" in this film...oh please!!!  The original Exorcist had better gore effects than this film!

Nothing in this movie or about this movie was non-biblical, EVERYTHING depicted in this *beautiful* & *realistic* movie was straight from the bible.

In previous films, we see Jesus portrayed on the cross without the cruel reality of actual physical elements. As a Christian, I live by the belief that Christ died for us. It is the basis of Christianity - Jesus, the Son of Man, the Son of God in the flesh, the One and Only begotten Son of God who came to this earth with one thing on His mind - to do the will of the Father. This movie is not only a movie, but it is a story in itself of what Christ went through for us. It realistically displays through slow motion and inch-by-inch the very last hours of Christ's sufferings, as the story told in the Chapter of Luke. It ministered to me and brought me back to the basics of why I believe and why I am a Christian. It is an awakening. This movie was filmed with careful thought. You can tell that Mel Gibson had carefully planned out every scene and worked on this film with such a passion to tell the story of Jesus. It is not just a movie, it's a ministry.	5.0	It is truly a Passionate Film!	2004-11-05	11	5	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	"This film has been receiving a lot of mixed reviews. Some are claiming that it is not an accurate interpretation of events. While others are saying that the film gives off an anti-semtic feel. Well, I had the pleasure of seeing Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" opening night, and I must say that it is one of the most powerful, moving, and violent films that I have ever seen in my life. For two hours, I was glued to the screen. I have never felt such a confliction of my emotions before. Part of me was disgusted at the violence and the overall treatment of Jesus. While the other part of me was amazed at how accurate the film was, and how well the film was captured on screen. Now some people might complain because there is not one word of english spoken in the entire film. However, the film is suprisingly easy to follow, and after the first 30 minutes you don't even realize the film is not in english anymore.James Caviezel continues to amaze me. He was brilliant in ""Frequency"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". But he was perfect in the role of Jesus. He not only looked the part, but he also brought the part to life. Every action of his on screen, made you feel for the character. It has to be one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen in my life. Maia Morgenstern was excellent as Mary as well. She accurately portrayed the love and sorrow that Mary felt for her son. There are two things about this film that might be confusing to the average movie-goer. The first is that the film showcases the last 12 hours of Jesus's life starting with the betrayal of Judas and ending with the crucifixtion. For those who don't know the history behind Jesus, it might be a tad bit confusing because there is no backstory. Mel Gibson did this because he wanted to focus on the most powerful and disturbing part of Jesus's life. The second is with the character Satan. You see Satan throughout the film, but it is never really made clear who he is. To the average person, he justs looks like one of the crowd dressed in black. I would have liked it, if there was more exploration into the character.Overall, the performances given and the accurate portrayal of events make ""The Passion of Christ"" a masterpiece that everyone should see.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ALRWU8OKXIB51	mjbarr01	The movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. For all the people who say that the movie is too violent, what did you expect ! Please remember this, no one can dispute whether or not Christ was actually beaten that brutally or not. No one that is living today was there. Movies are to stretch your imagination a little. The purpose of the violence in the movie to is to give you a sense of guilt. It is placed in the movie to grab your emotion. It is to make you feel remorse for some of the things that you have done in your life and that one man, Jesus, died for those sins so you can go to heaven and be with the Father. If you watch the movie with the notion that this is a violent movie, you have missed the purpose that Mel Gibson was trying to portray. Jesus suffered and sufffered a brutal beating, the ridicual while carrying the cross, and the pain of being crucified all for you and me.As far as anti-Jew, I could understand why people thought that. However, if you read the Bible, you will understand that the Pharisee thought Jesus was trouble and Jesus was taking their power away. They convinced an already stressed out Pilate to crucify Jesus.Lucifer, the devil, satan is portrayed in this film. Each time s/he (portrayed by a woman) is present it flashes back to a younger Christ and when He could have given in to Satan and not followed through with His destiny and not die for our sins.I recommend anyone who has not seen this movie to see it. I would not recommend this for anyone under the age of 18 or 19. Any younger than this might not be able to comprehend the true meaning of the film. I know a few adults that missed the meaning too. It is a powerful movie that will bring you closer to God and Jesus.

I get it.Jesus really really really suffered.A lot.Maybe I didn't need to see his skin flayed off in little ribbons by the 'cat-o-nine-tails' whip thing with the hooks on it.This inexorably painful movie shows the whole Jesus, carry-the-cross, crucifixion thing in exquisite detail.It was agony to sit through.I think that was the intended emotion that Gibson wanted to evoke.However competently it was done (and this is an amazing looking and sounding film), the horrific scenes...one after another...are revolting, nauseating, wince-inducing and will make the skin crawl.I watch a lot of movies...all kinds including horror/exploitation-type flicks...and this is the closest I've ever come to turning away from the screen.I also think you have to know a little bit about the story beforehand. This is not for the Christian novice.Many characters are never identified by name, and certain scenes are depicted in almost cinematic shorthand...when you see the feet of Jesus in an empty courtyard, with a few dozen rocks strewn about and the hand of a woman reaching for Jesus...you are supposed to know the whole thing about the adulteress, the ""ye without sin"" casting stones, etc.My take on the material was in noting that this is a story of the ultimate religious persecution. Here is the person with the ""ultimate"" religious conviction. He does not only believe in the Son of God and the Messiah, he believes he IS said person.For those beliefs, he clearly suffers the ""ultimate"" punishment, and is the victim of the most severe form of religious intolerance.Just my little interpretation.Overall, I felt exhausted and spent by the end of what felt like a four-hour movie. I agree with other reviewers that it's not really a film to like or dislike.It's a five-star production, but in terms of content, I'll never need to see it again."	4.0	The ultimate religious persecution, now on celluloid.	2004-12-30	6	3	3

It's really a moving account of Christ's life.  really realistic of what he went through i'm sure.  It really makes you appreciate the love Jesus had to endure such a brutal cruxifiction and death on the cross for his creation.  It's really a moving film.  It's true it has a lot of blood and violence, but as it's a real interpatation of the cruxifiction I can understand that.  Besides to me one of the scariest parts and one I think they over did was showing the demon so often and dwelling on the negative instead of showing some of the more postive like angels and the ressurection at the end and Assumtion of Mary.  But overall I really liked it and think it changed a lot of people's lives for the better after seeing it. I know it did for my cousin.  I'd recommend it to any Christian you don't have to be Catholic to appreciate it.I think it is one of the best movies about Christ.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3RLEKKHVJBB5L	mk915	"The Passion of the Christ is a pretty decent movie.  Let's get one thing out on the table first though.  It is NOT antisemitic by any means whatsoever.  It shows what happened and does not send any message that Jews are solely responsible for Jesus' crucifixion.  We as humans are responsible and the movie conveys that.  Anyone who blames Jews for Christ's crucifixion is warped simply because the Jews just happened to be the people which Jesus appeared before and Judaism was a religion with a large population much like itself and Christianity today.  It was more than likely the best possible group for Jesus to preach to since his teachings would spread over such a large population.The movie's purpose was to show how much Christ suffered both physically and emotionally during the final 12 hours of his life.  The movie definitely accomplished that goal, however, it did not provide any spiritual feel.  Reason being simply that most if not all movie's which depict Christ are not always accurate to the Bible and are often interpretations of the producer as to what happened.  An example on Gibson's part is his use of the Devil.The movie shows how cruel and hypocritical we as people can be, especially when the crowd shouts ""Crucify him"" despite his already immense suffering and when just 5 days earlier people in Jerusalem were greeting Jesus with Palms (this image is shown in the movie, which to me was the most powerful).  Finally, the ending (Christ's Resurrection) was too brief in that Gibson doesn't show Christ appearing before the disciples bringing them joy and hope and misses out on the main point of Christ's suffering and death (which is to defeat death by death).Overall, the movie was good, but only in spurts.  It had both well done and poorly done images.  Some people may say that this movie is spiritual, but those people who say it is spiritual are the ones who are deeply affected by gore and visuals.  But to me, going to Church and witnessing the Crucifixion on Holy Thursday (at least in Orthodox Churches) and reading the gospel give you a much more spiritual feel.The movie is definitely worth seeing, but it is just what I said, an okay movie.

People today have the luxury of not watching someone get beat to death.  I think when people walked out of the theater, they felt what Jesus went through, not just witnessed him get called names and hit a couple times.Mel made a movie about Jesus Christ, not Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer.Of all the violent films over the past few years, why is this one the movie labeled as ""REALLY violent?""  Simple, it deals with religion and atheists have to find a reason to belittle it.Ok... I'm off my soapbox.  The movie is spectaculor.  When your kids get a little older, sit with them and watch it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"""The Passion of the Christ"" is like no other movie I have ever seen.  It is difficult to see this as a film, when really it is an experience that, like it or not, you are immersed in for two hours and come out physically and emotionally drained, even if you found yourself without expression the entire time.  the film, er... experience enraptures you almost immediatetly, as the film picks up the Garden of Gesthemine.  Jesus (Jim Cavielzel) is in fear of what he must do, but finds himself tempted by a strange, female androgynous form of Satan.  Seductive and oddly sexy, Lucifer, with an alluring, otherworldy voice tempts Jesus to turn from his path, but Jesus stays the course, accepting the arrest by Jewish guards.  Condemed by the Jewish council for blasphemy, Jesus is taken before Pilate for punishment.  pilate initially finds no cause for death, and instead orders Jesus whipped.  This is where the violence and gore kick in.  Jesus' back and torso is methodically ripped apart by Roman chastisers, and director Mel Gibson focuses on all the gory details, with close-ups of flesh coming off in shreds and the claws often come dangerously close to his face.  Add to this a graphic walk with the cross (he is whipped repeatedly with a belt) and an even worse crucifixtion (complete with nails driven into Jesus' hand and feet, accompianied by squish sound effects and aa theif's eye pecked out by a crow), and the violence is often too much, bringing the audience out of the emotional juggernaut and leaving them instead with nausea.But the films' saving grace is Romanian actress Maia Morgernstern as Jesus' mother Mary.  I am a congregational protestant, and never gave Mary the same amount of reverance Catholics do.  But now I may.  Morgenstern is the films' heart and soul, amid the films' unrelenting gore.  She is the human mother watching her only son beaten and tortured to death.  She is the main focus in the films' most powerful and moving scene when Jesus falls carrying the cross and she flashes back to an event in his childhood, whe she was able to comfort him and shleter him from pain. The humaness of Mary is what is relatable in the film (Cavielzel doesn't act as much as offer himself up as a sacrifical lamb) as the helpless mother, and Morgenstern's stoic yet anguished performance is one of the most heart-breaking you will ever see, and is the most haunting aspect of ""The Passion,"" rising above the film's off-putting violence."	4.0	"At Times ""Passion""ate"	2004-03-08	6	2	4

It is no worse then any other R rated movie out there.  I am not saying it WASN'T brutal and violent, yes, I do think it was very brutal, but not as much as I thought with all the talking about this movie.Everyone needs to know the religious meanings of the movie before they review it such as: When Jesus said he would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days. He wasn't actually talking about a real temple, but instead Himself. He was the temple and He rose up in three days after He died.  Why didn't Jesus just use His power to stop the suffering or just perform a miracle for Herod so it would never had happened?  Because He knew it had to be done to carry and then destory the sins of the world, past, present, and future.  Why didn't Mary try and stop the suffering?  Because, like Christ, she also knew it had to be done.Even for me at the age of fourteen, this movie has highly affected me as it would an adult.

But here it has a noble purpose. (this is not Sin city or Reservoir dogs) Read the gospels. Our Saviour didn't come here for pleasure, or for chatting with Herod, drink some wine, have wonderful feasts and marry a beautiful girl (some fools say he married Mary Magdalene)and be eternally happy as Hollywood wants us to believe. No. He came here to redeem us. He came here to show us how a Christian should face suffering And above this, he came here to show us the real face of the Father, Our Father that is LOVE. Seeing this movie is seeing how much Jesus loves us. Meditation  of The Passion of the Christ is the DEVOTION of Devotions. A lot of conversions have occurred after people started meditating these sufferings of Our Lord. ALL the Saints have meditated them and had a profound devotion for them. Even more, they recommended this devotion in order to obtain real sanctity of life, because the REAL LOVE (only somebody that is willing to suffer like this and die for you , really loves you!) attracts LOVERS.Regarding the accusations of ""antisemitism"", I just have one recommendation. It is not a secret that Jews hate Jesus and His Church. This movie only describes  what really happened according to the Gospels. A sympathetic Sanhedrin  would be a lie. They wanted Jesus dead and that's what Mel shows us in this movie.

Stories of there lives and hardship is always told since childhood. Mel's version is very close to ours, which is ironic because it shows how much all Christians, Jews, and Muslims have in common yet we keep fighting and hating each other. For me, the movie was a massage of peace not violence as many people perceived.I was amazed of how close Aramiac is to Arabic. I had no trouble understanding lots of the dialogue.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1845IJB63D5H7	"Mohamed F. El-Hewie ""Mohamed F. El-Hewie"""	As a Muslim, I went to see this movie to check the strength of my Islamic belief. I came out more educated about how Christians view religion and how their views differ from those of Muslims.Mel Gibson has packaged the common beliefs of his contemporary generation about Christianity in a commercial and artistic production with total disregard to the essence of any religion. He emphasizes the torture and persecution of a prophet and brutality and prejudice of his tormentors without shedding any light on the mission of the prophet. The movie portrays Christ as a psychotic man being punished by an angry community for blaspheming their faith in an almighty supreme God.Thus, the movie leaves one with the impression of sympathizing with a poor, persecuted man without explaining why his mission is worth believing in. The movie also portrays the Romans to be more civilized than the Jews of those days for their resistance to punish a poor man for his beliefs.The movie widens the gap between Christianity and other religions, one for reducing a holly prophet to the level of an insane man, and two for stressing on the common obsession among Christians of the person of the prophet instead of his deeds, mission, and wisdom. All Muslims believe that their prophets (including Jesus, Ibraham, Moses, and Muhammad) died as men like the rest of us and only their missions will remain alive because of its applicability to everyday matters. That completely opposes the movie's theme of focusing on the affairs of personal torture without attempting to demonstrate the relevance of his mission to today's problems.	5.0	Great movie, lousy on mission	2005-01-30	18	6	12

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3U3KDEPUEF75R	momo	For the first time in my life, when it comes to discussing a film, I've been rendered nearly speechless. Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ,' which depicts the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus, defies the typical `it's good' or `it's bad' mentality of a review. It's so visually gripping, so heart-wrenching and so emotionally draining that writing about it simply can't do it justice.Gibson, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, went to great lengths to make sure his film was Biblically accurate and it shows. Jesus (played brilliantly by James Caviezel, `Frequency') looks Jewish, instead of the blond-haired, blue-eyed man usually seen in the role. Every line spoken is in Aramaic or Latin (with English subtitles). Every prop used, from whips and swords to clothing and wigs, looks stunningly authentic. What emerges is the most realistic depiction of Christ's suffering ever put on screen.Most films about Jesus begin at His birth, give a kind of Cliff's Notes glance-over of His life, and make crucifixion seem slightly unpleasant - not `Passion.' The film is entirely about the journey to that specific event and shows it's possibly the most horrific method used to kill someone. `Passion' begins as Jesus agonizes in the Garden of Gethsemane, so troubled by His upcoming duty that His sweat turns to blood.As He prays, He fights a spiritual battle. He knows He must die and, despite leading a sinless life, take on the sins of mankind so they can be saved. He has been abandoned by His followers. He is constantly tempted by Satan, who tells Jesus that one man can't possibly die for everyone's sins. After setting aside His own will and seeking His Father's, Jesus is betrayed by Judas Iscariot (one of His disciples) and handed over to Jewish authorities and eventually the Roman government.What follows is an unflinching look at the way Christ was killed. His beatings, scourging and eventual crucifixion at the hands of Roman soldiers is shown in graphic detail. Where other films would cut away, `Passion' zooms in - every punch, every piece of flesh ripped away, every drop of blood, every thorn in His crown and every nail driven into His body is vividly captured on camera.The film is slightly over two hours long, starts with Christ's arrest in the Garden and ends with His resurrection (covered in about 12 seconds). Everything between is His brutal suffering and it is relentless. There are several brief flashbacks to earlier times in Christ's life to provide a short relief from the violence, but none long enough for the audience to forget what they are watching.The controversy that has surrounded `Passion' in recent months (consisting mostly of claims that it's anti-Semitic) is unfortunate. Yes, some Jews are responsible for the death of Jesus. But so are some Romans and, most importantly, so are the rest of us. Everyone, whether literally or symbolically, placed Jesus Christ on that cross to die. The film in no way implies that the Jewish nation as a whole is to blame for killing Him.As a Christian, this film is a wake-up call. I've always known that Jesus suffered and died for me. I even know the physical things that happen during a scourging and crucifixion. Seeing the process right in front of you, however, is a completely different matter. I have never cried as hard as I did during `The Passion of the Christ.' As I watched Jesus being beaten, spit upon, whipped to near-death and ultimately nailed to a piece of wood, all I could keep thinking, over and over again, was `He did that for me. He did that for all of us.'C.S. Lewis once said that Jesus could only be one of three things: Lord (as He said He was), a liar or a lunatic. Before viewing `The Passion of the Christ,' and strongly reinforced afterward, there is only one option for me. Whether Christian or non-Christian, I strongly urge you to see this film.	5.0	the passion	2005-03-06	14	13	1

I don't see how anyone can enjoy this film of suffering, but you can learn from it and appreciate this sacrifice shown in brutal detail. Jim Caviezel beautifully played Christ, and I really felt his suffering jump off the screen as if my own soul was being tortured. The film was much more violently graphic and gory than even I suspected, and I have seen almost every splatter horror film ever made (Dead Alive anyone?). But the real diffrence is that ""The Passion of the Christ"" has an emotional impact that goes hand in hand with the violence portrayed. This really happened and the violence was extreme, probably more so than the movie even shows.

Yes, this film does have its fair share of it, and your body is tired at the end from wincing - but there is much more to it then that, much more beauty. (...)The cinetography is superb [very 'Mel Gibson', who also directed Braveheart, another of my favarite movies], its brilliantly presented in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, and is very close to the words of the Bible, or so my mother tells me. Jim Caviesal and the rest of the cast (including the lovely Monica Bellucci, who is far better then she was in The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) excel in their parts, speaking their lines with the fluency of a native speaker. The sets are realistic and awe-inspiring, and I love the music, it completes the film with a flurish.After watching it, I think all of that anti-jew banter is totally overblown (...). Yes, it does suggest the jews were responsible for putting Jesus to the cross, yet all of the horrifying details [the scourging, the crown of thorns], all were performed by the Romans, while the jews looked on and had doubts about what they had done.I shall definately buy this on DVD, being an engrossing and beautiful addition to my collection, and to yours.	5.0	One of the most amazing FILMS I have ever seen!	2004-04-10	4	3	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1O768433DY6B3	"Morgana1986 ""Morgana"""	The Passion of the Christ has got to be one of the most contraversial films I have ever seen since the beginning of my very existance on this planet!WARNING SPOLIERS AHEAD!It all starts out with Jesus (Jim Caviezel whom I give major credit to for playing the doomed Jesus Christ)in some garden with his followers, and while Jesus is talking with the Devil, Judas goes to the Jewish officials and turns Jesus over to them.  Jesus is arrested, not long after that, his mother Mary, tells his wife Mary Magdalene that her instint senses something wrong.Later they find out that Jesus has been arrested, and the Jews are now surrounding Jesus, they yell at him for claiming that he was the son of God or the Messiah.  Then Judas starts feeling very guilty and even has the devil stocking him, the next day Judas hangs himself in shame.  Also that day the Jews turn Jesus over to the Romans, and they for some stupid reason choose to relase a sadistic, ugly, cycloptic murder over the gentil handsome Jesus.Later on, Jesus is getting the crap beat out of him, then he's whipped so many times, then he has to carry his own cross on his back.  And the Roman solders are pretty drunk from what I could see.  Oh and it gets much more worst from here on, while Jesus is carrying his cross on his back, the Romans are whipping him even more, and he trips.  Then they order a common man to help him carry the cross.  At first he refuses, but then ends up feeling sorry for him in the end, just like a lot of other people.Then Jesus is nailed to the cross and just sits up there asking God to forgive the Jews and the Romans for killing him, and just when he thinks that God has abadoned him, he dies.SPOLIERS END HEREI would like to say that watching this movie has made me feel very confused inside.  But there are some obvious things to point out though.1.  When it came to Jesus getting tortured, of course I felt sorry for him, regardless of weither or not he was just a common man or the Son of God.  And you can see how hard it was for Mary his mother to see her son suffer, and how hard it was for her to lose him.  That could be said of anyone who has ever lost a child.  But let's put it to you this way, if you don't want to see Jesus Christ get tortured, then don't watch this film. When watching a typical film, I could probably only stand to see someone get torchered for a half an hour, but not two hours, espically if it's Jesus.  That poor guy didn't even shout a single insult at anyone, even when everyone chose the murder to be let go over him.2.  It didn't just show Jesus getting tortured, it also showed flashbacks of him helping people and asking them to forgive and love their enemies.  I'm glad that Mel Gibson did put those flashbacks in there.3. Now for the most contraverasial point I would like to bring up.  First off I don't think that anyone should just go pointing fingers at the Jews, it not only sounds anti-Semetic, but you also left out an important detail, that the Romans were the ones who ordered the execution of Jesus Christ.  Think about the time that this happeend, back then if anyone claimed to be the Son of God then yes he's very likely to die, it was as risky as Joan of Arc claiming that she could talk to God.  Plus don't forget that the Romans were in charge of Israel at the time this happened, and don't also forget that the Romans believed in many Gods, so they probably would have put Jesus to death anyways.4. And not all the Jews were against Jesus either, most of his followers were Jewish, and I can only recall one of them that betrayed Jesus, that was Judas.  Paul may have looked like he betrayed Jesus, but in the end Jesus forgave him, because he knew that if Paul would have backed him up, then he too would have died.  And I don't think that Jesus wanted to put his followers in jepordy, otherwize, who would be left to preach Jesus's teachings?  Also Mary Jesus's mother was a Jew, and his so-called wife Mary Magdalene was a Jew, so were they against him?  I also saw that some of the Jews actually felt sorry for him when he was walking with his cross on his back.5. One last important detail, Jesus was a Jew, so anyone who hates Jews probably hates Jesus too.That's all I have to say, and with all that said and done, I have nothing else to say, except, if you want to watch a very powerful film like The Passion of the Christ then do so.	4.0	A Very, Very Contraversial Religous Film Indeed!	2008-10-05	3	1	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A228JH8V9Y700G	MortensOrchid	When I came into this movie, I tried to seperate myself from the hype.  I didn't want to be a part of a church group or some religious leftist sect who was adoring this movie (I was actually out on a date that night with a nice Jewish boy seven years my junior and I'm Catholic - HA!).You try and try to seperate yourself from this movie, to pretend that you have absolutely no idea what this story is about, but it's impossible.  Live action brings so much more to light about the story, especially since it's so gory and graphic.  All around you there are people crying, gasping with the lashes and screams of pain.  There isn't one person on earth, past, present or future, who doesn't know this story.  Look at how cruel people really are.  Look at how they humiliate and destroy others all for their own gains.  And look at Jesus the whole time.He FORGAVE them.I do not consider myself an overly religious person.  I go to church twice a year (Christmas and Easter) to make my mom happy.  I do try, however, to do the right thing and look out for my fellow man.  Maybe it's a little ridiculous and PollyAnna of me, but that's what it's all about plane and simple.  I also don't want to go through life being a bitter person either, which is why we have to practice forgiveness.  It's quite simple really.But I don't believe Jesus really loved us.  He forgave us because we didn't know what we were really doing.  In many situations people know exactly what they are doing, and do it with full intent.  And they will hurt you, but you will forgive them somehow.  Don't believe me or agree with me?  That's fine.  I know Jesus had passion for us.	5.0	Forgive us because we know not what we do	2005-10-04	11	1	10
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A222AIW06ERYM2	Moses Avalon	I know, I know, Gibson is an anti-Semitic nut, but this is still a great film. Gibson takes a good amount of creative license (and rarely passes up an opportunity to slam non-belivers) but most of the time I like his creative choices. Particularly the flashbacks (which are not in the source material) of younger Jesus and his mother.Is it an Anti-Semitic film?  Only if you focus on the &#34;bad Jews&#34; and ignore the fact that EVERY ONE of Jesus's supporters are also Jewish. Pilot is practically a saint in this version; torn between conscious and duty, which is a Gibson choice that is historically inaccurate, but one that is necessary for the film's narrative. Don't look to this film for a history lesson, but rather a version of the story that shows how confident Jesus was in his mission.Bloody?  Yeah, we could have done without some of it.  But it's nothing we have not already seen in gangster films, and Spartacus.  I take a way one star for that. and one-half star for historical inaccuracy. (Amazon will not allow half-star reviews so I rounded up)Gibson choices that I didn't like:1) Barabus looks like a retard when history has confirmed that he was a calculating Zealot leader against the Romans. Gibson's deviation to fashion Barabus a fool makes the mob calling for his freedom over Jesus look ridiculous and robs the audience not familiar with history of the significance of the crowd's reason for this choice.2) Herod acts like a young child when history has shown that was a very crafty politician whose alliance with Rome  gave the region prosperity and quazi-independence over the iron fist of Rome. Gibson's choice here robs the audience not familiar with history of understanding why Herod MUST hand Jesus back to Pilot and offers only that Herod is displeased with Jesus because he will not perform parlor-trick miracles.  Bad choice Mel.  Give your audience a bit more credit.Over all, if you can wade through the historical inaccuracies (which I can forgive b/c let's face it, movies are just one person's view) this is really a great piece of filmmaking and one that I personally did not find offensive for non-believers.  Having said that, it's pretty clear what Mr. Gibson thinks of that group of people largely responsible for his career.  Okay, so I won't invite him to my Purim party, but I can still appreciate his talent. Right?	4.0	Easy to be a hater, but...	2013-05-14	2	1	1

There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him, she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype, the film is highly emotional and disturbing.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A34JCDB3DPJ1I5	moviefreak2255	"The Passion. This movie makes me think about how much Jesus suffered for us on the day of his crucifixion. This movie is about the last twelve hours of Jesus' life. In some points of the movie, it goes back in time with Jesus and his apostles before he was captured and crucified. It is terrifyingly gruesome and depressing, but it is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I like how they make it as realistic as possible with the language they speak. They speak Aramaic, an ancient language which was used by Jesus and everyone else at that time. The language is now considered as the ""dead language."" The language is close to Hebrew. So there are subtitles throughout the whole movie. They are not many words in this movie. It is mostly the pain Jesus went through for us. The movie is very well done, Mel Gibson should be proud. This not, however a movie you will watch every single day, that would be too much to handle. I think people who don't want to go see this movie, but think they have to, don't. It is really not a required thing to do for yourself. A lot of people would not be able to handle this movie, especially kids. I'm thirteen and saw this movie and it was the most gruesome thing I have ever gone through in my life. This movie does not give you a good feeling when you leave the theatre. That doesn't mean that it is not a superb movie because it is. It was amazing. I really think it is up there with Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The only different thing about this movie is that it really actually happened, which makes it even harder to handle. I think this movie is a classic.

I am neither catholic nor jewish, in fact I'm not brain washed into any such faith, and as such I was able to enjoy The Passion of The Christ as a cinematic experiance like no other.  Watching the film was harrowing and definately inspired emotions as no other movie I have ever watched has - and that is what makes this such a triumph - it is an incredable feat on the part of Mel Gibson and all concerned to create a film that reaches out and touches people in such a way - even those who do not subscribe to the beliefs of the film makers themselves.Getting back to religion for a moment - the fact that it may or may not be an accurate potrayal of the gospels is neither here nor there - surely, it is more valid that it is a visual representation of the beliefs of a catholic.At the end of the day, if you don't like this film, why not just go buy Schindler's List and comfortably reaffirm your persecution complex from the comforts of your home?	5.0	narrow minded zealots ruin everything...	2004-07-01	8	1	7

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1NMUSODK9RHAT	Mr. Maybe	I'm going to warn you now...I am reviewing this film as an OBJECTIVE MOVIE-GOER, not a religious zealot. If you think just because of the subject matter this film should be considered immune from criticism, it may be best to skip my words here.For those of you still with me...This film could have been so good, yet falls short in so many ways. First of all, though not devoutly religious, I have no doubt that Christ existed and have read the Gospels. Religion, especially in film, is so subjective, it's nearly impossible to classify it in any conventional sense. This film is obviously driven by Mel Gibson's undeniable faith, and at times it shines brightly. I give it high marks for intensity, but I wouldn't call it moving or spiritually enlightening.First of all, the good: the subtitles are an excellent device. I thought it offered great authenticity to what could be defined as the single most revered day in history. Technically, I thought the cinematography, visual effects and score were also excellent. The roles of Jesus, Pilate and Mary were well done for the most part. In fact, perhaps the most captivating part of the film was the relationship between Jesus and Mary, though even that was barely touched upon. And again, the relationship between Pilate and his wife Claudia were better captured than the compassion for Christ.The bad: Just about everything else. In terms of a film, we expect an arc of story, or a plot. This film offers none. It's not a story, it's a sequence. Had Gibson focused more on Christ and who He was and what He taught, this film would have packed way more of a punch. It also might have sent a more profound message instead of what I took it as, which is sheer guilt.The acting, especially on the parts of the Romans, seemed very forced and cartoon-ish. The Jewish high priests were also one dimensional. The bloodshed, though at first effective, quickly became the focus of the film instead of why we should care that it's happening. I don't think that the bloodshed was unnecessary, but certainly excessive and over the top. It's good to see the darkest aspects of what Christ endured, but there comes a point where all Gibson's doing is establishing that torment, over and over and over. Nothing moves forward, it's just regurgitation.Gibson doesn't offer any reason for us to care what's happening. I found myself relating to it strictly from a humanity standpoint, where I sympathized with Jesus only out of compassion for his physical endurance. But I felt the same for Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, where he plays the part of a convicted rapist and murderer condemned to death. Hmmm, what's wrong with this picture?As an example of misdirection, instead of making the March to Golgotha scene several minutes long, shorten it up. Use the rest of that time to COMPLETE the scenes of the Last Supper, or the Sermon on the Mount. These snippet scenes, that consist no more than 15-20 seconds each, are the only link to who Christ was or allowed me to feel connected spiritually. But the second I was compelled by that, it's back to the torture and bloodshed. I'm sorry, but that's just HORRIBLE writing and directing. Seriously.I think my biggest complaint is the message here, which is guilt, guilt, guilt. Regardless of Gibson's intent, that's all that was conveyed as far as I'm concerned. I interpret the teachings of Christ to be that of love, forgiveness and peace. And though there are glimmers (and I mean glimmers) of those teachings in the film, they are too sparse to compensate for the bloodshed. And though I am familiar with the Gospels and understood everything that was happening, from beginning to end, I still left scratching my head. Bottom line, if you're not familiar with the story of Christ and His death, this is a very hollow film.And to quickly touch base on all of the controversy this film has stirred, here's my two cents: I don't think the film is anti-Semitic. I didn't have a hard time with the gore or bloodshed. I think it's pretty strange to read people's reviews that INSIST you take your kids to see this film, and it should be used as a teaching device, when really, it teaches NOTHING about who Christ was, or what He taught.I commend Gibson for his faith and vision to bring something to life that has affected his life in profound ways. THAT is truly amazing, and in my opinion, the very essence of faith and what it can do to mend souls. But in terms of a commercial film to be shown to the masses, there's really not a whole lot here.I wonder, would Christ Himself approve of this film's focus? I highly doubt it.	3.0	So much potential squandered...	2008-07-31	4	2	2

If you enjoyed this movie, there is a good chance you have an undiagnosed mental illness. There are so many things wrong about it that I almost don't know where to start but the main thing that stands out for me was the fact that it only deals with two or three days out of Christ's life, and assumes that the viewer knows all there is to know about what came before his arrest, trial, torture, and execution. The graphic scenes of brutality and violence are blatantly gratuitous and I still as yet have no idea what Mel wanted me to think or feel as a result of seeing this, and honestly - I don't really want to know. He could have made a movie about the life and works of Jesus of Nazareth...gone into his teachings, his message of hope but instead we get to see Him turned into bloody hamburger by the end of the movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AOWQ2SLNTZIJ4	"Mr. Robinson ""theo deo"""	"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" was probably one of the most controversial films of the year 2004. The film had many critics of all stripes praising or damning the work for a variety of different reasons.The most common criticism concerned Gibson's treatment of the Jewish authorities who demanded Jesus' death. This being a cinematic version of a ""Passion Play,"" staged shows depicting the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus, presented around Easter during the Middle Ages on. These productions were notorious for placing the blame of Jesus' death on the Jews and would reportedly lead audience members to track down Jews with harmful intent. Many feared the film would reignite the same sorts of emotions early passion plays had.I'm not sure if I feel qualified to judge the film on the grounds of whether there were undercurrents of antisemitism in its images and portrayals. Others also stated how the film was a sort of sadomasochistic torture fantasy revealing more about the demons in Mel Gibson's mind than any insights into Christ's sacrifice.While these were all valid criticisms, not many of the mainstream reviewers seemed to really critically focus on the theology of what the film was centered around. This, for me, was where the real problem with the film lie; in the theology it was celebrating.At the heart of traditional and popular Christian belief, is the idea that Jesus came into this world with the purpose of living a sinless life so he could offer himself up as perfect sacrifice for everyone's sins. As popular and as accepted as this theology is, it is warranted a closer inspection.It basically suggests that God, in order to forgive us and restore us to Paradise after our ""fall from grace"" as it were, needed a perfect sacrifice as we could not hope to make such an offering on our own. This blood offering was needed or we would all be under God's impending wrath. Culturally, this may have made sense over 2000 years ago, but does it do so now?As Darwin's theory of evolution shows, we were never perfect to begin with, we're not finished, to paraphrase Bishop John Shelby Spong. This is probably partially why the theory is such a threat to so many fundamentalist believers, as it implies that we didn't need a ""saviour"" to restore us to grace. Though, I should point out that many feel evolution and traditional Christian theology surrounding the atonement are compatible, I have never fully understood it.It paints God as an angry and cruel parent wanting the blood sacrifice of his own son in order to spare us his wrath. As one writer notes, its almost as if Jesus dies to save us, not from sin, but from his own Father. Seen through that lens, one gets the sense that this image of God is more bloodthirsty than loving.However, the film is a no holds barred portrayal of that form of atonement in action. Before Jesus is scourged, he lets his Father know his ""heart is ready"" for what will happen. Therefore, while being whipped (endlessly) I almost felt that the scourgers were mere pawns as God himself was directing this abuse towards his own son.Many feel a sense of love when contemplating this view of Jesus' death and thus will not like the view I have taken. That's fine. I simply feel the view I have shared was not expressed by critics enough, and felt a need to share it myself.The film itself is gorgeous to look at with great cinematography and a moving score. The actors all handle their dialogue and characters effortlessly, which must have been difficult speaking in another language.But, the film's emphasis on gore and showing it ""how it was"" really numb the senses. Its hard to focus on much else when all one sees is whips striking Christ's back over and over again.In the end, I left the theater asking, why would an almighty and all powerful God, with powers and abilities beyond our comprehension choose the most violent means by which to transact grace and forgiveness. This strict absolutist image of God only puts him in a corner and a narrow one at that."	2.0	"Mel's Ode to ""Tough Love?"""	2005-04-18	12	4	8

The theme that rang true throughout this whole movie was Love. Christ's unselfish act of sacrifice and love was truly remarkable.I would recommend this movie to any one who desires to understand why and how our Saviour was persecuted for our sake.	5.0	Magnificent depiction of Christ's undeserved Passion for Us	2004-02-29	1	1	0

You have to be moved to see this if not the first time, then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen, BEFORE Jesus came into their life.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1S4SB7VPQBEDN	Mrs. N. Niaz	Though I may rate it as a 5 star movie, but the truth is that it is unrateable. There are scences which were full of violence and sadistic environment, and there are scences of great pain and emotions flowing, but this does make a difference in making the movie captivating. Personally, I have seen what Chrsit has achieved being a Man and after the resurrection as God. This movie will make you cry even if you are a Believer or not.The very touching scenes of the movie was pain of Mary, Mother of Christ.As far as the flogging scene is concerned, it wasn'st very gross. Even though I have seen many violent movies I couldnt tolerate the flogging of Christ because of the sadistic way the Roman soldiers were torturing Him.The fiction of having Satan (sometimes a man or a woman) around was quite good.I would recommend this movie to everyone, if you are Christian or not. This movie will grow on you very quickly.	5.0	The Passion is trully Unrateable!	2004-03-30	4	3	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1KI6L82M5RAHQ	mr. snrub	"Only Mel Gibson would be bold enough to make his version of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST in Latin and Aramaic, and make it so relentlessly violent that I saw at least five people in the theatre leave to throw up (I almost did myself during that awful ""scourging"" scene.)Mel has the only Biblical film since THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST to treat Jesus and his disciplies seriously, but at the same time, make the enviroment the inhabit and the people throughout Judea dusty, messy, foul-smelling, etc.The controversy over the film's alleged Anti-Semitism has been raised only by the most politically-correct censors in the world. Anyone coming into the film will find much more fault with the Romans than with the Jews.That having been said, Gibson's drunk driving arrest, where he made his infamous ""jews-responsible-all-wars"" remark does leave a pretty sour aftertaste. Is Gibson Anti-Semitic? Sure sounnds like it to me. Is THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST itself anti-semitic? I don't think, and it isn't really fair to boycoot the film based on that, given that Jim Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern, and all the cast have never hinted at any anti-semitism. My advice is to just try to seperate the film from the man who made it.If you don't know the story of Jesus, I would suggest you either read up on it or avoid THE PASSION entirely.For everyone else, it is an extraordinary work of religious art.Although, I would reccomend you not eat anything before seeing it."	5.0	The King of Kings	2005-01-12	16	10	6

Today, it stands poised to out-gross TITANIC.  Gibon's ""Mel Against the World"" attitude was a brilliant marketing ploy that paid off well for Gibson.This review comes not from a left wing atheist; I am a proud Christian.  With all the controversy surrounding this film, I expected to feel something, after seeing it. I expected to feel appreciation, pain, disgust, or outrage, or to maybe even be offended.What happened was beyond my wildest imagination;  I left the theater thinking ""Was that any good?""  After a while it hit me; after this film was over, I felt NOTHING.  Now I'm not the most callous person in the world; I cried at the end of MIRACLE when the US beat the Soviet hockey team.  I even got misty eyed during THE RETURN OF THE KING.The violence in this film is way over the top, and just not realistic.  A man could not  stay conscious after loosing so much blood and being beaten with a cat of nine tails to the point where his ribs are exposed. Some would say ""He's the son of man- he could do anything.""  Yes he could- if he chose to.  But God created him to respond to pain as a human would respond.  That means he would have passed out after about ten or so lashes.  Therefore, those whipping scenes have less to do with reality than some sick fetish of Mel Gibson.Many people say that after awhile, you become ""numb"" to the violence in this film.  For me, it was actually worse than that; it became downright boring.  As with everything in this film, its drastically overdone, to the point of having no effect at all.As much as I hate to admit it, the film's most engaging character is Satan.  Maybe because he's the ONLY character who isn't screaming, crying, and/ or yelling and waving his fists in the air. His silent gaze has more potency than any hissing screaming or nashing of teeth.James Caviezal's performance as Jesus is another example of the film's over-reaching nature.  In every frame of the film, he is so obviously ACTING, that we don't see Christ- we see Caviezal breaking his back trying to get an Oscar nod.  Even the bullying musical score seems to scream a subliminal message; THIS IS THE BE ALL- END ALL- OF MOVIES- DO NOT FORGET IT!The really bizarre thing is that the film remains true to the gospels, but still manages to be pure Hollywood in a way I can't fully explain.  In short, I left the theatre feeling NOTHING,  after seeing a man beaten, tortured, and crucified, and that's a troubling concept."	1.0	A Strangely Empty Experience	2004-03-11	17	7	10

How can you expect the Movie titiled ""The Passion"" be about Christ's life. It can't! If you would like to see a movie about Chrits life and teach, thats good, go look for one at the video store or rental. This movie did a good if not superb job. It should to poeple what Christ really sufferd, to what extent. The metaphor's whe brilliant.It helps us see, with our physical eyes, but more inportantly, it gives us a look into the spirtual reality which is the root and true purpose of the film. What have we done, did we give of our selv's, even a little? There are a few problems, yes, but they are historical. Yes, there is the confusion of that Mary Magdelene was a harlot, we from all synoptic gospels and the supplimantery of John's that she was not. Also the sign over Christ's cross, they left out the Greek inscription. And that they nailed Jesus with 3 not 4 nails. Also Veronica.One quite humorus error is that Pilate spoke only Latin, but in the movie he spoke better Aramaic then every body else.Aside from all this, this movie was ecellent, and I recomend it to all, faithful and unbelivers.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A71P6MO4SXUW4	"music dude ""music dude"""	I saw this movie when it opened in theaters and I have recently seen it again with the purchase of the DVD. Firstly I think you should realize that I am 17 years old. I am at an age in which the majority has an extremely liberal viewpoint. I can proudly say that I am neither politcally nor religously liberal.  People my age, many friends that I know, think it to be the thing to do in order to rebel. I just have to say that the 50's are over. What do we possibly need to rebel against? Good morals and a good sense of religion? These liberals should get a life.Upon saying that I will get to my review of this movie. I can honestly say that this movie is one of the greatest acheivments I have ever seen in my life. I am saying that as a Christian teenager. Mel Gibson should be awarded with something for his incredible risk and gambit that he took to make this movie. Gibson has become my favorite actor over the past year due to the way he does not bend to the liberal Hollywood higher ups and the fact that hes not ashamed to be slightly conservative in a place where 90% of people are not. The movie is an absolute triumph. Never before have I seen such a tale of courage, pain, anger, hope, passion, and anguish. After seeing this movie one fully understands what it means to be Christian.  You fully understand what our Lord went through for us. FOR US. Not for his own personal glory but to save US. Gibson shows this through the use of extraordianry acting, vivd landscape, incredible cinamatography and a score that is nonstop and absolutely fanstastic. The movie is absolutely gorgeous and if you read the Bible you will realize that it is just as good a depiction of the passion of Christ as anything ever before.This brings me to my next point. The Anti-Semetic ordeal that this movie went through. Yet another libearl bunch of crap. Im sick and tired of this Michael Moore type of Hollywood where everything, even the most passionate and hopeful story ever told, is put down. It is funny that Michael Moore's bundle of lies, Faranheit 9/11, gained better national reviews than The Passion. It is interesting to think that at the Academy Awards, Moore will probobly be nominated for best director when Gibson probobly will not be. But hey thats my own personal opinion. We conservatives are always wrong. I always keep forgetting that. Anyway back to the Anti-Semetic bull. This is most absurd, repulsive lie ever. This movie in no way is Anti-Semetic. Not in any way at all. All this movie is is truth. I think we have to get over this politically correct nonsense. Oh we dont want to offend the jews. Well maybe we should face the fact that YES the jews did hand Christ over to the Romans. YES the High Priests were scared that Christ would control the crowd. And if anything, its the Romans who look bad in this movie. They come off as absolute monsters. Just demonic, evil men who care about no one but themselves. Im so aggravated with the politically correct, liberal, democratic, ivy league BS this country is in right now. It makes me sick that I am in a huge minority when it comes to people my age and my beleifs. This movie represetns everything i stand for. It represents everything that good moral people stand for. It is a timeless masterpiece that will go down in history. And i very highly doubt that this movie will win any major awards because of the liberal leanings of the academy.

This is anti-education because it is an artist's point of view and is neither correct nor does it have a justifiable impact, whether positive or negative.Even worse than incorrect history we are bombarded with ""stars"" using their power in areas which are not their expertise. Examples are Charlton Heston, Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave posing as experts in politics or ethics. What makes Mel Gibson a religious teacher?More than accuracy is the perception of the public.  Here is the danger. Words DO hurt.  Passion plays HAVE resulted in murder. Ignorant, thoughtless, haters who seek scapegoats for other things over which they have no control use Passion Plays to do just that.Antisemetic comments and events had become politically incorrect, but now are again acceptable. I thought Jews were accepted and admired in America. Yet, like many other Jews I'm wary about the perception of the public regarding this movie and the activity which may result from it. We'll have to wait and see.The depiction of Pilate fearing the Temple priests is totally inaccurate; he was powerful and ruthless.Gibson stirs emotions with raw realism. This probably was meant to lead to  the understanding of the core of Christianity. But it can ""give permission"" for ugly displays and dangerous activity to a vicious and ignorant few."	1.0	Danger when stars become historians , religious leaders...	2004-02-25	36	14	22

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2JJDM12OF39JK	MW	"The most disturbing thing about ""Passion of the Christ"" is not the copious bloody violence, but the boldly inane criticisms that it is ""sado-masochostic,"" ""anti-Semitic,"" or ""homophobic"" (?)  (I prefer not to go too far with that last one since it is so ridiculous as to be flat-out silly).  I suppose one could also argue that this film is unfair to Asian-Americans, since not a single one was cast in any role.There are two or three forgivable instances of Hollywood production intruding on GREAT art: one in which a womanly Satan screams up hysterically to the heavens from the cracked clay earth (this, at the moment of Jesus' death; I also thought the presence of Satan, at all, was an unnecessary, yet minor distraction); another was-- believe it or not-- Christ's perfectly manicured beard and mustache.Take those away and you have a stunning film with unbelievable power, movement, acting, and cinematography.There are those who will see it as overly violent, perhaps at the expense of Jesus' life-long messages of love and forgiveness.  This is a valid criticism. Please consider, though, this is not the entire story of His life; it is the intensely focused story of Christ's persecution and death as a Catholic director has interpreted such events through the Stations of the Cross.A must see.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AE2UB5FXJZX8D	mysterio	"I am not a Christian, but I used to be one, and I still attend church services with my family.  So with my history, I find it disturbing how seriously Christians have taken this movie.  ""The Passion"" has been shown more reverence than a Billy Graham Crusade.  The way I see it, this is evidence of religion being contaminated by the shallow dimensions of popular culture and by capitalistic stratagems.  A movie could reasonably deserve such  respect from the religious community if the movie contained an intelligent, illuminating, and thought-provoking message, but ""The Passion"" offers no such thing; just the visceral implications of seeing Jesus Christ get beat up.It scares me that so many people who have seen the movie give it such high critical praises.  There has probably never before been a point in the history of American cinema where a movie has gotten such accolades and has so little deserved them.  ""The Passion"" is a crappy movie, plain and simple.  If the main character were just an ordinary Joe, this movie would have been a complete failure.  The storyline is only substantial enough to lead the film from one torture/humiliation scene to the next.  The dialogue is perfunctory at best; it exists merely to keep this movie from being an old-fashioned silent film.  The characters are vague and uninteresting.  In particular, the Roman soldiers who abuse Jesus are cartoonishly brutish in appearance and demeanor.  In regards to all the characters who are only passingly mentioned in the Gospels, it seems that Mel Gibson makes no effort to bestow these individuals with any personality.  In regards to the violence in this movie, I am myself somewhat of a gore-fanatic, so I can't really complain much in that respect.  However, this hefty of a violence element, when combined with a puny plot, dialogue, and characterization, seems to create an exceptionally bleak and grim result.  I usually enjoy movie violence, but in this movie, the violence just isn't any fun.  Furthermore, I don't understand why anyone would want to purchase the DVD for this movie.  It was bad enough that I had to sit in a movie theatre and listen to audience members shrieking and crying, but why on earth would I want to watch this disturbing stuff in the comfort of my own home?  Only sadists have a good reason to buy this video.As a movie, ""The Passion"" is crap.  However, I can think of another, more positive, way of looking at this movie that salvages the perception of its quality.  ""The Passion"" is better viewed as a long montage of Christ's darkest hour, or a hybrid of cinema and visual art.  One thing that is obvious about ""The Passion"" is that the film is far more concerned with visuals and imagery than anything else.  I suppose, depending on how you look at it, this movie presents you with either silly and profuse melodrama or poignant visual poetry."	1.0	As a movie, this is a piece of crap	2005-05-16	25	11	14

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AB1OA9RKZZD62	Namyriah	"I'm posting this review due to encountering - often - criticisms of The Passion that occur in books published 8 years after its release.  Most of these are, oddly, Christian books, which accuse the movie of being ""too violent"" and making God look ""sadistic.""  Those accusations from unbelievers are understandable, but coming from Christians, they are bizarre.First of all, this is the first movie - ever - to show crucifixion in all its nastiness.  If you read the Gospels, you know they don't provide details: simply ""They crucified him."" The Gospels' original readers would've known just how horrible it was to die on a cross, suffering unfathomable pain before finally expiring.  Movies like The Greatest Story Ever Told or King of Kings are good, in their way, but frankly we don't see any real pain - more like Jesus feeling a pebble in his sandals.  Lots of paintings from the Middle Ages and Renaissance do capture some of what Jesus actually endured, but Gibson in fact did the world a great service by showing just how gory it was.  By the way, some reviewers - both Christian and not - condemned Passion's violence but (inconsistently) praised the ""realistic"" violence of movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.  Quentin Tarantino gets praised as an ""artist"" when he uses graphic violence, but Gibson, who made it clear he had a motive other than profit, got raked over the coal's for making a too-violent movie.I should mention here that, to my chagrin, lots of very devout Christians I know have avoided seeing this, and the usual excuse is ""I heard it's too violent.""  With all respect, that is the point: I can guarantee that seeing this movie will forever affect how you read the Bible and how hymns that refer to ""the cross"" take on a richer meaning.  There is a surplus of feel-good religion around, and Gibson's movie is a necessary counter-weight to all the fluff.  As I scroll through some Amazon reviews by people who say they are Christians but found the movie too violent, I'm wondering if the really saw it.  Everyone I know, personally, who saw it had a very different reaction - not ""Ooh, that was SO violent!"" but ""Now I understand what Jesus went through!""  And for the people who said they liked the movie but said ""Not for kids!"" I respectfully disagree.  Kids, judging from their movies and video games, have a pretty high tolerance for violence, probably more than we adults do.  I think Christians would do their kids a disservice by keeping them away from this movie, which shows what REAL violence is like - not cartoon fun, but thoroughly nasty.  I think any kid who has seen this movie might feel a bit of emotion the next time he sings ""Jesus Love Me.""I own the DVD of this movie and watch it every few months.  My TV can't quite duplicate the experience of first seeing it in a theatre in 2004.  I remember, about three minutes into the film, thinking ""He's filmed this like a horror movie - and for once the horror isn't an alien, vampire, werewolf, or serial killer - the horror is human evil, destroying a totally innocent man in brutal fashion. It's the one horror movie every Christian ought to see.""  People are so accustomed to crosses as wall decorations or as jewelry that they forget there was nothing visually appealing about a real cross.Jim Caviezel, who played Jesus, was probably the best screen Jesus ever.  Granted, in some scenes the make-up seems to be more prominent than the man under it, but considering what Jesus endured, the make-up was hardly ""over the top.""  Based on my reading of the Gospels, I think Pilate in the movie is a bit too warm-hearted - but perhaps that was the point.  If Pilate was shown as a thoroughly nasty character, his condemnation of Jesus would have seemed in keeping with his personality.  But the movie depicts him in a good light, as a fair-minded sort - and so it seems all the more horrible when he caves in to the mob and orders Jesus crucified.  The fellow playing Judas was superb - just the right guilty look, and, in the end, torn to pieces by what he has done.  The priests are shown as bad characters - which they were - and yet Gibson allowed them to show just a sliver of emotion when they see Jesus on the cross, as if they're not absolutely certain they've done the right thing.  They are not cardboard villains but, rather, human beings who have committed an atrocity.  My favorite character, aside from Jesus, was Simon of Cyrene, the bystander who gets forced into carrying Jesus' cross and, as they progress toward Golgotha, finding himself more and more sympathetic with this bleeding, mangled victim of injustice.Using subtitles was a great idea. I've always thought that actors' accents create a problem in biblical movies - The Last Temptation of Christ being the textbook case.  Having heard these characters speaking the actual languages of biblical times could have alienated audiences, but in fact did not.  I think it added to the feel of this being a documentary.  Wisely, the credits run at the end of the movie, not the beginning.  Gibson knew how to set the mood.Regarding the end: I don't think it could have been done better.  As a Christian (one whose life has been, to put it mildly, a cesspool since this movie was released), Gibson had to follow the crucifixion with the resurrection.  But he shows us as little as possible - all to the good, since the Gospels tell us very little about how it actually occurred.  Having sat through the horror  - I recall a lot of sniffing in the theatre - the payoff, as in the Gospels, is that God raises up Jesus to new life.  We see the risen Jesus just a few seconds, but it's enough - the ""happy ending"" that is part of the gospel.In regard to the accusation of ""anti-Semitism"":  that charge has been thrown at every Jesus movie since Cecil B. DeMille made King of Kings back in 1927.  Frankly, I just don't see how anyone can believe that showing a group of Jewish priests in 1st-century Palestine as villains is going to make people today rush out and do nasty things to Jews.  And I'm sure anyone who has seen the movie knows, the most brutal of the characters are the Romans.In short, if you haven't seen this, do - especially if you consider yourself a Christian but were put off by the ""Too violent!"" mantra.  Yeah, it's violent - like real crucifixions.  If you really believe ""Christ died for me,"" take a cold hard look at just what that meant."	5.0	Yeah, It's Violent - Like a Real Crucifixion - Duh!	2012-09-08	6	4	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1K4AVQIU704DY	"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan"""	I was put off by The Passion because of not knowing who most of the people were. I could suppose which character was Pontius Pilot, but could only guess who was King Herod. I could figure out which character was Jesus' mother Mary, and which was Mary Magdalene, but not if Joseph was even in the movie. The movie began right before Judas betrayed Jesus so it passed by a lot of material covered at the beginning of Jesus Christ Superstar. The movie ended right after Jesus' death while I had wished it would continue to His resurrection. However much Gibson had shown of what was physically done to Jesus, other than how he showed the depth of love both Mary's showed for Him, it left too many holes for me. I expected the violence, having read many reviews prior to finally seeing the movie for the first time Sunday, March 21, a week before Palm Sunday. I won't go into a rundown of the plot since that has been done innumerable times, but if the movie showed Judas' suicide, I must not have been looking at he screen. I did enjoy the glimpses of Jesus' ministry work where we could see what he looked like before the Roman soldiers began having their fun. I also enjoyed the scenes with His mother and how much she loved him while a young boy, and now as a grown man put to unbelievable torture. I wondered if the soldiers' intent was to scourge him to death until an officer stepped in to stop them. I was pleased I could be mesmerized by Gibson's film without missing the songs that made up Jesus Christ Superstar. I also enjoyed hearing another language spoken though I had forgotten it was Armenian until I reread a review that reminded me of that. Despite the daring viewpoint of how much savagery was displayed by the punishers, little was made of how much He suffered during the crucifixion itself, though certainly the long walk, the driving in of the nails in His plams, and especially for me the attaching of His legs to the post were thoroughly co vered. When Jesus gave up His spirit to God, the storm that ensued well described God's way of communicating the great importance of what had taken place -- that His only-begotton Son had died for man's sins. Even so, I will still favor the more-watered down versions of this epoch.	3.0	I Was Left Wondering Who Was Whom	2010-03-22	3	1	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3HOF1OBYCV0I5	Nate Volkerding	"I would like to write a little about this movie's critics: The typical newspaper or magazine column about The Passion has excoriated the movie, branding it a bloody, anti-semetic, sado-masochistic mess- they also usually manage to work in the word, ""pornographic"". The movie is said to fail in not focusing on Jesus's life and his great moral teachings -the things that everyone can find agreement with. Mr Gibson is personally attacked as a religous wacko from the dark ages - that is, he literally believes the Christ myth, rather than taking the enlightened view that it is all a metaphor for the changing of the seasons- dark aspersions are cast upon him for his refusal to publicly rebuke his 85 year old father. In short, the typical review has taken a stern, one might almost say, puritanical, stance against violence in the cinema, and has attempted to instruct the Christians in the doctrines of Christianity while simultaneously (unconsciously or otherwise) rejecting them.I think it would be unfortunate if this movie were to become some sort of acid test for Christian belief. Undoubtedly, there are critics, who, for matters of personal taste or some other reason, will simply find this film unnappealing. These I think, though, are the relativly small minority. I believe that the rest of the film's negative critacism can be divided into two groups; those who openly and knowingly contest Christianity (a surprisingly small portion of this film's negative reviews come from those who plainly admit this), and those who simply have a quite egregiously poor understanding of what it means to be a Christian.With respect to the second group, they generally take the position that Christ was, first and foremost, a great moral teacher, and that Mr. Gibson has seriously erred in not concentrating on this aspect of his life. This position is a half truth, at best, I believe. There have been many great moral teachers, and, to a surprising degree, they have taught the same thing. Whether it was Plato or Confucius, we would doubtlessly all of us be much the better if we followed their teachings. We can't -at least none of us can very well or very consistently- that is the whole point. Chrisitianity is the most pragmatic of religions, it is the only one that knows man will fail. Even the very best among us make atrocious mistakes; we all wrong ourselves, each other and God in and to a quantity and degree that is simply unforgivable. If this were not so then the passion would have been unnecessary. Without the passion, Christianity is meaningless.To look at the ""moral teacher"" assertion from another angle, it is merely wrong. Most people, even non-Christians, accept that the words of Jesus are those of a great moralist. But what other great moralist claims to be mankind's saviour? To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, this leaves us with few options. We can accept that Jesus is who he claims to be, or else we must come to the conclusion that he is a raving lunatic, or, indeed, something much worse than that.There is, behind all this, this desire to have Christ without the cross, an unwillingness and a distinct discomfort towards accepting human nature for what it has become. After all, at some times, on some levels, I've probably convinced myself that I was basically a decent guy. Most of us really are more good than we are bad, aren't we? No, actually, we aren't -a history book, or even an honest self examination ought to make that readily and abundantly clear. Every earthly, utopian scheme mankind has cooked up or ever will,  breaks on his own nature. The modern person has no difficulty with Christ as a hippy, who sings Broadway songs about love and peace. The Christ who died an excruciating death so that our sins might be cleaned -the idea that this modern person might have any sins that cannot be cleansed with an honest apology or a card and flowers. Or, to go even farther, the idea that sin is anything more than an antiquated human invention(!) - seems to have a puzzling, rather infuriating effect on our hypothetical modern person.This review is getting quite long, but I'd like to write a couple more personal thoughts on the movie before I finish.I should maybe say, as regards myself, that I was raised a very nominal Lutheran. I was for a long while an agnostic with a rather low opinion of Christians. It was only after reading  Plato's Socratic dialougues that I was able conceive an understanding of God that made any sense to me, and it's only been even more recently yet that I've come to reconcile that understanding with Christianity. In short, I must admit, it is a rather airy, conceptualized faith that I hold to.There is one image from this film that remains in my mind days after viewing. Christ stands mutilated, wearing the crown of thorns, looking out into the leering crowd. Here the expression is simultaneously of mute defiance and acceptance; he stands as the living truth, in defiance of man, what man has become and what man will yet do, and in acceptance of what He must do. Mr. Gibson's film was, to me, the first clear, visceral view of something I believe I've felt and understood in only a fleeting way. With regards to this, to again paraphrase Mr. Lewis, I cannot help but feel that there is such a thing as getting more than you bargained for.This is a relentless, brutal film, and that is maybe the one thing which everyone who sees it will agree on. Mr. Gibson has shown no mercy to his audience; he ignores their culture, the age they live in, their sensibilities, even their language in attempting to present the truth. By making a movie that is superficially alien and unspecific to any group of people, he has made a film that is equally universal to all. Wheras church leaders today stress the importance of making the faith accessible, Mr. Gibson is clearly more concerned with persuading people to make themselves accesible to the timeless and unchanging truth. I walked away from the film convinced that this was it's end and final artistic goal, and God bless you for it, Mr. Gibson."	5.0	No milk and water for Mr. Gibson	2004-03-23	8	7	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1MZ5QA4MQBXS8	"Nathanael Newell ""Nathan"""	"Passion of the Christ features some fantastic visuals all throughout the movie.  The crucifixion scenes are often highlighted and I think they're done particularly well, as the audience emotes exactly as the director intended, with repulsion for the brutal acts and pity for Jesus and his followers.  But this is not the only instance of amazing visuals.  I would also cite Satan's temptation of Jesus as another perfect example, as well as many others.The acting is awkward.  Since the actors only speak Aramaic, it's apparent that none of the actors understand the language and cannot express themselves particularly well.  For this same reason, the dialogue is somewhat simplistic.  But the Aramaic does tend to make the movie seem more authentic, and I applaud the concept.However, I feel this is a bad DVD purchase.  While the movie is rendered well, the DVD contains NO special features.  This is the only DVD in my collection that has no additional features.  Even the $6-bin movies and the cereal box premiums have something extra.  It seems like Mel Gibson wanted to release a sub-standard DVD early so that the overly-anxious people (myself included) would snatch it up, and then release a ""Special Edition"" version later so that those who are really interested in the movie (again, myself included) would buy it again.  Although the early bird often gets burned with DVD purchases, usually the first DVD makes itself worthwhile with some interesting extras.  This DVD does not.Passion gets three stars given it's a wonderful movie experience.  But for those who have not bought it yet, I would recommend waiting for the inevitable Passion Special Edition."	3.0	Great movie but... no special features?!	2004-09-07	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AH42DLNUT3D9L	Nathan Hicks	I had the opportunity to privately screen this movie in November in its unfinished condition.  All I can say is that This movie has had more of an impact on me than any other movie ever.  The film is extremely accurate in its history.  It has incredible acting and it will stun you sitting there watching it.  The film does has english subtitles because it is actually filmed in aramaic.  But the imagery of the film definitely transcends the subtitles, even to the point where it makes sense not to have the movie in the english language.  Some scenes are graphic, but not overly detailed.  It will make you squirm in your seat quiet a few times while watching it. I can think of 5 times during this film where I could not hold back tears.....and i never cry during a movie.Overall this movie probably will not get the acclaim it deserves just because of its subject matter.  But it is the best movie so far in the 21st Century.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone...no matter if your a religious person or not...Gibson does a incredible job of taking a 2000 year old story and turning it into a reality before your eyes	5.0	Incredible Masterpiece	2004-01-03	981	769	212
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AZCNMRY1NEIOU	Nathaniel Campbell	"Let me first offer my reactions to the film itself.  I could write a lengthy response to all of the controversary concerning the film's violence, possible anti-semitism, and possible reinterpretation of the story, but I will instead focus on the positive.  As a college student who studies, among other things, theology and philosophy, I attended this film with the intention to view it with a critical eye, as I knew that it was from a critical standpoint that I would be required to discuss it.  This I was able to do through the beating before the Sanhedron, the whipping at the post, the crown of thorns, and the beginning of the Way of the Cross.  However, my emotions (as a devout Catholic) overcame me at the First Fall when Mary, having a flashback to Jesus stumbling as a child, runs to comfort Him.  For just a moment, the story ceases to be about the Saviour and the Saved, and it is about a Mother and her Son.  It was this moment, when I thought about my own mother, that my eyes finally filled with tears.  The performance of Jim Caviesal has been much celebrated; in my opionion, however, the best performance of the film belongs to Maia Morgenstern.  She played Mary as a mother dealing with the death of her son - for her, the Divinity of Christ did not matter, she cared only for His humanity.  Her performance was worthy of five stars and more, and it is a pity that, because of the controversy of the film, she may not be nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Award; all things being equal, she would win it hands down.  On her performance alone, this movie deserves 5 stars.However, I have given it only 3 stars because I am reviewing the DVD release as well.  The complete and total lack of Special Features, be it ""The Making of...,"" the Primetime interview, Commentaries, etc., is very disappointing.  I'm very surprised that Mel Gibson did not take the opportunity to expand on the spiritual impact of the film (and perhaps to redeem himself of criticism) by offering extensive documentaries on The Passion, or a Director's Commentary to trace his own spiritual journey in the film.  I do hope that he will at some point soon offer a DVD with such features."	3.0	Film was Moving, DVD Lackluster	2004-09-08	3	2	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1X8RKC3USTZNT	"Nathan P. Graf ""npg2"""	This is a film that will stand up to the test of time like all of the biblical greats such as 'The Ten Commandments'. In twenty years I guarantee you that this film will be remembered as a golden classic. And I rarely say that about a film. POTC is special, different, and it draws on the pathos within us all.Keep in mind that this film is not for everyone. This is only an interpretation, in this case by Mr. Gibson of what Jesus' final hours of life were like. Anyone who instantly denounces this film for it's context has a narrow mind. Like any film, the channels of awareness should be made available to us as the audience, not limited to just the message that the film is trying to make.Finally I commend Mel Gibson for attempting such a daring and controversial feat to recapture the life of the most important human figure in Western history- Jesus Christ. Everything from the costumes, the score, the language (in sub titles), and the acting were impeccably done. Mel Gibson is a one of the faithful and a believer. Kuddos to you Mel!For all of you that complain and whine about the grotesque and excessive violence in this film, then simply do not watch it. No one is making you or punishing you by watching The Messiah being whipped and beaten to utter death. Walk away!The theme that I have recieved from watching this film is not one of anger, hate, or vengeance, but one of indebted thanks and love for the holy sacrifices that Jesus gave up for all of humanity over 2,000 years ago.Film is unquestionably art.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ANQ5BYQUIT52Z	"Nathan Zoebl ""boxman782"""	"The Passion of the Christ is a retelling of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life (perhaps you've heard of him?). In these final hours we witness his betrayal at the hands of Judas, his trial by Jewish leaders, his sentencing by Pontius Pilate, his subsequent whippings and torture and finally his crucifixion. Throughout the film Jesus is tempted by Satan, who is pictured as a pasty figure in a black hood (kind of resembling Jeremy Irons from The Time Machine if anyone can remember). The Passion spares no expense to stage the most authentic portrayal of what Jesus of Nazareth endured in his final 12 hours of life.For all the hullabaloo about being the most controversial film in years (and forgive me for even using the term ""hullabaloo""), I can't help but feel a smidgen of disappointment about the final product. The Passion is aptly passionate and full of striking images, beautiful photography and production values and stirring performances all set to a rousing score. But what makes The Passion disappointing to me is the characters. You see, Mel Gibson's epic does not devote any time to fleshing out the central characters. They are merely ciphers and the audience is expected to plug their feelings and opinions into these walking, bleeding symbols to give them life. Now, you could argue this is what religion is all about, but as far as a movie's story goes it is weak. The Passion turns into a well-meaning and slick spectacle where character is not an issue. And as a spectacle The Passion is first-rate; the production is amazing and the violence is graphic and gasp-inducing. Do I think the majority of people will leave the theater moved and satisfied? Yes I do. But I can't stop this nagging concern that The Passion was devoid of character and tried covering it up with enough violence to possibly twist its message into a Sunday school snuff film.For my money, the best Biblical film is Martin Scorsese's 1987 The Last Temptation of Christ (also a film mired in controversy). Last Temptation, unlike Gibson's spectacle, was all about Jesus as a character and not simply as a physical martyr. Scorsese's film dealt with a Christ consumed by doubt and fear and the frailties of being human. But the best part is the final 20 minutes when Jesus is tempted, by Satan, to step down from the cross and live out a normal life. Jesus walks away from the cross, marries Mary Magdalene, fathers children (this is where the controversy stemmed from but they were married) and dies at an old age. Jesus is then confronted by his aging apostles who chastise him for not living up to what he was supposed to do to save mankind. Jesus wakes up from the illusion and fulfills his mission and dies on the cross. Now, with the story of Last Temptation an audience has a greater appreciation for the sacrifice of Jesus because they witness his fears and they witness the normal life he forgoes to die for man's sins. There is a sense of gravity about what Jesus is sacrificing.With The Passion Gibson figures if he can build a sense of grand sacrifice by gruesomely portraying the tortures Jesus endured. Even if it is Jesus, and this may sound blasphemous, torturing a character to create sympathy and likeability is the weakest writing trick you can do. Yes Jesus suffered a lot, yes we should all be horrified and grateful, and yes people will likely be moved at the unrelenting violence he endured, but in regards to telling a story, I cannot feel as much for characters whose only characterization is their suffering. Sure, The Passion flashes back to some happier moments of Jesus' life, which I like to call the Jesus Greatest Hits collection, but the movie does not show us who Jesus was, what he felt (beyond agonizing pain) or the turmoil he went through in finally deciding to give up his own life for people that despised him. The Passion is not about character but about spectacle.The actors all do a fine job and it's impressive that everyone's lines is in two dead languages (Latin and Aramaic, though for the life of me I can't tell them apart). But the acting is limited because of the nature of the film. Had there been more moments of character the acting would come across better. As it stands, the acting in The Passion is relegated to looks of aguish or looks of horror, interspersed with weeping. Monica Bellucci (The Matrix sequels) really has nothing to do as Mary Magdalene but run around in the background a lot. Jim Caviezel (Frequency, Angel Eyes) gives everything he has in the mighty big shoes he tries to fill. It's too bad that his Jesus spends most of the screen time being beaten, which kind of hampers his acting range.Now let's address the anti-Semitic concerns. Let's face facts; you are not going to have a film about the crucifixion of Jesus and some Jews coming off in a good light. Just as you would not have a film about the Holocaust and have some Germans coming off in a good light. It is unavoidable. The Passion does portray a handful of Jewish religious leaders as instigators for Jesus' eventual crucifixion, but there are also Jewish leaders who denounce their actions and just as many people bemoaning the torture of Jesus as there are calling for it. Who really comes off looking bad are the Romans. Excluding the efforts to make Pilate look apprehensive, the Romans soldiers are always seen kicking, punching, whipping, spitting on Jesus and laughing manically with their yellow teeth. How anyone could watch The Passion and come away anti-Semitic and not anti-Italian is beyond me. The anti-Semitic controversy will die down as soon as people actually see the film.And like I said before, most people will be extremely satisfied with the film because it's hard to find a person who doesn't have an opinion on Jesus. Gibson is counting on audiences to walk in and fill in the holes of the character so that The Passion is more affecting. But Gibson's film is worthy spectacle, and despite the vacuum of character I did get choked up four separate times, mostly involving Jesus and his mother. The Passion is a well-made and well-intentioned film that will hit the right notes for many. I just wish there were more to it than spectacle. I really do."	3.0	More Spectacle than Character, but Good Spectacle	2004-02-23	107	45	62

Jim Caviezel's acting was superb and Mel Gibson did a wonderful job directing this film. I cried so much during this movie.I will warn everyone right now: this movie is not suitable for ALL members of the family. If you're going to watch this with your children, word of advice: it is EXTREMELY violent. I can't even begin to describe how violent it is. Furthermore, there are some scenes that are just SO scary, that for this reason also, I would advise people to not show this to children under the age of 13, and even then, you should be extremely cautious.Nonetheless, this movie is absolutely exceptional and if you're looking to watch a movie that depicts Jesus's passion, this movie will satisfy!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1M0EQWAYGVNVR	Neburo	"I have mixed views of this movie. Let me explain.* It's extremely violent -- It's very disturbing how many times Jesus is hit in the court yard.* Mel Gibson is extremely good at directing films. The cinematography is excellent. The way the Jewish Sanhedrin is dressed, the way Caiaphas shouts. The fact it's done in Aramaic and Latin all the way through adds to the realism.* The music fits the scenes very well.* I love the first bit where it's dark and they are outside -- beautiful scenery!*IT HAS SUBTITLES ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT! -- IF YOU DON'T LIKE SUBTITLES, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM. But it's a shame, because it makes it so much more realistic!Jesus (they say Yeshua 'Mesheeiah' in the film) has flash backs throughout the film. On the mountain telling everybody to have love amongst themselves, the Passover, the woman caught in adultery (disputed part of the Bible) and playing around with the woman at the well.Despite it's inaccuracies towards history, the basic settings, feelings and attitudes betrayed through this movie is very accurate and it's like as if you are witnessing Jesus' last few hours before his painful and agonizing crucifixion.All Christians when just finishing watching this film would feel happy they are Christians. Any Christian, or Christian sect: Catholic, Anglican, Born Again, Greek Orthodox, 7th Day, Mormon or a Jehovah's Witness would love this film -- even though they would not admit what religious organization they'd come from!I love the way center on the role of Jesus as the Christ and his absolute love of God which he consistently calls ""father"" all throughout the film. Jesus is shown in the film as loving, kind, compassionate but also having a human side to his nature to him, which is exactly how he is betrayed in the Gospels, which is opposite to the movie ""The Ten Commandments"" mini-series (not to be mistaken for the 1950's classic by the same name!) which shows Moses from a human perspective far too much. The Passion was quite disturbing, but morally up building which is opposite to the 10 commandments miniseries -- I wasn't convinced by the acting, or the sets...The people in The Passion look Jewish, act Jewish and speak ancient languages. I could have imagined Pontius Pilate to be like that -- a typical European stature, bald head and with good reasoning ability.Strangely enough, I have a new way at looking at Judas -- the way he threw the money at Caiaphas showed how upset he was, and who knows if he will be resurrected. The whole experience was an extremely turbulent time. I felt sad for Peter who denied Jesus 3 times...WARNING: SPOILER!!! I don't often give away spoilers, but because this is a religious movie title, I thought I'd give my opinion on the fact the tail end of the movie was a bit short, and should have shown the ""doubting Thomas"" not believing that it really was Jesus unless he sees the print of the nails.I heard some weird rumor about the fact the divine name is used, which is complete nonsense. It would have been good if they did say ""Yahweh/Jehovah,"" or even Iabe... but it doesn't really matter because I realize it was done by a Catholic. Maybe they said YHWH, but probably missed it because I did watch the movie very late at night. But all for the better!I almost would want to go to church after seeing this movie and be Catholic myself! The connection between the Roman rule of Jerusalem and approximately 300 years when the Catholic faith historically started, the Christian religion would later become the state religion of the Roman empire. Thank God Constantine god rid of the crucifix when he became Christian!I don't know why Mel added the inaccuracies: like speaking Latin the the Jewish Sanhedrin crowds, the evil man on the cross having his eyes poked out by a bird, Satan as a woman (!) and so forth. But these weird ""apocryphal"" things don't spoil the passion for Jesus Christ.Great movie. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED: It's extremely violent and perhaps Jesus was beaten too much? Although, he was a perfect man, it would have taken a while to beat him nearly half to death as what happened to him in this movie. This movie was written by a man who has such a passion for Jesus, and is perhaps more symbolic in some places rather than historical and maybe he wanted to do this so we have more feelings for our king Jesus before he hands over his throne to the Father after the 1000 years. I hope Mel makes more films like this. How about a movie about The Acts of the Apostles, or A Revelation to John from the New Testament and use the book of Jude as an intro and having a flashback where Jesus is arguing with the devil over Moses' body. I am looking forward to his next film: Apocalypto, which is going to be released later 2006 about the Mayans before Columbus and their declining civilization. Great director! That movie has subtitles all the way through it too!"	3.0	An honorable 3 Stars!	2006-04-17	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AUH36NUNBVII8	"Negombo ""Lo"""	A few thoughts:1. Not a film for the kiddies.2. In the bible, it's no big secret that Jesus (a Jew) was p*****g off the Pharisees (founders of modern day Judaism) by calling them liars and hypocrites, and showing them that their silly laws were leaving them in the dark ages. Fact is, Jesus' teachings were contrary to Judaism's - consequently he was a threat to the status quo. Jews have shown dissent among themselves for years over Judaism - why do you think they have Orthodox, Conservative and Reform sects, some with female(!) Rabbis? A female trying to be a Rabbi back then would have been dragged from the temple and stoned to death.3. Too far ahead of his time with his crazy ideas (shown in his actions more than in his words) about womens' rights, the rights of children, and God's law over mans', he was just too much of a threat. Due to the fear of the people in power at that time, they had him snuffed out. No big surprise, all of it is in the bible - why is then a portrayal (an accurate one at that) of Jesus' execution and the events leading up to it considered so controversial? It's been in the bible for centuries.4. It's not a feel good film. I felt drained after watching this exceptionally long torture session. I wonder if in fact Jesus went through everything TO THE EXTENT the movie depicts. Most of us would have been dead before the cross was handed to us. However, I have no doubt of the accuracy of the torture and beating scenes. The Jews living on Masada committed suicide rather than be captured by the Romans. This movie might give one an idea why.5. I am glad I saw it. Most religious films show an overly sweet Jesus with shlock like glowing robes, which leaves us with the impression that Jesus was somehow other worldly. He was, but he was also human. In most of these movies, we have no idea how brutal an execution like a crucifixion was. Now we know. There are also no glow in the dark eyes, kitschy halos or Romans talking in Shakesperian accents in Passion, thank you Mel.6. I felt neither angry nor anti-Semetic (I was raised a Catholic but dropped out at age 9) after watching this. It depicts human folly and the killing of an innocent man during some rather turbulent times. I am also technically (according to Jewish law) Jewish on my mom's side, and I didn't feel at all paranoid. To my Jewish friends who do feel that way, remember, this is not the 1100's or the 1930's. People are brighter than that now, give it a rest, ok?7. Main complaints - it dragged, I didn't feel good afterwards - though I wasn't supposed to - higher on brutality than on philosophy. Still, it's a must see.	5.0	What was all the fuss about?	2005-12-21	18	10	8

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AMVGV3KEMW56S	"Neil Landis ""johannesilentio"""	Mel Gibson's Passion is a true masterpiece of modern cinema. Those who disregard it do so because they don't understand that the movie has much in it that the viewer should already know. The movie is meant more to be a meditation than an evangelical message.The discussions of historical accuracy forget that there are things not written in the Gospels. The Gospels were written for evangelism, not to capture every detail. Much of the details have been developed (or culturally remembered) through traditions of the early Church, that Church long before the Schism of 1000, and even longer before the Reformation of the 1500s.The bloodiness and violence are necessary. In a culture desensitized by violence (Saving Private Ryan, multiple slasher films), the cruelty, which only needed to be slightly enhanced -- not invented, was meant to shock the modern audience as part of this meditation.Much of the criticism is analogous to art critics critiquing a Byzantine icon. No perspective. What's with the big golden circle around his head? But to those who understand that it is a vehicle of meditation realize that there is a deeper truth portrayed by this seemingly savage painting.Not a movie for everyday viewing, but for the fortifying meditation of the devout heart.	5.0	The Greatest Love Story Ever Told	2007-09-14	3	1	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3SU3TXON36T0X	"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos"""	Mel Gibson's _The Passion_ is a fascinating depiction of the sufferings of Christ from his encounter in the Garden of Gethsemani until his death on the Cross and burial in the tomb.  The movie is nearly entirely in Aramaic (perhaps the original language of Christ) and Latin (for the Roman guards) with some subtitles.  The resurrection is not covered in the movie; however, we do see glimpses of the coming invents in a renewed (bodily) Christ and Satan being bound in Hades.  Mel Gibson is a traditionalist Roman Catholic who has attempted to restore a once well established tradition within the modern age, that of the Passion Play.  During the Middle Ages, the Passion was routinely acted out in churches across Europe, revealing the inner secrets of Christ through this profound drama.  Gibson bases his Passion on the Four Canonical Gospels (especially that of Matthew) and also on some of the visions of the Roman Catholic nun Venerable Catherine Anne Emmerich (who experienced visions which she recorded during a long illness, and supposedly lived for several years sustained upon the Holy Eucharist alone).  The scenes from the movie are indeed surreal and they reveal the inner torments and struggles between God, the Father and Satan within the minds of Jesus Christ, Son of God and his betrayer Judas Iscariot (who tormented by demons will eventually be driven to hang himself).  The movie features much from both the Bible and tradition and legend, including many references that are likely to be missed by those not familiar with both (for example, the serpent snapping at the heel of Christ who stamps upon its head, cf. Genesis).  The movie also has the air of mystery and like the early Greek mystery cults the Passion and the subsequent Stations of the Cross serve as a mystery of the living Faith of Christ revealed in his death and resurrection.  The Pharisees and high priests of the time are portrayed as truly wicked and serve a purpose only to mock and jeer at what they do not (indeed cannot) understand.  Many have accused Mel Gibson of antisemitism, merely because he would not bend to the political correct ideals of the day and remove the troublesome passages from the Gospel accounts.  Indeed, the world of First Century Palestine was very different from the world of today, but it is clear from both reading the Gospels and from seeing the movie based upon them who the real culprits are for the death of the Messiah.  I think Mr. Gibson does a particular service to the modern era by revealing these truths which were once known to many (during the Middle ages) but which since have become buried and made esoteric courtesy of post-Enlightenment modernism.  The movie is extremely gory, depicting sufferings on a level that may be incomprehensible to many.  In fact, at many points during the movie (particularly during the more touching moments in which Jesus and his mother Mary were seen together or the moments with Mary Magdelene as well) I felt myself tearing up (often somewhat uncontrollable).  The scourgings for example were particularly difficult to watch, and the actual act of nailing Christ to the Cross was very gruesome.  You may have to turn your head away, but if you can you should probably watch what you can make it through so as to make it fully beyond this step of initiation into the Passion Play.  The movie ends with Christ dead upon the Cross and being buried.  At the moment of Christ's death, the sky is said to have darkened up and the Earth to have quaked and fissures opened up, also the dead and many saints were said to have risen from their graves.  Some of this is depicted near the end of the movie.  The movie does not show the Ressurection (which is unfortunate) leaving us off with a somewhat depressing picture of things, until the Easter season comes and reveals for us the fullness of Christ resurrected bodily and the redemption of mankind.  The movie shows some interesting developments of the mass, including the work of Jesus Christ as a carpenter; however, it does not show an actual Roman mass - yet, it does preserve the exact words of Christ used to consecrate bread and wine during the transubstantiation.  I do wish that Mr. Gibson had shown more of the details from the Bible account, more flashbacks for example, and more from the tradition and subsequent legend, and less gore, perhaps.  However, I recognize that this would have been difficult to do given his constraints.  Upon the bodily death of Christ upon the Cross, the spear of the Roman centurion Longinus is used to spear the side of Christ releasing water and blood from his body.  A true miracle of God.  Also, the movie depicts the salvation of the good thief at the Cross and the raven picking at the eye of the other thief.  This movie represents a true return to the tradition of the Church and to the medieval Passion Play for modern day America.  Perhaps more who watch this movie will be inspired by it, and see in it the Christianity of their youth which they have since either rejected or fallen away from.  A true restoration of Christianity within America could indeed be a most glorious thing - and with the coming of the Easter season we shall once again witness renewed life.	5.0	The Passion of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.	2004-03-16	8	5	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ	Nicholas Carroll	"When I first heard that Mel Gibson was making a film of the passion story, and selected actor Jim Caviezel to play the role of Jesus, I thought this was a brilliant move.  Ever since I saw ""Pay it Forward"", I saw something of Christ in Caviezel and hoped he would actually get to play that role someday.  The other stroke of genius with ""The Passion of the Christ"" was using dialogue in the Aramaic and Latin languages, to lend a huge dose of realism to this film.  Finally, we get to hear the words of Christ and his disciples in the language they spoke!This film has great, Oscar-worthy performances by Caviezel, by the woman who played his mother, and by the actor who played Pontius Pilate, and I hope they receive that recognition come Oscar time.  The visuals in the film were excellent and the film moved along, growing in intensity with each scene.  Gibson is a masterful storyteller and visual artist, and I also hope he receives a nod for Best Director by the Academy.The downside of the film for me is the violence.  I do understand Gibson's intention was to show us the amount of suffering Christ endured for the sin of humanity and that it is our duty to endure the pain of watching such brutal violence he endured, but I thought it went on too long, with too much intensity.  The violence surpasses ""Saving Private Ryan"" and was almost too much for me to handle.  I was pleased that Gibson offered brief respites of the violence with flashbacks from key scenes in Jesus' life...the most tear inducing for me being the little boy who fell and was comforted by his mother.  My favorite scene in the whole movie was seeing Jesus laughing as he talked to his mother about a table he was making.  I wished there were more of that...in fact, I would almost beg Gibson to make this film the middle in a trilogy...with the same actors, one covering ""The Life of the Christ"" and the other covering ""The Resurrection of the Christ"".  In fact, the film is so brief in the resurrection scene, that I felt awful leaving the theater.  There was no uplifting final scene to carry with you when you left the theater.  I guess the point was to make us feel awful and guilty and hopefully get movie goers to head straight to church to confess their sins and renew their commitment to Jesus once again.Which brings me to my final point.  This film has been seen as the best evangelical missionary tool to come along in ages.  Many people seem to think that you could show a film like this to a non-Christian and they would be so guilt-ridden that they'd instantly convert to Christianity.  If only if it were that simple.  For me personally, a Christian all my life who leans towards Buddhism, I find the story of making Jesus out to be a sacrifice to appease an angry God to be simple, illogical, and insulting to anyone who believes in an all-knowing God.  Portraying Jesus as a mere sacrifice who endured suffering for the sake of humanity does have metaphorical implications, but such violence is more likely to turn off people who shun violence, like many Buddhists are.  But that's my only major complaint about the film.  It doesn't detract overall from the high quality standards of this film nor its importance.  It is worth owning on DVD and definitely will be my annual Good Friday tradition, so I can remind myself on that sorrowful day just what Jesus had to endure on his way towards divinity."	4.0	A passion for violence that's almost too intense	2004-10-15	5	3	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A8FGNAMRVXQSZ	Nicholas I. Keiser	"This film is melodramatic garbage, and I must wonder why more Christian folks weren't up in arms over the film. Apart from the beautiful languages spoken throughout the course of the film, there's very little in terms of merit here. I understand the point intended by displaying the slow physical death of Jesus is to make us feel compassion, but the flaying and beating go on for so long as to desensitize the viewer to the graphic violence. Instead of emotion or depth, we're treated to lots of make-up effects and gallons upon gallons of stage blood. Criticism that the only ""content"" of the film comes from the flashbacks is misguided -these scenes play out as a ""best-of-Jesus"" montage that do little more than alter the pace of the film. The intended point was probably to make up for the complete lack of character development or any sort of insight, but the actual function is that it breaks up long and (at least initially) unsettling scenes so that we don't grow bored as the inevitable approaches. All of the acting here is hollow, wooden fare save for the woman playing Mary. This is all further trivialized by the completely laughable stabs at frightening the viewers: demon children chasing down Judas, the withered ""devil baby"", and then, that most offensive sequence of all, the three-quarters-perspective pull back of Satan crying out ""NOOOOOOO!!!!"" from Hell, which is apparently some place comprised of badly rendered CGI by multimedia students at the corporate ""art"" school of your choice. As a non-Christian, I'm outraged that this film got positive reviews. I've discussed much of this with Christian friends of mine, and several opted to not see this film on my advice; the one who did phoned me after watching and agreed with me. If you believe in Jesus, or agree with some of the ideals presented in the New Testament, this film will raise hackles on your back. It's sensationalistic, Hollywood-style crap masquerading as a purportedly moving indie film. Avoid at all costs."	1.0	offends me, even as a non-Christian	2004-11-11	43	20	23

Mel Gibson really did a great job of showing what Jesus went through to save us. Sure, the film was extremely graphic and violent, but that's exactly how it happened: violently.When I say I loved the movie, I don't mean I loved it for how it was made or the stunning special effects... I mean that I love it because it gives us an idea of what really happened during those last 12 hours, and what our Saviour endured to take our sin away.I hope that everyone who sees this movie is somewhat changed, or at last goes away feeling something from God in their hearts.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2SA8YI0TCZSG1	Nick Nalepa	"Have you ever been in a real ER during a real situation?  Seems like a strange question to lead off with, but there is method to my madness here.  There are two types present in the ER during a crisis.  The ER docs and nurses are all professional detachment.  They must refuse to see people and see instead busted body parts needing triage and repair.  This is necessary to survive the drama of the auto accident/plane wreck/etc.  The other type is in for a longer night.  The family and friends of the ""busted parts"" come in terrified and in tears.  They see loved ones horribly disfigured and in peril.You cannot watch this movie as the ER doc or nurse.  You will see and remember only the graphically accurate spectacle-execution that was Roman crucifixion, which Mel has reproduced so clearly.  You will see a man reduced to busted and bloody parts that cannot and do not survive the day.  You will be one of the disgusted reviewers on this page who thinks the movie was all spurting blood and violence.Put your defenses aside.  There is only one way to watch this movie.  Go as the family in the ER.Yes, this means the impact of the film will slam into you with full force.  That is the point.  That's how you get the full meaning of the film as well.  The movie is not a festival of flying whips, nails and blood without context when you watch it as the family rather than the detached ER practitioner.  Half of this film is spent on both the reactions of those closest to Jesus to the present turmoil and on flashbacks to other moments of Jesus' life and the connection they have to the present torment he is enduring.  The critical quotes from the Gospels are there in the flashbacks to provide context to the sacrifice taking place so vividly before your eyes.  If you take it on squarely and fairly and let the imagery slam home, you may find yourself getting religion.  I did.This will require courage.  It is easier to work yourself up into the tough ER-doc-type, especially on the small screen.  It is much harder to watch with an open mind and an open heart.  Give it a try, though, and you will find the loving context and the happy ending that gave meaning to the violent sacrifice.This is a great movie."	5.0	This is a great movie.	2004-12-14	16	11	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AZAIF7PGLXV3O	"Nick ""Nick"""	"What, exactly, is the point of this film ?  What is its raison d'etre ??Is it to entertain ?  Hardly.  To shock ?  Possibly, but why ?  To reinforce faith ?  Again, I'm not convinced because those who truly have faith would not need images such as these to know why they have faith.No, I believe it's little more than a cynical attempt to cash in on religious beliefs in a time the world would do well to put religious differences aside.  Judging by the reviews it appeals to people who are ""religious"" yet don't really understand why they are religious - the sheep in other words.  It plays the sympathy or pity cards very strongly and it is those which are reinforcing the beliefs of many of those who have seen it.I would be disappointed if people went away from watching this film vowing to turn to religion - there is nothing in the film which should generate such a feeling other than it being out of sympathy.  Hardly a sound basis on which to base one's faith...Some of the imagery is powerful, yet at other times I simply saw trite images designed to enhance the dramatic effect.  The film seemed to switch between a ""factual"" based telling of the stories of the new testament with elements of dramatic fiction interwoven to help build characters and fill in gaps.  It was like watching a cross between a documentary and Gladiator.Sadly I now regard Mr Gibson with the utmost contempt.  This was not a film which needed to be made and it seems little more than one man's selfish indulgence."	1.0	An unnecessary film	2004-10-15	62	31	31

Boy, I was ever wrong. I have seen other depictions of Jesus Christ, but this has to be one of the best. I feel a closer my Jesus christ for his sacrifice. There is no other person that comes before my jesus and his mother mary. I know this has been repeated many times, but it is the truth, I feel the violence was necessary to show the anormity of our lord's sacrifice.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2JI5XVSINN8WO	Nick Wong	"Be forewarned: The Passion of the Christ may induce retching, which it did for me, but not as you would think due to the graphic nature of the subject. No, what impelled me to experience this nausea was the fact that people will go to great lengths (as Mr. Mel Gibson has with his generous allocation) to embellish the tale of Christ's crucifixion with as much brutality and violence as possible in order to leave the viewer with nothing save awe and remorse...remorse at either not being fully aware of ""the price that Christ paid for his/her sins"" or remorse at not having accepted Christ at all. Yes, this is what truly makes me sick.What Mel Gibson did with The Passion of the Christ is nothing more than a reiteration of numerous ""Jesus story"" predecessors, with emphasis on the grotesque brutality. Everything right down to the slovenly Judas Iscariot shown groveling for his thirty shekels to the picturesque scenes of Christ in agony - this film presents it all in its entirety. I had the misfortune of seeing this with predominantly church-going audience, so as you may well assume, there was not a dry eye in the theatre, with the exception of yours truly. This is not to say that I was not disgusted at the barbarism suffered by Jesus at the hands of the Romans in the movie, but my lack of tears were the result of a jaded history of indoctrination and discontent with unanswered questions regarding spiritual and moral matters. If you haven't caught on already, I am an atheist; therefore my opinion will no doubt be an aberration to the floods of reviews that will eventually reside on this subject.The film starts off with the scene of Jesus in his final moments in prayer prior to his betrayal at the hands of Judas. We see the devil (wonderfully played by Sinead O'Connor) taunting him as he kneels in reverence, and the eventual arrival of the soldiers to take away the Jehovah. As the film progresses, flashbacks are intertwined with the crucifixion in order to cast a more impassioned examination at the one of whom has possession of millions upon millions of souls. Let me emphasize: there is a copious amount of blood and gore involved with the crucifixion, albeit not in a fashion that horror/gore fanatics will appreciate (or maybe?) As the crucifixion continues, I found myself checking my watch. Of course I knew how the story was going to conclude, but I was curious in the manner Gibson would present it. However, after an hour, I was convinced that there wouldn't be anything really special about this movie. Like I stated before, it's a rehash of all the films you've already seen, be it in Sunday school or in your own home (with a little persuasion from your fundamentalist Christian mother, perhaps?) Of course Christ (played by James Caviezel) is nothing short of gorgeous while naturally, the Pharisees are hideously sinister and just downright evil (and no, I'm not Jewish). After Jesus is beaten, flogged and forced to carry his cross (not without falling numerous times), he is pinned like a butterfly to the wooden edifice that is symbolized as a constant reminder to Christians everywhere that God loves to use excessive violence in order to win people over to his side. After the death of Christ, Sinead, err, the devil jiggles his body in a celebratory (I would assume, but I think it could be left to interpretation) manner upon a cracked wasteland, which I just assumed was hell.This is a great propaganda film which will ultimately have touched the hearts of many an unbeliever, which is a bit ironic to me considering how the Moral Majority constantly touts Hollywood as being the eventual downfall of all that is morally upright and good.If you absolutely need a reason to see this film, and you're a sadist, then this film has plenty of uncomfortable scenes for you. If you're a sane and rational person, you'll either want to see it for the stunning Mary Magdelene (Monica Bellucci) or just because no one will stop talking about it. Another interesting thing about this movie is that it is done completely in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew languages (with English subtitles of course), which I found pleasing to the ears. And if you really don't care about seeing this film, you're not missing out on anything at all. There's no new material here."	2.0	Lavishly unsavory.	2004-02-24	64	21	43

This is a two hour torture sequence.  How can someone see this five times in the movie theater and proclaim that it, ""..gets better with each viewing..""?Why the four stars?  Well it IS a very powerful film.  One of the most dramatic I've ever seen.  Mel Gibson should at least be seen as a consummate filmaker for his ability to stir up so many emotions and cause people to look away and cry for thirty minutes after the movie.  This movie pulled all of that off and much more, causing religious, philosophical, and historical debates amongst thousands of moviegoers.  It definately DOES stay with you after the viewing.  The acting is superb all around and the musical score is outstanding.I thought it was unfortuante, however, that there was very little representation of Jesus' actual teachings in the movie.  We are never really shown why we should all care about Jesus getting tortured.  Gibson apparently assumes too much of the audience.  Either that or he didn't want any preaching to get in the way of his visions of gore.  I'm not even a Christian, but Jesus had some pretty noble things to say.  It's a shame that this movie does little to bring those words to the movie-going masses.Oh yeah, the plot:  Jesus dies........That's it.  Two hours of Jesus getting tried and murdered.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2CTYN53JMS0YH	N. Mamula	Movies can be depressing, exciting, expressive, influential, and the list goes on.  The key as a director is to capture as many of these traits as possible while making a simple modern film.  Some have accomplished feat, however not many.  Mel Gibson, with hard work and descriptive work accomplished when he directed The Passion Of Christ.  The film can be described with countless adjectives, including depressing, motivating, and accurate -to name a few-.  Mel takes you through the last days of what are known to be Jesus Christ's life.  He uses direct interpretations from the Bible, while adding his own opinions on what he believes happened thousands of years ago.  I recommend every person in the world to watch this movie.  Even though at times it can be gruesome and very gory, the theme and idea of the film are the key importance.  Even though half the world may not be Christian this film will definitely broaden the rest of the world's minds'.  Many directors have attempted to recreate the stories of the Bible, and most of them have failed with little or no success.  The Passion Of Christ took modern technology to the limits and excelled by being accepted by the current audience.  This film has taken historical interpretation to a new level.  My only request is that kids under the age of 18 should not be able to see this film.  For one, they will be more likely to understand the meaning behind the film if they are of age.  Second, modern children have been exposed to a great deal of violence; they should witness this film when they are able to distinguish between what is fiction, and what is plausible.	5.0	A Must See	2004-10-11	6	3	3

I have been down that road before, and logic and reason have shown me the light.  That having been said, let's start the review...This movie is very well done.  The makers payed very close attention to detail and did not shy away from things people usually find offensive (violence).  This movie is not afraid to be bloody, cruel, or nasty.  What impressed me the most was the fact that they kept the whole hocus pocus, supernatural part of the story to a minimum.  The fact that none of the lines were in English was also a big plus.  That is a detail that I fully support when it comes to making a film such as this believable. The directing and cinemetogrophy are both top notch, but this was to be expected.There is an awesome whipping scene that is just fun to watch becuase it is as close to realistic as possible.  I don't understand why people freak out about that scene and go home and have a nice steak dinner.Bottom line:  Very well put together movie.  This is apparent whether you are a Christian or not.

Not the scriptures, not an epiphany; a movie. And to that end, remember to view it as a movie; try not to let your emotions or faith overrule your logic, if that make sense.I gave this four stars for its relative adherence to the Bible; sure, there were some discrepancies; there always are in films of this nature. But basically, it stuck to the story. The cinematography was excellent. Some of the symbolism (Satan, the raindrop/tear) was kind of heavy-handed, and the acting, for what it was, ranged from competent to very good. While I give Jim Caviezel his props -- it wasn't an easy role by any means -- I also think that a number of other actors could have handled the role just as well, if not perhaps a bit better. But that's just all opinion.And that's what Passion comes down to for all of us. Whether or not it supports your faith, gives you religion, etc., is, again, a personal thing. But as a film (and it is a film, remember) my feeling is that even though we know Jesus suffered horribly, the blow-by-blow Gibson offered was kind of over the top; that much graphic in-your-face violence I think, proved almost counter-productive to the point he was trying to emphasize; there's a thin line there that's easy to cross, and he stepped over it more than once. The idea of unrelenting pain can be conveyed far more deeply, I think, by image and suggestion rather than image alone. True, the violence in Passion was far ""purer"" that that in, say, Kill Bill or Lethal Weapon, in terms of its representation, but raw violence is still raw violence. And one needs to know its limits. I'm not a squeamish person by any means; I've seen lots of gorefest flicks. But when I saw Passion, there was a point when I wanted to jump up and say ""Enough!! We get the point, OK??""And for all those who say ""That's what it was like!"" ""He's showing it as it happened!"" ""The film is historically accurate"" They're all incredibly pretentious statements. The fact is, neither you or anyone else -- INCLUDING all the experts who attest that the film was accurate-- knows exactly what it was like unless they were there. You have to accept that; it'snot a matter of faith but fact. NOBODY knows for sure.Anti-Semetic? Please. First off, not all Jews came off badly; only those under Caiphas' influence. It's like saying all Americans are racists because some of them belong to the Klan.Second, if anyone came off as really nasty here, it was the Romans. They were -- those soldiers in Judea, that is -- portrayed as completely sadistic almost throughout.Bottom line: watch Passion for whatever reason you wish. If it strengthens your faith, that's great. But push that start button understanding that you're seeing a movie depicting historical events, not history itself.OH... as far as this DVD having no special features... in a year, will anyone care about directors' commentary or how they did something?"	4.0	Ultimately, you have to make up your own mind...	2004-08-31	3	0	3

What of the millions of people tortured and murdered during the Inquisition and Crusades?  What of the Holocaust victims? What of the attempted genocide of the Bahai's? These savagries were performed in the name of God and under the aegais of different belief structures.So, what is the message here?  That God is love?  If so, then why would that God demand that his son be tortured?  Is the message that Christ suffered?  Then ask how many other faiths have been persecuted at the hands of the ruling religions.

He was able to see every single piece of Jesus's flash fall down from his body and it seems that every single drip of blood has been captured on film in this horrible version of Jesus of Nazareth fairytale.Yes cinematography, score, direction, costumes, and all technical aspects are amazing, and deserve all Oscars and Golden Globes, but to me it seems that Mel Gibson only wanted to scare poor religious people with one of the bloodiest movies I have ever seen in my life. Was it really necessary to make it so bloody? Well yes, I would say it was good, but not necessary. Don't get me wrong, as I enjoyed watching this torture from technical aspect, as no matter how hard it was to watch, the movie has been filmed in such brilliant way? So what is the problem I have with this movie then? Well no one knows how long Jesus has been tortured, so it seems that our dear Mel has decided to go to the maximum just in case. In his mind he probably said: ""Let's show suffering in every possible way, from every single angle, and let's poke Jesus just for fun, and add spraying blood too."" Well all that was ok to the point, but then this poking-cutting flesh party just became the focus of the movie itself. It started being truly silly half-way through. Mel, OK we get it, he suffered, and we noticed that. The movie was obviously made to scare poor brainwashed Christians, and make them even more aware of Jesus's pain. Like it wasn't enough that these people already live pointless life for pointless cause. Whatever!Beside technical aspect, Monica Belluci shines in this movie and so does the lady who plays Mary, and that's about it. Mel Gibson does the good job as director, but it is pointless. This movie and effort could have been saved for another person who suffered in its life and deserves to be portrayed based on the facts that can be proven, like what Spielberg did with Shindler's List, but this PASSION just isn't worthy enough. Let's keep it in the fantasy/drama section right beside Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. Let's just hope Mel Gibson and his producers don't get an Oscar for best movie.And yes, this movie is very anti-Semitic, and that's a good thing.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	"It has taken me about three months to work up the nerve to go see this movie.  It opened in theaters back in February, but I didn't watch it until just this weekend.  I had heard all the press coverage about just how horrible and graphic the scenes of Jesus' torture and crucifixion were, and felt more than a little uneasy about the thought of viewing it myself.  I was expecting the absolute worst, so to some extent I guess it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Still, there has never been (nor likely again will be) such a realistic and gut-twisting depiction of our Lord's sufferings on behalf of fallen men.As a committed follower of Jesus, I found the entire story to be both familiar in one sense, i.e., I know the gospel accounts of Jesus' trial and execution, while in another sense it provided new and fresh insights into events that I previously could only visualize in my imagination.  This additional dimension to the story can only add to my (and every other true believer's) level of love and worship for Jesus and what he did for me.  When I was at church yesterday, I was immediately enthralled during the worship time as images from this movie were firmly fixed in my mind.I would urge every Christian to view this film soberly and with a great deal of reflection on just what an awful price was required to pay the penalty for our sins.  And bear in mind that the physical torture paled in comparison to the horrific spiritual punishment that God the Father heaped on Jesus in that terrible moment of judgment.  Only after the physical sacrifice was accompanied by the spiritual judgment of sin could Jesus say ""It is finished.""  If we take this to heart, we would not be nearly so complacent or cavalier in our attitudes toward our sin or obedience to the revealed will of God.  What a wake-up call!My only criticisms are these:  first, although by and large Jim Caviezel played his role marvelously, there were several scenes where he simply gave in to melodrama.  In my mind this diminished the overall impact of the film.  Second, I was troubled by Mel Gibson's injection of certain details that are not recorded in scripture, but are merely matters of Catholic tradition -- for example, the towel with the bloody imprint of Jesus' face.  My problem with this isn't that I'm a protestant, it's that when Mel Gibson does such things he departs from the scriptural account and takes license that I believe is unjustified in portraying this event.  The bulk of the film is quite true to the biblical record, and I just wish Mel had kept it that way for the whole.My final critique, and probably the most important, is that I would have liked to have seen this story set in the context of a fuller presentation of the gospel account, rather than limit the surrounding narrative to a series of limited flashbacks.  A person who approaches this film without a certain familiarity with the gospels will have a hard time piecing together just why Jesus had to suffer and die as he did, and just what his death accomplished.  The most striking illustration of the need for broader context is the scene where Mary Magdalene is saved from stoning.  Not a word is spoken in that scene, and thus it is unlikely that someone who hasn't read John chapter 8 would understand what is going on in this scene.Overall, I think Mel Gibson did a wonderful job in telling this story, insofar as he chose to portray it.  Notwithstanding all the controversy, the rejection by the Hollywood establishment, and the cries of antisemitism, I have no doubt that this movie is destined to be one of the all-time greats.  The marketplace has already vindicated Mel Gibson, and I trust that the Lord will use this film for the advancement of his kingdom."	4.0	A reality check for complacent Christians.	2004-05-17	9	7	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	"I wanted to like The Passion of the Christ. I can honestly say that I went to the movie with an open and favorable mind. I believe this is a movie that God will use to build His kingdom, but it is also fundamentally flawed.I have to say that this movie never really did its job in suspending my disbelief (as a member of the audience that is-not as a Christ-follower). Except for moments here and there I never got past the feeling of watching actors playing roles in a film.Perhaps this was because the movie does not tell the real story of the gospels. Perhaps the false and sometimes corny nature of the poetic license distracted me. Perhaps the movie just isn't that well done. I don't know what kept me from getting ""into"" the world of this movie.But I do know this...I was disturbed by this movie in two big ways.First, I was disturbed yet again by the unbelievable grace of God through his Son Jesus Christ. It never fails to rattle me to my core no matter how it is presented. This movie gives the most clear picture yet of what Jesus suffered in his final hours-though this movie is still a little soft-core in presenting a standard Roman state execution.The second way this movie disturbed me is the reason why I feel I have to throw my two-cents worth the discussion on this film. This film, while containing a skeleton that resembles the true Gospel, fails greatly in its faithfulness not only to the letter of its text, but its spirit.I can bear a gospel story that uses some poetic license. But the pieces which are interjected into this film are not only unnecessary and bizarre, they are theologically divisive and, in places, doctrinally inexcusable.The constant appearances by an androgynous and sinister looking Satan are a case in point. While I feel the initial temptation scene might even have had its place, echoing as it does the temptation of Eve and the first Adam in Eden, the rest of his appearances are foolishly used-being both Biblically unfaithful (after all, the real Satan masquerades as an Angel of light, not some bald weirdo in black) and a distraction from the focus on Christ's gift to us.The license with the story of Judas and the story of the ""Bad Thief"" are even more bizarre. The pecking out of the thief's eyes is not only poor license but bad theology. Here we have Jesus next to him praying for God to forgive everyone because they don't know what they are doing, and then whoosh... down flies Mr. Raven in what can only be seen as an act of (divine?) vengeance.The worst theology is regrettably that which is related to how Jews are depicted. Throughout the pre-publicity flap about this movie I refused to believe the charges of anti-Semitism. I still don't want to bandy such a term about loosely. Yet there are things in this movie that need explaining.I do not believe the Bible is anti-Semitic. I believe it to be God's holy and perfect word. My problem is not with any of the words from the Bible. My problem is with depictions of individuals, and of crowds.It is a problem when Pilate is made to look like a reluctant, would-be nice guy and Caiaphas is made to look like a want-to-be executioner.  In the Biblical text, both act with expediency rather than out and out desire. Caiaphas does so actively, Pilate passively. Yet both find their vested interests of greater value than human life-an indictment that covers the entire world which they as Gentile and Jew represent.Christ was willingly crucified by the whole world in order to fulfill God's will that all might be saved. In the movie it is not so. The blame wrongly finds its way to the feet of Caiaphas and to the feet of the Jews.Other little things, like the depiction of Herod and various such oddities trouble me as well.Yet in the end I believe that God can use even a movie as troubled as this for his purposes. However, I recommend other movies, such as The Miracle Maker much more highly."	2.0	whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached...	2004-03-01	22	7	15

However when I first heard about this film's release, I was quick to inquire about the times it would be playing at the nearest multiplex on the release date. I was curious to see what spin this director (Gibson) would put on the telling of the story of the Christ. It so happens that I also subscibe to the ""don't knock it till you've tried it"" theory.Fast foward to the last twenty minutes of the film (the crucifixion scene), I'm thinking ""okay...this is pretty okay. Not the greatest film ever, but good.""Fast foward one hour later, Im thinking ""okay... so is there anything new I have learned from this film?"" The answer to that question was NO!Fast forward two days later (the film tends to stay with you for a while), I'm thinking ""okay... so what happens in the film? A man gets arrested, prosecuted, beat the crap from and crucified. Is that it? Isn't there any thing else for me to take with me? Suprisingly to me, the answer was NO!So why the heck did I think the film was pretty good in the first place?I then came up with the idea to find everything that was good about the film, so I could better understand why I felt it was good in the first place.I thought about this for days, till finally I came up with one thing good about the film. The VISUALS! I pondered a few more days. Nothing else came up.Wow, so this is all the movie is. Visually stunning and nothing else.To me, this story is just the unfortunate death of a young man who got himself killed by stirring up controversy proclaiming to be a god of some kind.Maybe the overtly religious will see someting in this lackluster of a film.

May not be what some were expecting, but of those that knew Jesus firsthand, followed Him didn't expect Him to be treated so maliciously either even though they were told what was about to happen.  The BEST part of the movie is NOT the cross (however that is beautiful all in itself that He loves us that much) but the RESURRECTION!  Why is it not possible for all to see the love that was poured into a people (ALL) that is so undeserving of God's grace.  For the ones that wrote derogatory statements it is sad that they have to condemn someone for their beliefs but are the first to jump on the bandwagon to express theirs so offensively.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A363QRXP83K8ZE	"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155"""	I'm guessing Mel Gibson's target audience was Catholics, and all the better if they were very conservative Catholics like himself.  On the other hand, the story of Christ is a powerful enough story that people of other faiths or even no faith can still understand and appreciate.The film seems to be about the glorification of pain and suffering; there is scene after scene of brutality.  Jesus is arrested early on after his disciples battle the Jewish police.  From there on, the story is dedicated to showing the slappings, punchings, whippings, flayings, scourgings, bludgeonings, nailings, and piercings he endured in the last hours of his life.  We have some flashbacks woven in as Jesus reflects, and only there do we see him teaching his disciples, impressing his philosophy on them so they may carry it on.  Ironically, these sometimes even manage to sidetrack the film because the overall pace is so geared toward the beating.  James Caviezel is depicted like a piece of flayed meat for a good portion of the film.  You'd think that a bit more on the impressive philosophy Christ spoke would make people understand his sacrifice better, but here it's like a footnote to the torture.  If someone who has never heard of Christ or Christianity walks into this movie, what would it tell them?I think you have to be careful when watching a movie like this.  It helps to put the production into context since Bible-based films are so rare these days.  The film is a telling statement by Mel Gibson, one of the few people out there with the clout and the cash to pull something like this off and have it open on thousands of screens.  Apparently he needs to continuously and literally hammer home his point: that Jesus died for our sins and endured tremendous, bone-crunching torture.I don't think all Christians focus on the actual details of the torture--particularly the scourging--as the main point of the faith.  Gibson sure does, though.  I have no problem with film violence.  But it's the fact that Gibson feels the only way to really get his point across is to beat it into his audience that puts this film in murky waters.  He doesn't want people to walk out feeling hopeful or more confidenct about their faith.Jesus takes a tremendous amount of punishment, but then again, so has Mel Gibson in most of his movies.  It's being mentioned because it's an interesting point.  A normal man would be dead after any of the beatings he takes in any of the Lethal Weapon movies.  He is, of course, the same star-director who subjected himself to torture by the English in Braveheart.  He made a film where he had half a face.  He's made films where people are out to get him, kidnap his kids, and ruin his way of life.  And now he's made a movie about the persecution of Christ.  Has his whole career been heading toward this?  Some kind of messianic message of some sort by an incredibly powerful Hollywood figure?The production is good, the camerawork is excellent; Gibson is a more than capable director.  I don't know if James Caviezel is acting so much as enduring.It's a movie that is going to come up in many conversations, so see it and be informed.  Plenty of people will talk about it but won't go and see it.  Avoid that pitfall and go judge for yourself, unless you prefer others to do the thinking for you.The one thing that is very interesting and disturbing is that people are taking kids to see this movie.  It's not a movie for kids, regardless of the subject matter.  You wouldn't take a young kid to see Hellraiser, but to take him to see an incredibly gory film like this because you think it may instill or reinforce faith in God is morally dubious.  It's almost like 'Scared Faithful'.  What Mel Gibson has made his entire career on--violent movies--is now being used as a vehicle for his own particular take on Catholicism.	3.0	Red Meat	2004-02-29	16	8	8

All I can really say is that this is a movie that needs to be experienced for youself.I was disappointed by the fact that the DVD only has language and audio features- no special documentaries or commentaries.  Mel did this so everyone could draw their own conclusion from the movie and do their own research on whether or not the film was accurate and so that you could draw your own conclusion based upon your own experience.In my opinion, I feel that this is the greatest movie ever made to this point- primarily because of the depth and richness of its content and the message portrayed through Christ's suffering.

The gruesome graphic detail becomes so unreal, no man (including the human Son of God) could ever survive. Theologically unsound: the penalty to be paid for the world's Sin was death of the Christ - not His everlasting torture. The Resurrection merits a two minute post-script, hardly an appropriate balance for Easter which is still part of the Passion.

This film is extremely violent and I watched it while my daughter slept. The images are disturbing and ones that you won't be able to burn out of your memory. I've never felt more connected to any other actors in any other movie ever. I especially connected with Mary who endured an unbearble torture that no parent should ever have to suffer. The crowds who gathered to watch feed off each other and are filled with people who want blood. Connections are made with some sympathizers and I felt their empathy and their horror and fear. Even at the end when Jesus is on the cross and his tormentors still do not relent he delivers the line which moved me most of all. Jesus looks up towards the heavens and asks his Father to forgive these men for they know not what they do. There are many gruesome scenes such as the nails being driven in or the crown of thorns being twisted on his head. After watching this I couldn't think about anything else for hours. While some may not agree with the way this moment in history is portrayed here I reccomend everyone watch it. It is a film that will stay with you and one that will make you think about your beliefs. I'm glad that Mel Gibson went against the odds and put this out there so even if we don't agree who is to blame the actual horror of it all is put out there for us to understand.	5.0	Riveting	2004-10-04	6	4	2

This guy lost more blood that the human body possesses but kept on going (oh that's right, this isn't just ANY human being).The movie really failed for me because there was so little character development.  Peter and Judas got a little bit of play, but there were far too many non-entities in this movie.  And what was with Mary, the mother of Jesus.  She had the same look on her face the entire time.This movie to me was terribly depressing.  Focusing on the death of Jesus rather than his rise, his torture rather than his life, it was a morbid movie to say the least.  The message I think Mel Gibson was trying to convey was that because this Jesus fellow suffered so much, that we owe him (errrrrh, the church he supposedly founded through Peter) alot so I guess I'd better straighten up and fly right.I will give credit to the director on one account.  Jesus in this movie actually looked JEWISH! A far cry from the Fabio Germanic Jesus that adorns the walls of so many who call themselves Christians.  That in itself was worthy of a couple of stars.This movie will strengthen the faith of those who already believe.  However, I don't think it spoke to any non-catholic whom Mel hoped would start revering the mother Mary or her son. But maybe that is just me.	3.0	This movie was about torture	2005-02-05	14	6	8

Places all the emphasis on the physical suffering of Christ, not on the true Passion of the Atonement where the Bible does. This film does not give the same restraint in the description of the crucifixion that God did in the Bible. It is unabashedly Catholic. It was Christ's obedience unto death and the judgment from the Father that atoned for our sins. God allowed the Jews to deliver him to the Romans (by design), they didn't help with the Atonement. God allowed the Romans to crucify Him (by design), they didn't help with the Atonement. Mary needed a Savior (Luke 1:47), she didn't help with the Atonement. This film implies that all of those people helped. In fact nothing we can do or ever have done can add to or take away from the Atonement. The agreement and the punishment was between the Father and the Son. We either accept or reject. (Ephesians 2:8-9, Galatians 5:1-12)This is a Catholic Movie with a Catholic Jesus (literally) intended to promote a Catholic works doctrine and an impotent Christ.The Jesus film is better even though it has a very pretty European Jesus and Jesus was a Jew and not a pretty one (Isaiah 53:2).	1.0	Protestants Beware!	2004-02-25	49	16	33

Many conclusions can now be drawn from the bitterness of the attacks that have been leveled, and are still being leveled, at an entire religion, it's founder, and a single film artist. Well, I will not go into the details of every attack but I can atleast offer the following conclusions based soley on some of the negative comments made on this board.1) If you were bold enough to say this movie is not at all biblically accurate - one could deduce that you are the type of character that would read The Da Vinci Code and walk away believing that it was a historically accurate discourse.2) If you stated that this film was ""sadistic porn"" or ""overly violent"" - you probably, by way of hypocrisy, thought Kill Bill was an entertaining work of art.3) If you cited the film as being anti-semitic - you obviously do not know that orthodox Christians believe that Christ died for the sins of humanity and not the sins of a single race (of which he was a part of!!)Well, it is quite apparent that even with all of the negative film reviews, ADL contempt, liberal anti-religious dissent and misguided mythic paganism - this film has proven to be extremely successful. One could almost attribute a quarter of the success to controversy alone but, most of the success can be respectfully given to Christians, like myself, that want to see the history of their religion unaltered by the guise of revisionist history and/or competing religions. Now, this is not to say that the film 100% accurate portrayal of how it was when Christ was tried, scourged and crucified but the quoted scripture in the film was accurate and much of the proceedings were accurate based on historical documents that describe how corporal and capital punishments were conducted at that time."	5.0	The Plethora of Reviews	2004-09-05	10	6	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z	Octavius	After dabbling in his direction of 'Bravehart' and the pathetic 'The Patriot', Mel Gibson now deserves to be placed on the same level as some of the greatest directors in film history such as Ford, Wilder, Kubrick, etc.Gibson's direction of 'The Passion' demonstrates all of the sensitivities of a great director.  The choice of scenes, the camera work, and not to mention the brilliant acting of every single actor in this film is captured with grace.  Seeing the film, one can truly feel every ounce of pain Jesus of Nazareth must have suffered in his torment.  The scenes depicting his torment all seem to be animated versions of Bosch's religious paintings showing ugly distorted grimaces.  Caviezel's performance is singularly outstanding.This film is an outstanding tour-de-force that is unprecedented in the history of film making; especially in light  of preceding films dealing with the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth.

And the actor's curse will no doubt follow him as well: no actor ever recovers his career after portraying the Big Guy. It just finishes you. ""That's your career up there, mate.

I believe that it is a wonderful thing for all Christians to see the pain and suffering that He went through, but the love that He retained throughout the entire ordeal.This movie is VERY GRAPHIC.  You see them hammering the nails into His hands.  Remember how they put a crown of thorns on His head?  Yeah, not put, PUSHED a crown of thorns INTO His head.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2UR38SZPVA07I	ol' nuff n' den sum	Mel Gibson'sThe Passion of the Christ (Widescreen 9Edition)(2004) is obviously a film about the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the several hours leading up to the event. The movie's title explains it. The American Heritage Dictionary (Second College Edition) lists as one of it's definitions of Passion:5. Passion. a. The sufferings of Christ in the period following the Last Supper and including the Crucifixion. b. A narrative of this, as in one of the Gospels, or a musical setting or serial pictorial representation of it.There has been a lot of criticism of this controversial film, and while everybody is certainly entitled to their opinion, I think that most of the complaints actually reveal more about the critics than the film. Chances are that these people will not like The Passion:1. Atheists/Agnostics who see all believers as gullible and this film as an exploitation device.2. People who dislike Mel Gibson3.Country Club Christians who think that the film is too violent, and that it doesn't focus enough on the teachings of Jesus.4. People who think the film unfairly places blame on the Jews for Jesus' arrest and death.The Passion of the Christ (Widescreen Edition)is a movie that I believe Gibson made with the faithful followers of Jesus as his target audience. It's a difficult film to watch, and non-believers really won't find much reason (other than to look for imperfections) to sit through it and watch the lusty and senseless slaughter of the innocent Lamb of God.The movie was filmed in Italy and is a visual wonder. The music is especially inspiring (the film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Original Score). The actors speak in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew (with subtitles).The Passion of the Christ (Widescreen Edition)isn't a documentary or docu-drama; it tells the story of an event. Some folks believe that Gibson went overboard with the violence in the film to make a personal statement, but I disagree. I think that Gibson made this film to inspire people and offer them hope. Some reviewers have mistakenly commented that Jesus was not whipped or beaten while in captivity.Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.Matthew 27:26 NIVThe Passion inspires by bringing to light the divine example of how Jesus endured even the most horrible, unjust and cruel punishment with dignity, fortitude and forgiveness. Jesus suffered just like we all do, and we can learn from and be inspired by His example.The Passion of the Christ (Widescreen Edition)is remarkable, not because of the proverbial wisdom or supernatural abilities of the Son of God, but for the human fragility and steadfast devotion of the Son of Man.	5.0	THE PASSION IS INSPIRED, AFFECTING AND SOMETIMES DEMANDING.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A7QY85L7Y289K	One Callin'	This is a great movie.  I find it amazing that the people who gave this movie a one star rating do it only because it was full of gore.  Seriously?  So you wanted another fake, bloodless movie about Jesus' gruesome death?  It is a mockery of the death of Jesus to show it in any other way.  Other movies are so fake--they show Jesus getting beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross and he comes out of it looking as if nothing more had happened to him than he maybe got a few bad paper cuts.  It's about time someone showed it like it was.  If you don't like the gore...maybe you could pray REAL hard and ask God to go back in time and make the beating, flogging, and crucifixion of Jesus less bloody because it offends you.  I read one review that said that Mel just wants us all to feel guilty for doing this to Jesus because He did it for our sins.  That's so ridiculous it hardly deserves a response.  Maybe instead we should look at it in the light that Jesus loved us so much that He came to earth to save us KNOWING that this is exactly what would happen to Him--ever bit of pain He felt, He knew He would feel that before He came to earth.

I will admit that it dragged a little at the begining until you were aware of the subtitles and then you could go forward in the movie.This movie became real to me when the Roman soldiers whipped Jesus so hard that even they (the soldiers) became tired!  It showed the strength and determination of Christ's love for mankind.I wanted to reach out to him (Christ) when he fell, but when he got up to take it all over again, I thought within myself ""He did that for me, showing me never to give up when life gets you down, or when you have failed over and over again, God will give you a second chance and the strength to try it ONE MORE TIME""As I watched this movie the Bible came to life in every scene!It hurt to see what happened to Jesus and all that he went through, but I know he did it just for me.I am thankful for what he did because no ordinary person(man or woman)would have given up so much for just little ole me!This movie caused me to fall in love with Jesus Christ,(because this was a serious act he did for mankind) it allowed me to grow in him and to learn more about him and in everything else he did just for me and mankind.Not only did he die on the Cross, but the ministry that he lived is a true example of how man should live day by day.God bless!"	5.0	Awsome movie to see	2004-04-29	12	7	5

Yes there will be critics that say this film wasnt as clear about Jesus's life as some other films, which is true, but it wasnt meant to.  It was meant to show people, assuming they probably knew the story of Christ, Jesus's last few hours.  As a ""movie"" I wouldnt necessarily want to see it again and again just because it IS very violent and I personally cannot watch it without not feeling too well.

An exercise in tight-focus sado-masochism, the effect of which is to send people out of the theatre roused to a frenzy of grief and rage that they then direct -- where?  At anybody who's not a fanatical worshipper of the person they claim as their god.  The thing has no value as a story -- no dramatic tension (yup, they're just gonna him him again until he's dead), no nuance, no depth, no nothing -- except the crazed wallowing in physical suffering that has characterized more than one of this distinctly kinked movie-maker's previous screen outings.This movie is a bloody mess in every sense of the word.  Seems to me that Jesus would be horrified and embarrassed by it.  This isn't what he came here to communicate, but rather a lot of hysterical kerfuffle spun by lots of other people, who were or weren't there (which doesn't seem to matter to devoted -- self-styled -- ""Christian"" fanatics, who'll believe anything that comes with the world ""Bible"" attached to it, no matter how nutty).

Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views, Mel Gibson, a schizo if there ever was one, does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ, who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious ""crucifixion"" which ""saved man"", but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since, especially by the Catholic Church.

I think it took a genius to make this movie in Aramek which is the language that Jesus spoke 2000 years ago and it is very interesting to see Him speak in that language.

And don't be put off by the subtitles. The plot and morality play are simple enough for any children's movie, which is what this is (think Brothers Grimm fairy tale).However, it was perhaps the most anti-semitic movie I've seen. While Jesus and the ""good guys"" all looked European, I suspect the makeup crew needed prosthetic noses to make sure all the Pharisees looked appropriately ""Jewish."" And the Pharisees were straight out of ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion."" Nothing but vitriolic stereotype. Apart from the funny parts--like when Jesus builds a table for a rich client or when he bungee jumps off a bridge--""The Passion"" is just an update of ""The Eternal Jew"" from 1940.Along with B-movie Sci Fi, creature-features and your favorite zombie classics, ""The Passion"" is a great film for that Halloween ""Fright Night"" movie marathon at home for the kids (where's MST3K when you need them).

Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways, finally died. Yes, you will see how Jesus suffered and died, vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however, quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes, extra features, casting, or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest, say if the man in the film is not Jesus, would you rate it the same?

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"With all due respect to the media reporting on this major art film I was surprised to find myself witnessing a movie that simply obliterated the `gore' boundaries set by horror classics such as ""Last House on the Left"", ""Dead Alive/Brain Dead"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""Cannibal Ferox"", ""Faces of Death"" and ""Men Behind the Sun"". Next to ""Irreversible"" this film is probably the only real shocker to come out in years. If the subject matter had been anything other than the trial and execution of Jesus Christ it would hard to image this getting a release in most countries. In fact Sunday school is about to take a very brutal twist that even the most seasoned of ""gore-hounds"" will have trouble stomaching.Here, in The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson gives us 127 minutes of non-stop graphic and violent torture sequences. Once the screaming starts it DOES NOT STOP! It has been a long time since cinema has driven home such powerful and disturbing imagery. In one sequence a huge visible chunk of Jesus' chest is torn away by a clawed cat-o-nine tails to reveal his ribs underneath. By the end of the movie Jesus is virtually half a skeleton with most of his body tissue removed and bone chipped away. It is the first time many of us have seen these images outside of a ""Slayer"" album cover and Gibson has turned the tables on what we could conventionally conceive in our minds as the murder of Christ. Nowhere in cinema has this subject be treated with the absolutely truthfulness and respect that it deserved. The actual term for these proceedings (the last twelve hours of Christ) is called - ""Deicide"" (The act of killing a being of a divine nature; particularly, the putting to death of Jesus Christ). The Passion of the Christ in wholly and indisputably a hell of a cinematic challenge for a rendition of ""Decide"" as it has never been seen before. You will not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen. When you come out of the cinema it is probably best if you take a lie down somewhere and contemplate what you have just witnessed. You have NEVER seen anything like this before... nor will you want to again.The Passion of the Christ does not go into much detail about the life of Jesus or anything much biblical. In fact it is more akin to watching ""No Comment"" on Euro News (basically news reports with just video images) and letting you make up your own mind. For those of you who are not informed about what the life of Jesus was before he was crucified then you would do well to watch some early Hollywood production of the man's life (even though The Passion of the Christ is NOTHING like anything Hollywood has put out before). Jesus does say the odd line now and again but mostly this is a story about physical and mental suffering and there is no shortage of that as the film descends into depths that cinema has not treaded on before and where angles would fear to go. The film starts in the Garden of Olives following the Last Supper and Jesus' encounter with Satan (the only flaw in the film was Gibson's overuse of these pantomime type evil characters and their satanic servants, rendered needlessly in CGI and do not really fit this picture that much in the same way that Jar Jar Binks did fit well with Star Wars Episode1.). Judas Iscariot cuts a deal with the Pharisees, who then pick Jesus up, torture him and humiliate him, before sending Jesus to a Roman trial to face charges of blasphemy. There are many moments of absolute unflinching horror throughout the ordeal even before the first whip is unleashed, however these are cleanly swept aside by the little miracles that occur along the way but it would only spoil it for you to tell you what these are (a scene involving the cross being turned over is one of the most startling shots ever committed to celluloid and is sure to raise a few hairs). These little miracle moments are extremely powerful and are captured wonderfully by the glorious cinematography (The Passion of the Christ looks simply divine).All in all it is hard to call this film a movie or an art-film. It is more akin to an `out of control' dramatic crime scene recreation that we see on true life law enforcement television programs, but here it is all uncut and does not shy away from exposing us to unrestrained, raw and unlimited amounts of human hatred and aggression. Forget the whole ""Anti-Semitic"" lark that the media went on about. The film clearly explains that Jesus, the son of God, was God, and chose his own fate. The fact that Jews or Roman's where involved is only incidental to them being there. They are the same as anyone else who could not see with open eyes! In fact under all the blood, bruises, bone and bumps Gibson manages to leave Christ's right eye intact. He highlights this eye at times with a subtle illumination that carries an `all seeing' message with it and is another strong imagery device that is used in this production. It is the little things like this that make the film ingenious in a `clever' Spielberg sort of way. However when all is said and done Martin Scorsese' The Last Temptation of Christ can still hold its own against this offering, however this one is certainly eons more disturbing.This is not a film you will enjoy but you will be damn glad that you went to see it and certainly since the original Matrix there has not been a good soul shaker doing the rounds in a long time.

But this is one Holy Turkey, for behind all the blood, violence, controversy and gore, lies a very silly picture.At its core, the film states that Christ redeemed humanity by enduring more physical abuse than any other man in history, if not mankind altogether. That's not only false but absurd, and taken to extremes, utterly ridiculous. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop Mr. Gibson: his Christ goes through such outlandish beatings -one more preposterous than the last- that any skeptical viewer ends up laughing well before Our Lord gets nailed to the cross. Is this Jesus Christ we're talking about, or is it John McClane?No, seriously: early in the movie, even before he's taken to the Sanhedrin, Jesus is thrown off a bridge while tied to a rope (a torture not recorded in any Scripture but Mel's). Inches from the ground the fall stops in what surely looks like a paraplegic lesion at its very least. Any human body subjected to such injury would be unable to stand up or walk, let alone sustain a flogging, or carry a heavy burden. But this Jesus takes that and more. Hell, if Martin Riggs can take it, why not God? That's why He gave his Only Son such chiseled Caviezel abs!And what's with the demonic fellow, by the way? Why must there be a physical bad guy in the movie to incarnate Evil? Isn't all that violence enough? Satan is such an obvious clich&eacute;, audiences can anticipate his every move. For instance, having betrayed Jesus, Judas is on his way to hang himself when he sees a woman carrying a veiled child. Just as the baby's head starts to turn, we already know he's going to be a ghoulish sight. Sillier still: at the very moment Christ expires, the Devil shouts in agony ""NOOOOOO..!"" and disappears, just like a vampire on a stake would. A choir of angels singing ""Ding, Dong, the Demon's Dead!"" should follow.Superman vs. Goblins. Come on; is this the extent of Mr, Gibson's faith? Let's hope not.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3AO43B9ZIC6UI	Pamela Powers	"This is the best depiction of Jesus' crucifixion I have ever seen, & probably will EVER see, in my life. Every frame is a work of art...I was moved to tears, much more than once. During the crucifixion, I turn to my sides & I see the people beside me crying as much as I was. When the lights dimmed back, after the movie ended, there was COMPLETE silence: not even a cough. The audience, & myself, were struck so deep by the movie. We all just sat there for a while, starring at the screen...amazed by everything...still soaking it all in. It was unbelievable.As for the Satan parts, I thought they were just another thing Mel Gibson added to separate his Jesus movie from the others. I say this in a GOOD way. No other Jesus movie showed the hands get nailed into the cross. No other Jesus movie showed the beatings & the blood that was spilt for everyone. No other Jesus movie showed Satan drive Judas to his death, tempt Jesus, or to basically tell the Roman's to beat Jesus until there was almost no flesh remaining. It's just one more thing to make it a differnt style of painting, of the exact same picture.As for the ""blaming the Jews for Jesus death"" part...there is no blame! This movie was not made to play a ""blame game"". If you are going to see the movie to try to find anti-Semitic parts in the film: don't waste your time & money! I'd rather have a person sit beside me in the theater who is there to be moved by the death of Jesus Christ than to try to find things wrong with a Mel Gibson movie.The violence in the movie was there for a reason. How can you show a movie about Jesus being beaten & crucified without showing the true gore of it all? All the past Jesus movies showed 5% of the gore shown in ""The Passion"" & no other Jesus movie has moved audiences, & myself, as much as this movie has! Jesus was not just beaten for a while & put up on a cross...he was beaten brutally with sharp weapons, his hands were nailed to a cross, & he died a long, painful death. No other movie than this has bothered to go into such detail. The violence is truly what stays with you; it is burned into your mind after you've seen it. You no longer think lightly of the death of Christ.At the beginning of the movie I saw Jim Caviezel, I remembered a man I've seen from ""Frequency"" & ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"". By the end of the film...I saw Jesus, I felt as though I saw Jesus die before my eyes. The acting is so Oscar-worthy in every way! This movie is not made to offend anyone, or to blame anyone for the death of Christ. It is to depict the awful, gruesome death of Christ & the message he gave the world before he left: love one another. BOTTOM LINE: anyone who can take the violence of the film should see it. It's a great, unforgettable movie that deserves every Oscar there is. Anyone who can't take the violence, or is simply trying to find anti-Semitic parts, shouldn't see it! They'll find things in the movie whether it's there or not."	5.0	The movie ends...the credits begin...you're struck with AWE!	2004-02-27	2	1	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A34QGQBK06S8CH	Pamela S. Bower	I recall watching the movie for the first time in the theaters, and being deeply emotionally moved.  As I watched, I thought one of the most moving scenes was when Jesus fell to His knees due to the burden of the cross, after being severely beaten.  His mother looked at Him, and remembered when He was a little boy, and had just skinned His knee, but now could do nothing.  He looked at her and said the most profound words &#34;see, mother, I make all things new&#34;.  At that point,I lost it, and began weeping profusely.  as i watched Him die on the cross, I was reminded of the bible passages I have read all my life, that spoke of Jesus being fully God and fully man, was sinless, and He could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world, and set Him free.  Then I remembered:  He did all these things for me.  He bridged a gap I could not possibly cross.  My sin had destroyed a beautiful relationship with God, starting with Adam.  He was perfect, I was not.  In order to restore a broken relationship, He had to, because of His perfect righteousness, condemn my sin.  God chose to place the sin I so rightly deserved on Jesus- thus, the Gospel story.As I pondered these things. My heart was full of emotion, and as I left the theater that night, I could only think one thing- I looked at me heart, what was there, my life, and then finally His life, a &#34;man of sorrows&#34;.  who did these thing specifically for me, and i thought: the price was too high.  He shouldn't have done it.  I've read the account in the gospels so many times, but to see it actually portrayed like this was very moving.Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift.  Just think- All we have to do, is accept this beautiful gift, believe Jesus is the Son of God, believe that He died for our sins and rose again, and we will, very soon, look  upon the face of He who bore our sins to provide a way for us-why? because He loved us so much.  Because of His amazing PASSION.	5.0	THE PRICE WAS TOO HIGH	2014-03-15	0	0	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A19JLVWKE8KY0Z	"PappyLove ""Pappy"""	"Most reviewers miss the purpose Mel Gibson had in making this film. This will explain it from a Christian perspective. The crucifixion of Christ is central to all believing Christians. It is their beginning, their end and their rock. Love or hate them, if you expect to understand them read this without developing opinions until the end.Bear with me as I have to lay some groundwork for you to understand my comment. I don't ask you to believe the Bible, only to understand the purpose of the film.The movie is meant for Christians. It is meant to show what Christ did for them and for everyone (whether they understand or not). The Bible was written over a period of 1400 years by 44 different people. It is complicated because it has a number of different messages or themes, of which I will not attempt to cover.For the purpose of this comment, what is central to the Bible are four basic threads. 1) It is a book of prophesy, mostly prophesy about the coming Christ (there are over 100 of these, all of which were fulfilled by Christ). 2) There is the story of his 3 year evangelism, in which He proved by miracles that He was the Christ (prophesied 100's of years earlier). 3) It describes Christ's sacrifice, death and resurrection (proving that Christ has power over death). 4) It describes what a Christian is to exhibit in their life (How they are to live).You may believe the Bible is a total fake, I am not defending it. But that does not change what I state above. Those four threads exist in the Bible. That is fact. I need to say that in order to explain the reason for the film.The Bible states that God sent Christ, His Son, to be a sacrifice for all. Before Christ, Jews had to sacrifice animals to absolve them of sins but animals were not perfect sacrifices. Christ had to be a PERFECT sacrifice. He was (Proven by Jewish history and their losing their homeland). Also to fulfill the prophesy given 700 years before His arrival (see Isaiah chapter 53), that He had to suffer the terrible punishment you see in Gibson's film.Let me pause. Non-Christians will find it implausible, inexcusable and abhorrent that any god would be part of the acts seen in the film or in my statements. To make it even more confusing, God is a loving God. He wants only good for everyone. Talk about something inexplainable!It is a waste of time for me to try and explain or defend this. You can discard the Bible as fiction but it is what is written on its pages. In that, there can be no dispute.The Bible is unique in history. There is no book that is a compilation of different authors where they all agree and present a cohesive message, let alone doing it over a period of more than a thousand years.So what was the purpose behind such a violent, unpleasant film?Christians understand that Christ was a sacrifice for their sin, allowing them to enter the Kingdom of God. But before seeing the film, I did not really comprehend it on a visceral level. If I am an example, the film is a success; ""It was important that I experience His sacrifice"". If you feel that you, your church or group will benefit from a better understanding of Christ's sacrifice, get the film. It has no equal in its scope or purpose.That was the purpose of ""The Passion of Christ."" It shows the price that God and Christ really paid so that Christians could enter the kingdom.I can hear someone saying, ""Whoop Eee Doo."" See! That proves my point that most reviewers do not understand the film. Some will feel my comment is crazy, stupid or worse. That does not change the truth presented here. Remember that I only present what the Bible states, not asking you to believe it.If you question me and want to investigate on your own, go to the Internet. There is a free Biblical resource that will help you look into it. In your search engine, type ""eSword"" to find the site. I've always believed that the truth is revealed when you understand all sides of an issue.If you want to look into the existence of Christ, investigate the ""Shroud of Turin"" on the Internet. It is believed by many that this is the shroud that covered Christ when His body was laid in the tomb. It is a controversial but a fascinating story.If you want to look into whether history and archeology back up the Bible, look up ""Ron Wyatt"" on the Internet. He was an amateur student of Biblical history and discovered some interesting facts. As with all things relating to the Bible, everything has its naysayers so you can come to your own conclusions."	5.0	What is the REAL reason for the film?	2012-03-08	4	1	3

Mel Gibson's direction of ""The Passion of the Christ"" focuses on the brutal inhumanity of man-on-man, using the most graphic Twenty-First Century technical imagery available.Beginning with the seizure of ""Jesus"" by Roman soldiers, at 3:00 am in the ""Garden of Gethsemane"", through the time of ""Jesus'"" crucifixion and death, we see physical pain, torturously inflicted.  Many scenes focus on the extreme physical torture of ""Christ"", and this viewer developed the pain of empathy.  Acts of brutality beyond my understanding and acceptance are written in the Bible.  Actor Jim Caviezel's physical transition throughout this film is very graphic.  Certain scenes required that Caviezel spend more than ten hours in make-up before the cameras began filming.Music filling the background of dialogue, spoken in the Aramaic language of the time (with subtitles), adds to the church choir and celestial spirit mood and tone that pervade this film.  The music alone may bring on emotions one associates with religion.  The setting feels realistic, and the structure of the staging area is true to what has been described.Maia Morgenstern as ""Mary, Mother of Jesus Christ"", plays her role to admirable perfection, despite being hidden in simple dark clothes and having few lines, portraying much through her eyes.  Likewise, Monica Bellucci as ""Mary Magdalene"" is present, then absent, then present, as ""Christ"" carries his crucifix up the hill.  Hristo Naumov Shopov, as ""Pontius Pilot"", washes his hands, though I never imagined a silent but opinionated wife in view.My desire not to see this film again is due to my views regarding excessive violence.

Randall	"John 3:16:  ""For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have eternal life"".For many years, I knew of that passage in the bible and even superficially understand what it meant.  It wasn't until I saw the movie, ""The Passion"" that I truly felt and internally understood what verse signified.  Now, I will never forget its meaning.  There has never been a more graphic and vivid visualization of the God love for humankind by sacrificing his only son so that we should have see Heaven.  Director Mel Gibson's powerful and striking work of devotion is one of the most remarkable and memorable motion pictures I have ever seen.  In telling the story of the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus Christ, Gibson crafts an epic that is both brutal and touching.  No on who sees this movie will be same after watching it.Any film that attempts to tackle such a sensitive issue as the suffering (also known as `passion') and crucifixion of the Son of God is bound to stir up tremendous controversy.  Mel Gibson certainly did that with his decision to tell the story of ""The Passion of the Christ"".  ""The Passion"" was slammed in Jewish circles for being anti-Semitic and slammed in many other circles for being overly violent.  The outcry was so great that Gibson was forced to distribute this film on his own because no major studio would touch it.  The controversy, itself, is mostly without justification.  The fears of the film being anti-Semitic are unfounded.  The movie does not condemn Jewish people for the actions of a few of their priests (Caiphas, most notably) in the death of Christ anymore than it condemns the Roman people for Pontius Pilate's weak and indecisive role in the crucifixion.  It's the priests are to be condemned for their petty fearfulness.  The Jewish people are shown to be quite sorrowful over the torture and death of Christ.  The story, itself, is core to the origins of Catholic and Christian faith.  Its existence is canon.  Only misinterpretations in telling the story can cause ill will.  ""The Passion"" is derived almost completely from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Thus, it avoids that mistake.The criticisms pertaining to the overt violence of the film, while not baseless, are overstated.  There is no doubt that ""The Passion"" is an extremely violent film and certainly not suitable for young children or faint of heart.  However, there is nothing gratuitous or sensational about the violence.  The scene of the scourging of Christ is one of the most difficult to sit through, but it is honest in its depiction of the brutality of the centurions of the Roman Empire.  The graphic violence, torture and beatings are necessary so that the audience can truly empathize (and even sympathize) with the suffering Christ went through for our sins.Controversy notwithstanding, ""The Passion"" is amazing in its story structure and imagery.  While primarily telling of the last twelve hours (events known to Christians the Stations of the Cross and a time known as Good Friday), Gibson uses small visual cues to segue into flashbacks of Jesus' life, thereby increasing the impact of the crucifixion by increasing the understanding of the greatness of this man.  Such events as the Last Supper, the drawing of the line in the sand to protect Mary Magdelene, and the famous Sermon on the Mount are shown with such touching detail that audience feels deeply for this man.  Even chorological events like Judas' betrayal of Jesus and Peter's denial of Jesus three times are emotionally gripping.While the scourging may be the most brutal aspect of the film, the events after Christ is put on the cross at Calvary are the most heart-wrenching.  Actor Jim Caviezel does a spectacular job of embracing Christ's suffering while still showing his goodness and caring for others.  When Jesus speaks to the good thief, one can feel overwhelmed.  The other performances in this film are equally as stunning as Caviezel's.  Maia Morgenstern captures the grief a mother feels as Mary watches her only son be put to death.  The luminous Monica Bellucci also shows tremendous emotion as Magdelene, a woman who owes her life to the benevolence of Christ, yet is powerless to help him.  Even Bulgarian actor Hristo Shopov effectively captures the conflict and indecision of Pilate.""The Passion of The Christ"" is as astounding a cinematic achievement as has ever been brought to the big screen.  It has been over a month since I saw it and it still dominates my thoughts.  I said that no one who sees this film will ever been same afterwards.  I know that I feel changed."	5.0	A remarkable a telling of an amazing story	2004-04-22	9	6	3

What Mel Gibson  brought, though, is immeasurable !  Why ? Because the only part in Jesus of Nazareth that was very good but could have gone deeper, in terms of realness, was the last days. Not because Zefirelli could have done better but more because now we are so use to violence that the end of Jesus of Nazareth doesn't touch us as much as it did. Many suggest that it is only a violent movie. It is true that if you can't very gently let it pierce you as you experience such pain, this movie is not for you yet, it wouldn't help anything.

After seeing this movie, I cannot figure out what the hub-bub was all about.  If you look at the movie from a technical standpoint, then you will not be disappointed.  The cinematography was good, the acting was excellent, and the special effects were top-notch (this last point is especially true.  I feel that the gruesome and vicious portrayal of Jesus' torture was done in a manner that aesthetically tasteful and not done just to ""gross everybody out"").  If you look at this movie from a religious standpoint, again, you will not be disappointed.  I am not an overly religious individual, but I was very moved by the portrait of Christ's last 12 hours.

As a fairly new Christian, seeing this movie put into perspective just what my sins REALLY mean. It's probably not the best for someone with a weak stomach though - there are some pretty violent scenes. But, if you want to understand what it meant for Jesus to die for your sins, this is a great movie to watch.My only issue with the movie was that the characters don't speak English. They speak Latin. The good/bad news is that there are subtitles so that you know what they are saying, but it is a bit annoying to have to read so many subtitles during the movie. But, that's not that big a deal, there aren't enough to make you miss what's going on.Overall a great movie though. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is a born-again Christian or even to someone who isn't but is curious about Jesus's crucifixion.	4.0	Gets the point across well	2011-05-19	3	0	3

I had read so much and heard so much about it, but when I saw it, I was moved beyond words. I was shaken from my complacency and was made uncomfortable, and rightly so. For I had neglected to realize all that our Lord Jesus willingly suffered. And I did suffer during the movie, at least in some small way sharing in his suffering. I felt so unworthy of his love, but yet so grateful.

Jackson ""Paul Jackson"""	"I think this film is similar in style to a lot of films in recent years that depict historic events with shocking realism.  The first example that comes to mind is the landing scene in Saving Private Ryan.I'm not an expert in the Gospels - I probably have less than 5% of it memorized.  All the lines I was expecting to see were there.  The last supper is included, but not in the way I would have liked.  I would prefer to have seen it laid out in a way that depicted his sacrifice as a Passover sacrifice, however, you can't tell from the movie that this takes place during Passover.I didn't notice too much stuff that seemed non-biblical, except I don't recall any references to Satan being present during the passion.  I think it was a reasonable thing to show, however.Lastly, as far as the whole anti-Semitic debate, I read Matthew 27 before seeing the movie.  (Matthew, by the way, is regarded as being the 1 of the 4 gospels specifically targeting a Jewish audience.)  The movie includes verse 24 (When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all, but that a riot was breaking out instead, he took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying, ""I am innocent of this man's blood. Look to it yourselves."") including subtitles, but did not include verse 25 (And the whole people said in reply, ""His blood be upon us and upon our children."").  So, is it anti-Semitic?  Draw your own conclusion.  I would submit that the Gospel according to Matthew is more anti-Semitic, which ever way you choose to judge this movie.Also, someone told me they were worried about fanatical Christians freaking out during the middle of the movie.  You couldn't tell by looking at the audience whether you were going to see The Passion or The Lord of the Rings.  If anything, this audience was better-behaved.As far a being spiritual, I agree with other reviews that it depends upon your predisposition.  You do not learn any theology watching the movie.  It did, however, stir my emotions, and I think this movie would have that affect on most anybody."	4.0	Modern Depiction of the Crucifixion	2004-02-25	2	2	0

If one really wants to feel sorrow for their sins, watching the passion is a good step.I've never seen such a realistic, brutal, and bloody account of the passion. Gibson's The Passion is the standard to which I measure all other accounts of Jesus' passion.I would reccomend this movie to anyone over the age of 11 (depending on the maturity of the person). The Passion of The Christ is a movie that all Christians should see in order to see the reality of their faith. Jesus wasn't just some nice passive hippy dude, he really suffered and really died.	5.0	Reality Check	2014-04-16	0	0	0

As a Christian, in my opinion, every believer needs to watch this harsh, violent display of Christ's absolute love for mankind. I think it is a must, and I will watch this yearly now as a reminder of God's extreme sacrifice for His children.	5.0	The Passion	2014-03-19	1	0	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3TLX5CLH7NEL1	Paul Dsouza	Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly, I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal, some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church, some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes, it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives.	5.0	You need to own this	2007-11-15	5	4	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1A4URTS77JHWN	Paul Frandano	"Forget the story behind the camera and focus on what Mel Gibson has put on the screen.Churlish reviewers have refused even to grant that Mel Gibson's filmed ""stations of the Cross"" is a powerful work of cinematic art. When you ask yourself ""who is the true auteur?"" of a film, you can argue about the director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer. Gibson gets a hat-trick (he didn't shoot the picture, but I'll bet he framed a something in every scene) and, as producer, hired the brilliant Caleb Deschanel to do the shoot. (I particularly appreciate Deschanel's visual quotations from art history -- Caravaggio's chiaroscuro lighting, Gr&uuml;newald's stark brutalism, Bosch's nightmarishly learning faces, and more.) This is a very bold, very imaginative, very powerfully realized conception of the passion of Jesus. If you think Gibson is less than just a pretty face -- and and I am NOT a fan of his movie performances -- you are, in my estimation, dead wrong. He's an impressive filmmaker.This is also a very Catholic film, and a very Isenheim Altarpiece perspective on Catholic belief, which is: you cannot walk away from the power of the suffering servant's sacrifice that the Church teaches and depicts in the crucifix, which dominates the nave of every Catholic sanctuary. One of Gibson's goals was to remind viewers that the term ""excruciating"" comes from ""crucifixion."" Reviewers who have discussed The Passion's lack of affective power strike me as missing a sizable point: the ""Passion of Mary"" -- with Jesus's mother movingly portrayed by a Romanian Jew, Maia Morgenstern -- stays near the center of the narrative, as the Catholic Church's Mariology is near the center of its theology. In the crowded theater in which I viewed this picture, mothers, and particularly mothers with sons -- my wife included -- were shattered by some of the scenes of Mary's agony along the Via Dolorosa.I am neither Catholic, nor even Christian, nor am I Jewish. I don't have a religious stake in the anti-Semitism discussion. But I do in fact object to the portrait, on the screen, of the Jews and the Sanhedrin. I don't think Gibson's creation is intentionally anti-Semitic. I do believe, emphatically, that Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin are Jewish caricatures, who all look and sound like Tevye the Milkman, replete with guttural growls, who are attired, probably historically, in pompous ceremonial garb and, riding in slow caravan procession, astride their ridiculously tiny donkeys, noses in the air, bobbing up the road to Golgotha.This would be unobjectionable -- ""shouldn't we cast actors who will be believable as first-century Jews?"" -- if Jim Caviezel's Jesus, also a Jew, were not, before being pummeled into utter disfigurement, a sparkle-smiled, ripped fashion-model Messiah with a classically chiseled GQ profile -- his trainer gets a nice end-credit. And when the earthquake comes and the Temple is rent in twain and the Jewish leaders, now believing their actions have displeased the Lord, are thrown into confusion, we are to believe, as the New Testament accounts would also have us believe, that the Jesus's persecutors are reaping their just deserts. (And I do worry about the incendiary potential of this picture, but that's backstory material that I won't go into is a discussion of the film's merits.)Finally, it is very, very violent. ""Pornographic""? No. The times were cruel, and the Romans didn't conquer and preserve an empire by waiting for an invitation or holding pinky-in-the-air tea parties. We go to movies to be taken to places we can no longer get to except through acts of imagination: 1st century Palestine is one such place. Attitudes toward cruelty have changed dramatically even in the last century -- many who read this will remember corporal punishment in elementary school, or routine unkindnesses that were heaped upon the bearer of any difference (facial features, disfigurements, handicaps, mental problems, etc.). We tend now to wince in the face of the terrible -- a learned reaction, bred into us by ""civilization."" This movie places the terrible directly in your face.See The Passion and judge for yourself. Trust no opinion. For me, although this is the most familiar story in the world, it is nevertheless compelling as film, and, although some critics have said this is only for ""true believers,"" I would agree if we qualified that to mean: ""true believers in the power of film to transport, to stir, to confront, to anger, to inspire, to disturb."" And everyone else is going to have a view, whether they've seen it or not: wouldn't you rather have a well-formed opinion?"	4.0	Powerful Cinema, But . . .	2004-03-02	17	13	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2560P170IVMG8	Paul Green	but you can't take Hollywood out of GibsonSurrounded by controversy it came as quite a surprise to find out just how ordinary this film really is.  Certainly the violence is distressing and there are a couple of beautifully acted and moving moments. In many ways I'd have liked to be able to say that this is a good film, but I can'tSo what is wrong with this film?  Well, Mel Gibson.  Although there is no doubting his sincerity in making this film it does demonstrate his limitations as an artist. His decision to have the film subtitled demonstrates his striving for authenticity; so, how to explain the 'Golden Turkey Awards'esque moment where Mary and he laugh about the table he has built or the addition of a few hissing demons to spice up the non violent moments?  He also wants us to know who is GOOD and who is BAD.  There is no room for moral ambiguity in this film; hence, Pilate, a victim of political machinations and Herod, a laughably sybaritic decadent who is obviously a BAD man.By the end of the film I felt bludgeoned; not by the violence, but by the stereotypes that Gibson parades for our entertainment and by his desire to make sure that this is a Hollywood film despite all of its pretentions to being ART	2.0	You can take Gibson out of Hollywood....	2004-11-10	20	10	10

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A13HL43DGTCCN0	Paul J. Goetke	The movie for me was very hard to watch and left me in tears. What upsets me is the immediate outpouring of hurt feelings, people complaining it was antisemitic. The fact is, neither the Romans nor the Jews killed Christ. He willingly gave up His life, to save a lost world. He could have stopped it at any point but was determined to do the will of the Father. If blame is to be placed, it is to be placed squarely on every one of our shoulders. Jesus gave up His life so that we may have eternal life. Every sin great or small made the crucifixion necessary and even if only one person had accepted Christ as their savior, He would have still done it. As for the Jews; they are still God's chosen people and have a great role to play in the end times. I apologize if this was not so much a review as an attempt for people to see what the film was really about. Despite director Mel Gibson's recent behavior, I believe the film, coupled with his behavior points out that we are ALL sinners and in need of the salvation provided on the cross and more importantly by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.	5.0	Controvery over fik simply highlights common misunderstanding of the Crucifixion	2011-08-02	5	4	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1HHVJCCAQMLAM	"Paul Krueger ""tkdcompdude"""	I am a regular attending Catholic every week unless something comes up. I saw this movie in the theaters on Easter Sunday orginally planned for Good Friday. Yes this movie is grusome and sad. But this is what Jesus has done for us Christians. It is very powerful, I admit I had to look away at some points because it was to much for me. It made me feel stronger in my beliefs in him. I have read reviews of this movie all over the web. This movie is not for children. Though I do strongly believe that this movie is true to what happened. Yeah the last 12 hours of his life were not pretty but he did that for us. He knew that too. I just strongly believe that this movie well have a specail place in my memory due to seeing it on that Sunday. Believe what you want but this is what I believe in, if your anything else I still support you but I just don't believe in the same things as you do. But that is what makes religion so amazing, it is diverse. So for the people that gave negatives, I don't understand. If your giving negatives because it is too grusome, will I unfortunately believe this is the way the dealt with people in those days. I can just remember this story every Easter, or even Lent. Sometimes makes me cry and makes me thank the higher power for what they have given to me in my life. I have brothers, sisters, grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, parents, and etc. I am also thankful for all of the gifts I have been given and all of my challenges I have had in life because this allows me to grow as a person.So people please just bare in mind, Jesus knew what he was doing for us(christains) and if he didn't would the christian religion exsist? There is one thing to note Jesus was correct in, that there would be opposition in that area, what do you know history shows this happened.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AXRXN0M0GO745	Paul Soucy	Review:  I've sat around now for an hour trying to figure out a way to put into words some sophisticated way of articulating my thoughts on The Passion of The Christ to absolutely no avail.  I mean if there was ever a time where I'm at a loss for words, it would be after seeing this film.  It is absolutely the hardest, most challenging and moving film I have ever seen.  I probably feel this in part because I am a born again Christian who cannot separate the Spirit of God from myself like it is some attachment or burdening accessory I need to be rid of.  God's spirit is a part of my very nature, the very core of who I am as a person.  My attempt to put this very part of who I am aside to view this film was utterly futile.  All hour before the film started I sat in my seat trying to build up some sort of emotional resistance so I could get through this film aloof and critical.  But the first time they hit my Christ, that was it.  I could no longer be a hypocrite and try to view it from a critical perspective anymore because now it was striking something deeply personal in me, something that is at the core of my being.  That is, that Christ who was God in the flesh suffered immense humiliation, persecution, and pain for me through his death because I am in fact a horrible sinner.In absolute detail Mel Gibson relentlessly challenges the viewer with this very fact by focusing mainly on the last hours of Jesus.  This is after all the thrust of the Christian message.  Take it or leave it.  We are witness to his capture, illegal trial, beating, flogging and crucifixion, all in painstaking vivid, bloody detail.  Two scenes will forever be etched into my mind the next time I read the Gospels.  One is the flogging, the other scene being when the nails are driven into Christ's hands as he cries out for His aggressors souls.  The cross was a symbol of execution, and humiliation.  How signifigant that God endured ruthless humiliation and pain on our behalf. This is why it is so important to believe and not reject what God has offered us.  There are points while Christ is being flogged that you can hear his floggers mocking him and ridiculing Him.  There He is, The Creator of the Universe being spit on and mocked as though He was scum off the bottom of a sandle.  For the first time ever you really get a sense of the anguish, and agony our Lord suffered.Gibson has brought the horror and violent and humiliating magnitude of the death of Christ to our eyes in a way no other film has even gotten close to achieving.  Unflinching, and unrelenting it is a brazen, beautiful, and bold retelling of  the most important event in history.  Everyone should experience this film one to see what all the fuss is about but also to readily be put face to face with what Christ did for all everywhere through His great love.  It certainly left me with much to think about in regards to my faith, about life in general and many other things.  These are of course the marks of a really great film. Great films challenge you and move you to different places than you were before.  The Passion of the Christ is a masterpiece and absolutely moved me to a different place.  I found it very moving, saddening, triumphant, dramatic, exciting, and inspiring to say the least; and I'm sure each and every person that experiences it will come away with an entirely personal account of their own.  By all means I implore everyone to please see this film, experience in vivid bold challenging detail the great love Christ had for all, The Passion of the Christ.	5.0	Challenging, brazen, bold, and beautiful - THE REAL DEAL	2004-02-26	5	4	1

There is no middle ground for those who view this film.As the many reviews suggest, there is stark division between those who are deeply moved by the love Christ showed for mankind by enduring His Passion, and those who make a mockery of it: just like those who surrounded Jesus as He hung on the cross.  Jesus prophecied that ""When I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto myself.""  This is certainly true: ""all men,"" those who seek to comfort Christ in His profound, redemptive suffering; and those who choose only to intensify it.I am deeply grateful for the honest, Roman Catholic witness of this film to the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the God-Man.

Because, after all, Christ did this for me. I thought the scene in the Garden of Gethsemane was visually stunning. The movie grabbed my attention from the very start and I was absorbed. As far as crying, I cried right after Peter and Jesus locked eyes after Peter denied him three times. Peter was heart-broken, a very powerful scene. I cried at the magnitude of the scourging. I thought back that this is the way it could have been, maybe more, maybe less. I cried when Mary had a flashback to the boy Jesus when he fell and hurt himself. She ran to comfort him. Then she ran to comfort him as he fell with the cross. She seemed to give him strength to carry on. Jesus' words to his mother, ""Mother, watch me as I make all things new"", gave me chills. I thought the climatic scence was when the tear fell from heaven and struck the ground after Jesus died on the cross. I couldn't help it, I cried with God.No movie, I mean none, has ever affected me this emotionally, ever. The Jesus of Nazerath TV mini-series did a little, but nothing like The Passion of the Christ. Mel Gibson has created a classic. I'm sure they will be talking about this movie 100 years from now.These questions were posed to me by a friend. Here are my answers.Q. Who or what was the baby that Satan was holding while Jesus was being scourged? A. After the scourging, Satan holds a grotesque child in mockery of the old Adam, and also of Mary's eventual piet&agrave; (i.e., a painting or sculpture of the Virgin Mary holding and mourning over the dead body of Jesus).Q.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3EVUKZ3TZL726	"Person ""A Customer"""	This movie is one big Christian guilt trip. Mel Gibson obviously doesn't know anything about what Jesus would want. It's my firm belief that Jesus doesn't want us to watch him get brutally murdered, he wants us to see a movie that talks about what he teaches and how it's important.I believe in God and Jesus, but I don't want to watch my savior get tortured for two hours. And for parents who bring their kids to see this movie . . . go to hell. This is not a kid's movie. It isn't that important that you should freak the crap out of your kids. I've seen kids that have seen this movie and it disturbs them greatly, as well as it should. One of the worst cases is of this crazy couple that took their autistic kid to see the 'Passion' and now that kid thinks that he's going to go to Hell. So, take that into consideration, it's R for a reason.So, remember, this is not the most important film ever made, because films are never important. It isn't fun and movies were made to be fun. That is the point. And another thing do not buy the 'Passion' merchandise. People should not be able to merchandise Jesus like this. And who really wants a necklace of a nail that was put in Jesus's hand.Mel Gibson if you actually cared about Christianity you'd give all the money you made off of the 'Passion', and I mean ALL of it and give it to a charity or two.	1.0	The Guilt Trip of the Mel Gibson	2004-07-04	56	21	35

People come up with the most ridiculous bones to pick with this movie; it's ""porno violence"", it's sexist because Satan is portrayed as a woman(actually much more of an androgynous figure, so ignore this moronic quibble when you see it), it's ""unfocused"". The real problem for many of these critics is that it's a blockbuster movie about Jesus Christ and that's just not a valid subject for serious ""cinema"". Anti Semitic? Absolutely not; if anything the film portrays Judas and Peter as the biggest jerks in the story, and people aren't so stupid as to become racists and bigots from viewing a Hollywood picture, thank you very much. Overly violent? It's a film about THE LAST TWELVE HOURS OF CHRIST'S LIFE! What do you think you're going to get? If graphic violence is ""gritty"", ""hip"" or ""brilliant"" in a Tarantino movie it's just as valid here for my money. Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for his guts and vision in putting his own money where his mouth is in order to maintain the artistic integrity of his project. This isn't ""Bad Boys"", ""Charlie's Angels"" or ""Dirty Dancing"" here folks, and we should be grateful that there is a filmmaker in Hollywood who still produces work of this caliber.Okay, now that I've vented, the acting is top notch, from the brilliant Jim Caviezel through the sadistic Roman soldiers, the photography is lush, the score is great, and it passes the real litmus test: you absolutely will not find your thoughts drifting to your grocery shopping, laundry, annoying co-workers, or anything else while viewing this film.

Fine performances all around, although I thought Herod was played a bit over the top.  I was actually surprised how much MOVIE there was in this movie, particularly since some professional reviewers called it wall-to-wall violence.  That is just flat out false.As scripture my mother found that it left out a few things but not much.  She stated bluntly that nobody who has read the bible should be surprised at the violence.As the media phenom that is has become, there was less violence then I expected.  As an experience for a Christian, you will cry and reflect. It is a powerful teaching tool you will not look at a crucifix the same way again.  If you don't believe, frankly you will likely miss the point, which is simply that someone who didn't have to suffered for the souls of the people who killed him.  If you don't buy that then this movie won't likely sell it to you however if you are wondering it might put you in the right direction.My final thought is for those that have vilified Gibson, and this movie, those who have done they best to stop it; ""foolish to make a movie in dead languages"", ""anti-Semitic"", ""too violent"", ""not historically accurate"" etc..."	5.0	Just what my mother expected	2004-02-25	1	0	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A28F4O0ZUZ6IX	Peter S. Lunde	I waited a while to see The Passion of the Christ so that I could approach it fairly and without the shouting of the faithfull/unfaithfull clogging up my ears. Recently, I was amazed to read Roger Ebert's 4-star review, which stated it was a great film simply because Ebert believed in what he was seeing and the film depicted that. So, I got it, saw it, and, . . .not so fast Mr. Ebert.Let me take this thing apart from several angles. For production, the film was nicely shot and adequate, and overall, the shots of Jerusalem type surroundings were effective. But the entire film was very cramped, and the only drammatic sequences that worked well for me were the scenes with Pontious Pilate. The film uses a  broad brush of color and myst; this reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings, and I half expected Frodo and Golom to appear at any time. Its constant use of slow motion to accentuate the beatings and whippings was very distracting, and the usual heavenly music competed with memories of The Ten Commandments. From these perspectives, Jerusalem in the Kingdom of Heaven was a powerful and beautiful film, which also gave the city a memorable singularity and grace. I also rewatched Barrabas, an earlier epic that more creatively and poignantly tells and shows this story, and at least, with more interest.As Jesus, James Caviezel has a handsome and photogenic face; kind of a Charlton Heston replacement with chiseled, monumental features. (He was marvelous in The Thin Red Line.) He looks like those Jesus pictures that people expect to see in a minister's office. In this film, however, Caviezel is constantly looking either very focused and silent or very confused and silent. He says little, but apparently this means a lot. When he gets whipped and beaten, which is often, it hurts, and he shows it, as most of us would. When I sum up the character in total, however, I am left with a rather empty shell of a portrayal. For those who know this story, explanations aren't necessary, and this is all Gibson gives the viewer. All the other characters, including the Romans, fall into stereotypical grieving, brave Mary, hysterically grinning, laughing, and ponderoulsly cruel Romans, cunning and slithering Jewish prelates, mournfully sad looking apostles, and a devil who looks suspiciously like Marilyn Manson (with snakes). Only Judas and Pontious Pilate have particlular roles that intrigue and question, but Gibson is too in love with the blood of Jesus and the leering of others to let them have much screen time. I wasn't left with any conviction that these people were real or that the event was any more worthy than the millions murdered over the millenia.The script was written for the faithful. What does this mean? If you go into most medieval churches in Europe, you sill see the renditions of the Christ story by the great painting masters of their time; you see the suffering of Christ, the crucifiction of Christ, Christ carrying the cross, the Resurrection of Christ, and so on. This film is merely a modern extension of those themes, and nothing else. I wanted to come away from this film with a new feeling, an insight into this story, which is entirely based on belief and with no archeology or record to support it. Pasolini's St. Matthew film portrays a believable Jesus, Barrabas gives us an intellectual and epic story of a man's journey to belief, and even M. Scorcese's film asks questions about the life of Jesus. None of this is in this film, just blood, more blood, flayed flesh, and more blood. A medieval masterpiece.	1.0	Unbelievable Mess	2005-12-02	27	12	15
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3OWUXIP6YB0FK	Peter Turrone	Before this movie was released the secular media had a field day arguing that it was nothing more than a mindless gore fest.  Ironically, these are the same critics who are also known to praise other films that use murder, incest, drug abuse and rape as a form of mindless entertainment. Or, worse still, some critics are those who praised The Last Temptation of Christ which is neither historical or well-made. The real issue relates to the fact that this film provides a glimpse into the historical life of the Incarnate God who came into the world in order to reconcile us with the Eternal Father.  It is a film that is true to the life of Christ as can be gleaned from the Synpotic gospels and many non-Christian sources.  The crucifixion wasn't a tea party.  It was plain aweful because our sins are plain aweful.  This film was made to remind people that God isn't some abstract cosmic force hovering away in the some distant galaxy. He is the God-with-us who loved us so much that He was even willing to endure this terrible suffering so that we could be freed from the grip of the enemy and become adopted children of the Heavenly Father.	5.0	For God so loved the world	2005-06-18	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3E1DXZ7WQPPKK	"P. Flannigan ""fliznizzey"""	"Mel Gibson has exploited the most common story ever portrayed. At some points it seemed to be almost sado-masochistic on his part. Because of the subject matter people have taken it so sincerely they have even created a ""Passion of the Christ Gospel"". It is sad that people dwell so intensely on the death of a man whose life stood for love and peace. Jesus did not want to die, but he knew that he had to in order to make a point for all of the murderous, unloving cretins that could not love themselves or others. The saddest part is that the same sort of people are still killing him over and over..and now you can see it on DVD! I don't recall reading any of this gore in  the gospels albeit it is well known that the Romans were a blood thirsty culture. If people could just live their life with honest integrity Jesus would have never had to go through this in the first place. The acting is sincere and the movie itself is a valid portrayal of life in those very hard and confusing times. I only hope we don't have to see him murdered too many more times after this. Let's try to concentrate on what he did and said when he was alive!"	3.0	Hell Raiser Part Six	2004-09-21	13	5	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2S1TF4OD00K53	"P. G. Keller ""Packerfan75"""	"Nowhere else is the word 'hero' defined better than what our Lord Jesus Christ did for us. He knew no sin and led the perfect life. He dedicated his life to serving God the Father and mankind by God's will. He was and is perfect.But we can never be. Never again, will another walk upon the earth who is sinless, blameless and perfect as Jesus is. Jesus Christ, God's one and only beloved son, given as a sacrifice to redeem mankind and save us from ourselves. God's ultimate love offering given because He loves us so. Jesus came for exactly this, that we may be saved, have a new life more abundant here and eternal life with Him in God's kingdom. Yes, he taught us and lived as the living example of what we all should aspire to be, but also to do what none of us could not do for ourselves. Pay the debt for our sins.Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that gives us the most accurate recreation of the Lord's passion and suffering that has ever been seen. Combining the descriptions in the New Testament's gospels along with the Old Testament's prophecies of the Lord and the historical depictions of Roman punishment and torture devices, we're able to see what the Lord most likely really endured. No question, this film is brutal, but it must be. If not, we only take away the truth in order to make ourselves feel more comfortable. I've seen many a violent film in my time but I found myself cringing more here than any of those. Not because I've never seen worse but because this is what the Savior did for us. It should've been us taking the beatings, the floggings and the crucifixion. That was our punishment placed upon the holy and innocent Son of God.'The Passion' focuses on the last days of Jesus' life here on earth. From the opening, we find him on the Mount of Olives, as the sins of the world are being placed upon him. As the cold, hard reality of the pain and suffering that he is about to endure for a people by large that reject him. But his love and dedication to The Father being so great, he remains committed and fulfills his purpose. He allows himself to be unjustly arrested and convicted of a crime he did not commit. Then handed over to the Romans to be scourged, tortured and ultimately put to death for the love of The Father and every one of us who's sins he bore. As it is written, ""greater love has no man that he who lay down his life for his friends"".But all of this would be in vain and just be a sad story had he not risen from the grave. If He were He just a man with some crazy ideas. But He did rise and is Lord and friend to all His people, to all God's children, while extending His invitation to all those who would receive Him. But contrary to popular belief, we are not all God's children. We are all God's creations but not until we are born again by grace through faith, confession and repentance in the Lord Jesus Christ, are we God's children. Jesus said, ""unless we are born again, we cannot see the kingdom of God"", and ""I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father but by me"". And so it is. Our sins must be dealt with. And so they were, on the shoulders of the Lord when he died on the cross, shedding his precious blood for us.This movie brought people to question, who's to blame? Is it the Jews fault, or the Romans, or all of us? In a way, all three are true. We are all responsible. He paid the price for our sins, our debt. We all had a hand in it. But it was also the greatest demonstration of love ever shown. The Father's great love and the love of the Lord.Some complain that the film is too focused on the suffering and doesn't show the events leading up to this point, the miracles and the relationships. I understand that but theres only so much time to do it. There is a scene though, in a flashback, where Jesus is building a table and you see a playful sweetness between him and his mother Mary. It's touching and I wanted to see more of that but there are other films that give us more of His life. I recommend 'Jesus of Nazareth' in what I believe is the most compelling and accurate telling. But this film had to stay focused. It too had a mission and purpose. To bring us to face what God the Father and the Jesus Christ did for us. So we could face the reality of it and of ourselves and I believe it succeeds. Many peoples lives were changed with this movie. Many people came to believe and we're saved. Many saved had fallen away and recommitted their lives to the Lord. Others were inspired to reflect and give thanks for the wonderful gift given to us. I know I did. I loved the fact that it got people talking. It got people thinking and discussing. It was on the T.V. and in the papers. People who would never otherwise talk about Jesus were and many who would never go to see such a film did. It was a wonderful time and a credit to the film.The dvd gives us a lovely period looking picture. Lots of browns and muted colors to show the age and make it believable. The print is clean and virtually free of blemish. The audio and score are very good. The dialog is in ancient hebrew with subtitiles which gives it a serious realism and isn't distracting. A very satisfying disc.In closing, 'The Passion' is a wonderful film. It's an undenialble message that will force the viewer to take a stand on what they believe or don't believe. There is no middle ground. And that's a huge accomplishment for a film, to do what it did. Mel Gibson has become a very accomplished director and it all shows here. Many criticize him even to this day for comments he made while intoxicated. People have used it as a chance to bash him and this movie. But as Jesus said, ""let he who is without sin, cast the first stone"". We've all said and done things that weren't right and have no right to rake another over the coals for it. He's human after all, just like the rest of us and just as we wish to be forgiven for our own sins, we should forgive him. He made a wonderful film that I suggest anyone and everyone watch with the exception of small children as there is alot of blood and violence that'll no doubt be scary to them. Parents, please use discretion and view it first. Jesus offers his invitation for salvation to everyone from all cultures and beliefs. All are welcome and no one will be turned away. Please consider accepting while you can."	5.0	The Son of God shows us what love is.	2008-02-03	4	2	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A291P9NIT3QF4Y	"P. Graham ""PJ"""	"This movie wasn't about violence, drama, or dialogue.  It simply was a re-enactment of Jesus' sacrifice.  Non-Christians who don't know the ""Word of God"" will absolutely get lost in the story.  I know the scriptures, not Hebrew or Latin, and yet I still knew exactly what was being said as well as what was happening in the film.  We only received a small glimpse of Christ's suffering.  It was a gift to see as much of Christ's life as we did with this film.One should not view this film with the hopes of comparing it to other graphically violent films, but to see if Jesus' story was told accurately.  The venom that I read in some of the negative comments leads me to believe that someone one was moved more than they'd care to share and are left with have one of two options: 1. Change your life and follow Jesus or 2. Keep doing what you're doing and live a life feeling convicted because you know the truth and you are responsible for what you know.I'm not sure Mel Gibson realized the product that he was to turn out, but I know God knew.  Christians needed a reminder of what love truly means--where love originated and where we as Christians have to set the moral standard in a world where goodness seems to be fading fast.

Technically speaking it was a well-filmed and acted movie.  The fact that the dialog was in Aramaic and Latin gave the film historical atmosphere.  Having been exposed to the story of Jesus Christ as a child I did not find the story hard to follow.  However, I'd imagine someone not fully knowledgeable of the death of Jesus could take the Passion out of context.I would not rate the movie as entertaining or informative. The scenes of Jesus' torture and crucifixion I did not think were as macabre as many critics claimed it to be.  (Apparently, the critics have not watched any slasher films in the past 20 years!)It was without a doubt a testament to Mel Gibson's faith and I am sure the faithful were as equally moved.

"If one can accept the distortions of Herod and Pilate, and the depiction of the masses as bloodthirsty, sinister Jews willing to go against their own tradition of never supporting the execution a Rabbi then you have a compelling film, conveying the message that the ultimate Love is sacrifice and Jesus Of Nazareth willingly endured unimaginable pain so as to overcome it and cleanse and Save the Souls of all of those who believe in Him. Was his last days as, in today's lexicon, a ""hybrid"" Diety-Human more of an exhibition, even to the extent of asking his Father, ""Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?"". As God's Son, would he have the Power to miraculously avoid the suffering? A big question for this Reviewer.To the actual film: I think it would have worked better as a Play, even a Ballet. Has a very, staged, mechanical look to it. If Gibson really did reference Anne Emerich's writing (and possibly his own Father's insensitive comments about Jews today), then perhaps he was trying to teach or at least share with Christians *and* Jews, his personal take, albeit awkward, on the events of two thousand years ago.""Tough Love"" perhaps? The bludgeoning of the viewers senses with continuous corporeal beating of the man who represented Peace?But good intentions cannot surmount biased historical perspective: I submit that there were enough Jewish-Christians in the supposed angry masses to suppress the desires of a small minority who didn't understand the situation as a whole and *and* their own Peaceful tradition.Mel, ""The Year Of Living Dangerously"", ""Lethal Weapon(s)"", and ""Braveheart"" are your celluloid domain.

When Jesus was being torture by the romans, I felt like there are thousands of knifes stabbed into my heart. I truely believe that believers and non-believers felt the same way too. For myself, I am a catholic, and the contents of the movie are close to what the bible had mentioned. Some people said that the contents of the movie are too violent(when jesus was tortured by the romans), but I think is true. Because at that time, the romans are barbaric and violent under Caeser's empire, and that's how they conquered half of the world at that time, if someone had watch the movie (""Gladiator"" directed by Scott Riley)will understand that too. In the movie, the appearance of satan had also differentiate the forces of good and evil. Satan's goal is to build up the hatred between men, and Jesus is to stop Satan's plan. Jesus said to his 12 disciples, to love your enemy and to forgive them. He told God to forgive the people that tortured/hated him when he was crucified. On Feb 25,2004-I remember what the critics said on television, this movie had built up the hatred between the Christian community and the Jewish community.

The direction is nice, the visual and special effects are artful and the acting is adequate. However, as soon as the movie begins to show the lashing of Jesus, it dwindles into an overblown sado-masochist fantasy. I know the bible and the time period well, and there is absolutely zero reason to believe that this is a realistic depiction of how the christ was tortured, Yes, he was tortured, but The Passion shows Jesus enduring treatment that would have killed any living creature within the first ten minutes. You could see Jesus's ribs, for God's sake!During and after the flogging, the worst that can happen does. I began counting the lashes, but lost count after 80-something, which is more than double what the Bible states Jesus was given. PLus, every time the man falls while carrying his cross, the cross falls on his back or he falls onto a sharp rock-any living creature would have long been dead, but Gibson carried it out for shock value. What could have been dramatic effect if used sparingly became an orgiastic festival of gore and violence.In the hands of an unbiased director, this would have been one of the best films I've seen in years, but Gibson let his own passion blind him. I could practically hear Mel offscreen yelling, ""Yes! More blood! More! MORE!!!""Still, those who want to believe this is ""realistic"" will do so regardless of reality.

From the very first scene, I found it helpful to turn my critical mind off, and let the tapestry be woven before my eyes as if I knew nothing of the story.  Of course, everyone knows the basic story of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  Gibson's film, however, unfolds like a timeless moment, told with emotional images - not words - that earnestly recreate the physical events and spiritual dimensions of that most fateful of all days.  One is awe-struck by the dignity of the Lord in the face of such savagery.  Caviezel's performance is nothing short of miraculous.  Yes - the brutality is raw, vivid, but necessary.  To soft-pedal the passion is to lessen His sacrifice and minimize the reason for His suffering.  WE are the reason for this suffering.  What more, as a demonstration of His love for you and for me, could our Lord have done?  Our reaction to this message of divine love, and whether we choose to accept His invitation, or not, is what this sublime film is all about.Gibson has created a film for our time, and for generations to come, the world over.  The influence of 'The Passion' will be far-reaching and difficult to fathom, especially now, when the light of religious freedom is, finally, dawning on formerly dark corners of this world.	5.0	Visual Poetry	2004-04-14	6	4	2

Here's why:1) It's almost exactly like I thought it would be. Most of us know the story already, so there's no real surprises. I definitly must say this: leave the kids at home. It is graphic and brutal and by no means should children be watching it. I mean they beat the living crud out of him. It was actually to the point of my saying ""come ON. He would be dead by now."" And HE'S THE SON OF GOD.2) I was looking for some spirituality in this. It is dry of it, and the only emotion is from the cringes we get from the constant beating. It was almost like a documentary with a high budget. This movie will not win any new converts. While those who already believe may get emotional by having the scene presented to them, I don't see it going beyond that.3) This whole silly anti-semetic controversy will finally be laid to rest. It is not in any way, shape, or form.4) I felt like Gibson was trying to punish us. We must watch the torture of Jesus to atone for our own sins. The problem is he went about it the wrong way.5) GREAT acting. GREAT scenes. Still... it's missing that oomph."	2.0	Sadistic and empty of Spirituality	2004-02-24	303	97	206

And they had the women that was close to JESUS as nuns, which is totally a lie!!!! They were Jewish!!!!!  I forgot the 3 other points this asked me to speak on.They Only 1 thing I will mention is the movies in the pass never made it look like JESUS WAS BRUTLY beaten, just a swipe of red dye/ or paint here and there!!!!! Nobody could not take serious the EXCURCIATING  BEATEN THAT JESUS CHRIST WENT THROUGH FOR Us sinful human beings!!!! This is one movie no matter how gruesome it was, that portrayed the most likely beating JESUS CHRIST RECEIVED!!!!  How can we come to this conclusion? The Romans were very well known for their brutality  and the Jewish Leaders[priest ] wanted JESUS TO SUFFER and DIE BECAUSE HE DECLARE HIMSELF AS THE &#34; I AM&#34; !!! HE WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE JESUS CHRIST THE SON-GOD,  THE HOLY SPIRIT- GOD, AND THE FATHER-GOD = THE ALMIGHTY GODHEAD!!!  and I think us human beings take it very lightly What JESUS ENDURED For US!!!!So I gave it a 3 rating because of the lies that were in the movie!!!! IF There would not been so many lies, I would have given it a 5 for THE REALISM OF THE BEATEN JESUS RECEIVED AND HE DID NOT DESERVE 1 LASH !!! And I PRAY MANY PEOPLE WORLD WIDE  GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, SO THEY REALIZE WHAT JESUS ENDURED AND PAID THE PRICE For Our sins so we may be FORGIVEN, IF We REPENT AND GIVE Our Hearts and Lives TO THE ALMIGHTY GODHEAD AND FOLLOW THEIR HOLY WORS -THE HOLY BIBLE!!!!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1YZ9CA3NW99C0	Pompey Scipio 'the lesser'	There are several reasons why I wanted to see this movie in the theatre and why I got the DVD when it first came out. Here are the most important reasons...Firstly, I read somewhere about a saint (could be the Fatima Saint Lucia Santos) saying that Christ was upset over the fact that no one on Earth reads his passion and death in the Gospels anymore--or atleast the majority of people on Earth don't pay great deal of attention to it.  So I kind of believe that Jesus had a hand in making this film--no matter if Mel Gibson knew about it or not.Secondly, I think I've read somewhere that Mel Gibson thought depressing thoughts during the time that he was making Braveheart (or atleast before or after that time), and that the only thing that got him through life was reading the passion of Jesus.Thirdly, there is supposed to be a town in Germany that, during the middle ages, was almost on the verge of contracting the plague, but the residents of this town decided to ask God to not allow the plague to come to them if they decided to put on the play of his son's passion and death from then onwards.  I think they are still putting on this play to this day, and the plague never came to their town.This movie is great.  It had everything that I expected from a clean cut movie depicting the brutality that the enemies of Christ inflicted upon Christ himself.  It shows how much Christ loved the Universe by sacrificing himself for all of us.  This movie shows a perfect dignity and respect to Jesus and his Apostles, unlike the perfomances shown in the movie: Jesus of Nazareth--although this last movie made in the late '70s is not so bad either.  Three cheers for the Father,  the Son, and the Holy Spirit and congratulations to Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel !!!	5.0	Great movie on Christ, the ruler of the Universe	2004-11-21	11	8	3

The story line, the violence, the betrayal, and the emotions are all very real to the point of disbelief.  There is no way a person cannot take this movie personally, whether they are a believer or non-believer. I'm a Christian myself and it was very hard to keep myself together while watching this movie.  The way that Mel Gibson portrayed history through this movie was magnificent.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2Y9KFFREXTS3Z	Poor Yorick	"Gibson is not quite the serious individual he makes himself out to be in his second feature as director.  We all know that the man is very funny and that, for whatever reasons, he decided to edit out all humorous content from his depiction of Jesus.In one version of the script, Gibson was rumored to begin the film with a wild party sequence in which Jesus converts water into wine and manages to get all of the guests at the wedding reception plastered.  The scene ends in an outrageous pie fight with Jesus egging on the Pharisees who are obviously scandalized by such irreverent behavior (the Gnostic gospels tell us that the Pharisees loved cream pie almost as much as they loved the Torah and so saw Jesus's ""miracle"" as an act of blasphemy).Another version of the script, apparently inspired by some of the Gnostic gospels, shows Jesus as a small boy playing pranks on his elders, turning them into goats and sheep and then watching as shepherds whip them into submission.  All of this is prologue, of course, to the final version of the film, but it does suggest that, in Gibson's opinion, Jesus richly deserved what he got in the end.The choice of Aramaic was a last minute edition as well.  Originally, the film was done in Yiddish with Jesus shouting, ""Oy, my schmeckel!"" in a deleted scene with Mary Magdalene.  We can only hope that Gibson will release a director's cut of the film with a commentary track with some of those funny Left Behind people."	2.0	In Need of a Laugh Track	2007-02-07	7	1	6

I heard much controversey about this movie before it came out, but it was my heart that brought me to see it not the controversey. I also wanted to support Mel Gibson who raised his own 25 million dollars to make this movie because no one in Hollywood would dare back him up. No need to feel sorry for Mel though, because now this movie has made over 200 million dollars as I write this and is the #1 movie in America two weeks in a row. I knew that with the most famous man in the world (Jesus Christ) that this was going to be a movie that was going to create much dialogue. Never in my life have I been so touched by a movie like I was with this one. The strange thing was that even though this movie was not filmed in english, the story about Jesus was something that crossed language barriers across the world. When you see what Jesus went through in this film it just pulls at your heart and makes you appreciate what Jesus did for us all. This is a graphic movie but what would you expect from a crucifixion. One of the many touching moments of this film is when the drop of water from heaven falls when Jesus died I felt it was God the father crying for giving his son to cleanse us for all our sins. James Caviezel (who playes Jesus in the movie) did a truly amazing job and I truly believe God was shining through this actor. I believe no one could have played Jesus like this man did, and this was the role he was born to play. I would just like to point out James also did a wonderful job as The Count in ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"". Some people said no ordinary man would be able to continue living through this torture, but James Caviezel pointed out in an interview Jesus Christ is no ordinary human being. The Passion of The Christ will inspire you and touch your heart like few movies can, but most importantly if your a believer it will stay with you the rest of your life!"	5.0	The Passion of  the Christ is a beautiful work of art	2004-03-08	9	5	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ADUD2B1M768W2	Prof Positive	I rented this movie undeterred by the negative reviews regarding too much violence that I had heard from friends. After all, I thought depictions of graphic violence would help illustrate how horrible the crucifixion was. Unfortunately graphic violence alone isn't enough to give this movie the emotional impact that the subject deserves.The audience goes into this movie with knowledge of who and what Jesus is. For this reason Mel Gibson apparently thought that no character establishing scenes were necessary. All we learn from this movie is that Jesus was a guy who suffered a lot. In fact the ultra-violence actually made the crucifixion seem less agonizing to me. I couldn't help but think that after losing about 3 gallons of blood (based on the large pools left on the ground after he was flogged) and the beatings he took about the head, that Jesus would have been too far gone by the time he was nailed to the cross to feel much pain. The few, brief scenes which didn't involve Jesus' torture were mostly uninspired clips of events which occurred in the days prior to the crucifixion. These are scenes that those who have read the bible are all too familiar with, and the dull, monotone delivery by the actors does nothing to bring these scenes to life. The scenes of Satan and demonic children throughout the movie seem random and silly. How the writers and director could do so little with such a great story bewilders me.A far more moving movie is Jesus of Nazareth. The only objection I have heard about Jesus of Nazareth is that Jesus is played by a non-Jew with blue eyes. If you can't get over that then you will be depriving yourself of seeing a movie about Jesus that delivers far more insight into what a wise, charismatic, and loving entity Jesus was. Brilliant performances combined with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack make the crucifixion scenes in Jesus of Nazareth carry far more emotion impact than the passion of the Christ did.	1.0	no emotional impact despite graphic violence	2004-09-24	105	55	50
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2LK0NTS9XA8N6	"ProgMan ""prog_man"""	"... The Movie Was Great!  The story is one almost everyone knows, at least to some degree.  It is based on the Gospel accounts of the last 12 hours, or so, of Jesus' life.  There was a fair ammount of poetic license taken with the ""Satan"" character.  However, if you also recall, or take time to read other scripture, you will find that Satan tried to seduce Jesus by offering him all the kingdoms of the world and riches, etc.  So, it is not an unreasonable assumption to think that Satan would be very interested in the last hours of Jesus' life.  In the words of Emperor Palpatine: ""If he could be turned, he would be a valuable asset.""  Anyway, that is of course if you believe in God, Christ, and Satan.Now as for the faithfulness to the scripture, I am not a biblical scholar, however I did attend parochial school for a very long time (too long in my opinion).  And as far as I can remember, the story is right on.  A+ and Big Props to Mel for being very faithful to the Gospel story.  The use of Aramaic and Latin was absolutely awesome.  It added a sense of ""pseudo-reality"" to the movie.  And, it was very refreshing to hear the Roman soldiers and officials NOT speaking with a British accent; i.e. I CLAUDIUS and even Gladiator, A+ Mel.The sets and costumes were excellent.  I am not an archeologist or antiquarian, but I do know some about Roman and Biblical history and there were no glaring errors in costuming.  I actually thought the Romans were very accurate.  I'm not sure if they filmed it on location but the sets were really what one would expect Jerusalem of 30BCE to look like.The torture was exactly that: TORTURE!  This was the first accounting of The Passion which actually emparted the sense of suffering onto the audience.  I've been to church ceremonies where the only sense of suffereing you get is from the dull pain in your knees from  kneeling.  This movie made the people in comfortable seats writhe as if they were being scourged.  And to those of you who think its too gorey: it's a ROMAN FLOGGING and CRUCIFIXION.  You didn't buy a ticket to see Frosty the Snowman, or even Charleton Heston in Ben Hur. It's not supposed to be soft, cozy and cuddly.  It's harsh, gruesome, inhumane, and disgusting.  And, people actually did that to one another and still do worse today!  Deal With It!  And, A+ to Mel for making the audience suffer through the flogging.  If nothing else Mel made the point that this isn't supposed to be fun.One complaint: it looks like Jesus lost so much blood that he should have passed out by the time he starts carrying the cross.  But that's probably just too much leeway with the blood and makeup effects people.All in all, A+, great effort and worth the time and money if you are interested in seeing how one of the most influential historical figures of our world spent his last hours and gained such a high place of stature in western society."	5.0	worth being passionate over	2004-02-29	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2G151QE16KTID	ProgMonkey	"This is an incredible movie. Like many other reviewers, i agree that it is most certainly not one of those movies you go to see and just say ""Wow, that was interesting"". It was an experience. I'm Jewish, and I would like to say that there was almost no anti-Semitism in the movie, despite what people think. It is a deeply moving and deeply horrifying depiction of the last 12 hours of Christ's life. I am not religious at all, not in any way, but i was touched by the sheer brutality of the movie. Skeptics who say this movie was only made to make money and shock people with its violence are wrong: the movie was made to show people the suffering of Christ. Too many people take it lightly, but it was a mind boggling, horrid event. I wont ruin the movie for people who are yet to see it, but lets say at one point you see Christ's INSIDES. It's brutally violent, and for the most part historically accurate. Remember people: this is Gibson's interpretation. No one can make a completely ""accurate"" movie about Christ's torment and execution because no filmaker was there to see it, so please don't write reviews describing every tiny detail that you may think should have been shown differently. Shortly put, The Passion of the Christ is phenomenal and a brutal awakening for those who think it was all unimportant.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A290A3XO7XK33X	Prominence	"The ""Passion of the Christ"" is certainly the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life, simply because the movie is centered on a burning question about life after death. The movie (whether a documentary/not) is about the last 12 hours before the death of Jesus. Why he came in the first place (shown as flashbacks in the movie) and why he died (so we may be reconciled to God & have eternal life). It is very detailed in the suffering and humiliation he endures. (I'd be careful with having children younger than 15 see this movie)It starts with Jesus in the garden where he prays for God's help and mercy before he is betrayed by one of his disciples (who had been bribed by the priests at the time). He is handed over to the priests who question him and find him guilty for blasphemy from what he said about being the Son of God, this is after the false witnesses testimonies were found to contradict.He is taken to Pilate the Roman Governor of the time who finds no fault with him. For this reason he is tried before the king of his province, who also finds no fault in him. He is then returned to the Roman governor who orders that Jesus be crucified to please the people, so there is no uprising among them. The movie goes on to show every stage of his crucifixion in details. It ends with his resurrection.As for those concerned that the actor who plays Jesus is expressionless, well it's because that is what happened as recorded in the bible. Jesus never once tried to defend himself, he spoke very few words at his trials. And so it is in the movie. But even though there isn't a lot of talking, there is much loving in his eyes. For instance, he comforts his mother under so much pain and agony.For those uncomfortable with the movie for whatever reason, well you might want to ask why. This is not just for ""the sake of religion"" but it's about finding out why you are not comfortable and see what bothers you and try to find answers. One way is to go see the movie without any prejudice (christian or not). And find your own (correct) meaning to it.I think this is an awesome movie about love. Which isn't exactly the way Hollywood usually portrays it (love = sex). It is the story of one who loves enough to die for those he loves. I hope this helps."	5.0	Please see the movie with no prejudgement.	2004-11-23	21	14	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2VN986E5KR1NV	ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen)	"Theological debates may rage, but the fact remains that this film is a triumph of storytelling, directing, acting, cinematography, music, editing, costumes, set design, and every other aspect of filmmaking.  Upon seeing the film, Pope John Paul II said, ""It is as it was.""  Gibson's simple goal was to present the sufferings of Christ during the final few hours of his life...to note that it was not the Jews who killed Jesus, or even the Romans; it was all of us.  The sacrificial, voluntary, selfless way in which Christ gave Himself to die in our place is portrayed brilliantly by James Caviezel. His acting is nothing short of a tour de force that should--like Gibson--be recognized when award season rolls around.  The Aramaic and Hebrew languages add a ring of authenticity and poignancy to the film.  Bold, daring, imaginative...this is like no film you have ever seen.  Some have criticized the violent nature of the film--amazingly, these same critics seem to have little to say about the actual violent nature of Christ's death.  So many advocates of ""free speech"" tried to supress this film before its release, using scurrilous and baseless claims designed to stir hysterical fear. However, with nearly $380 million in US box office receipts alone, this film proved that it was something special; it has struck a chord in viewers in a way that films such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER'S LIST, and other ""noble classics"" have done in the past.  The DVD edition doesn't really have any extras, other than the theatrical trailer.  The film itself sits front and center...not there for our enjoyment...but a story impossible to ignore.

Gibson tried to make a Biblical epic but instead he ended up with something that looks somewhat like a snuff film. Pretty soon, the long scenes of torture get so sick, you just can't stand watching anymore. Why is the Crucifixion suddenly turning into a 1970s horror movie with demons, baby devils, Satan, and gore. Sometimes the torture got sick, other times it just got silly.I can't even believe that church leaders let their congregants watch this movie.

The acting, the music, the use of Aramaic/Hebrew/Latin in the film with the English subtitles, were all superb.Enter the DVD version.  The cinema and actors of course are great, but there is a narrator giving me a blow by blow (pun intended) running commentary of what I am watching on the screen, and another one reading the English subtiltles to me. The whole mood and atmosphere of the original movie is totally lost, and it seems to detract somewhat from the superb acting.

Gibson simply took what was independently attested history and placed it on film. If you don't believe me, all you need to do is to simply research this issue starting with the first century Jewish historian Josephus. So, this is not a horror flick or the production of some type of extremist. It presents a historically accurate presentation of a type of Roman execution. And yes, it's not pretty.The beauty of The Passion (i.e. suffering)of The christ and this movie is that it tells a story of someone who chose to suffer and die for what he thought was the salvation of human kind. Long after we have died and our children's children have been forgotten in history, this amazing narrative will continue to be told. Gibson is simply one link in a 2,000 year chain of sharing this remarkable moment in time.	5.0	Great Movie!!!	2006-05-15	10	5	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2YTUSSQKJIZPK	Rafael Amado	I'm not going to sit here and give you a review about my personal feelings of the film because my rating speaks for itself, but I will tell you what the truth is. Gibson, put his heart into making a detailed and accurate to the scriptures film. If you can't handle blood, don't go see this movie, as a matter of fact if you can't handle the truth, don't go see any historical movie or story that is going to try being as accurate as possible because the fact is life is pain and suffering and many great people have died horrible deaths for their beliefs and kindness. Ghandi was shot in cold blood just for preaching non violence, Joan of Ark was burned at the stake because of what she said and believed (not a pretty site!), Hitler massacred the Jews and believe me, that footage will haunt you, The Inquisition, Catholics burning and drowning women accused of witch craft, the massacre of millions of Native Americans, did you see AMISTAD? Throwing black slaves of a ship chained to each other to drown to death! (And a lot more movies about blacks!!)I finish a course in ancient History and the battles were bloody, the executions were horrible and the way people were treated is no easy task to depict in a film; so spare people the time of writing negative reviews because the film is bloody or it wasn't 7 hours long because you wanted to see other things and just be straight forward about it! There are plenty of over bloody battles and tortures in films (historians can mostly guess how much blood was shed in these situations) We probably will never know exactly how much or little blood did Jesus shed in his crucifixion .If people truly believe this film is to bloody, they have not watched many films or don't know much about the scriptures and history. We have all been cruel at some point in history and this film should be viewed positively. Jesus was tortured and killed for nothing but kindness, if you couldn't see that in this movie, then no one can help you. A story should be told to the fullest detail no mater how hard or graphic it might be and maybe we can learn something from reality and not bull (like fake thanksgiving movies!)All filmmakers deserve their creative views towards making a movie. There will be others who will try to tell this story, and we will get a chance to see other versions. Thumbs up! Great job Mel Gibson	5.0	Speechless!	2004-02-25	2	1	1

True, for the most part it's true Biblical text and very graphic in nature. Jesus died to save us, and I feel this film depicts that aspect of it greatly. My girlfriend and I couldn't help but cry, not because of someone trying to play with our emotions as some may think, not because of the graphic nature of the film. But more so due in part that was a depicting Jesus, our loving Savior. I feel that this film had to be made. Not, that Mel Gibson was the Director, or that he has a history of doing graphic films. Just that people really do need to see what Jesus went through for Us. I couldn't bare to sit through this a second time, but I'm glad I saw it the first time.The thing is this, you can go through it with a fine toothed comb, analising it. Yet, the Reality is it's biblically true to the text(for the most part). In which case it doesn't matter who directed it. In fact Mel Gibson spent his own money to make the Film, and as far as I'm aware, was donating most if not all of the Profits from this film.

A jew helps Jesus carry the cross, tries to bring him water, etc.  Jesus himself is a jew!  The early christians in this movie, if you could call them that, are the ones that betray and desert him.This movie is about people in power, particularly religious people in power, always thinking they are right.  These people are always the first to hate and to shed blood in the name of religion.  History is ripe with this: the spanish inquisition, the burning of ""witches"", the condemnation of Galileo, ad nauseam.  Even the high priests in the KKK are guilty of this.Those leaders in the movie that hate Jesus so much could be from ANY religion.  It is irrelevant.  What is relevant is that they have power and that they hate.  Jesus NEVER teaches hate, even though many christians out there do hate when they should not.It's a good movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2VXLLBBT7CL89	"R. Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun"""	"After hearing how so many folks in the evangelical Christian community have approved of this film, I went in with a great hope that I would experience some sort of epiphany; a renewal of the mind, in which I'd see things clearer about the hope of Christ in my otherwise tired life.  So I took half a day off, the only way I can see an honest-to-goodness movie any more in this regimented life, and took my seat.  It surely smacked of authenticity, as we see in the most compelling of ways how the King of the Jews was smacked around by the kind of sadistic folks that hold power in a dreary Roman backwater.  In the more comical words of Will Smith as Jim West (""Wild, Wild West""), ""now THAT was a whuppin'"".But the initial question posed by satan, which ran along the lines of ""how can one man's death remove the sins of all mankind?"", remained without much of an improvement on the answer.  I suppose I should have brought a little more faith with me to the theater.  If you're into Scripture and like the infallibility of the Bible, well, this is a good one.  The script is faithful to the Gospels, through and through.  I was thinking that what we have here is the vision of canonical Christianity for 2004, just as we saw for 1959 with ""Ben Hur"".  But while a movie like this is fine raw material for the inspired, who have a better map of just where the pieces fit in the implied majesty of the makers of initial premise, it is not as directed to the wandering ones who are after a compelling reason for holding such premises in the first place.  The choir needs the sermon, yes, but even more so the backsliders and the non-contrite.I don't know why I'm so down on such a fine and time-tested story.  It could well be the cynicism of this day, in which faith is not so readily accepted at face value.  I suspect that were I in a true state of grace, I'd be putting down the five stars.  This must not be the year for that kind of stuff.I did sit in one sitting through the entire 126 minutes, for the pugilism of Roman and Jew alike, with every variety of contemporary weapon formed in those days, was sensational in itself.  The character best portrayed is that of Pilate, who realizes he has a real problem on his hands.  There are so many flashbacks to the high points of Christ's ministry, such as the Sermon on the Mount, the stoning of the adultress, the Last Supper, etc., only what we end up with is a crucified King.  Are we simply being told to turn our other cheeks, the way ""Yeshua"" turns just about every part of his body to the scourgings?  If I was supposed to have a personal experience of Jesus Christ as my Personal Savior through this film, well, I'll stick with the ones I had as a much younger man.  The emphasis of the progressive ministry is, after all, a call for direct dialogue and personal experience, rather than being shown in imagery an interpretation that purports to be authentic.  I suppose I'm seeing in a mirror what might one day be seen clearly, to borrow from Paul.Were we not so entirely inculcated in Western culture with the Passion narrative, I'm not thinking this would be such a compelling drama.  Some upstart of the countryside has a cult following, he's picked up as a security threat to the government, and is beaten to a pulp, prior to his execution.  It would be better with an international terrorist conspiracy, perhaps, one that fights with automatic weapons and grenade launchers.  It seems strange, that the the leader of the good guys should get such treatment.To the film's credit in advocating the love of those that torment you, I found that I was better able to tolerate the horrendous city traffic getting home, when this was done.  Still, during that same interval, I turned on the CD in the truck of Webber & Rice's ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and felt a good bit more in the 60's version of the way it was, on that day, when he took my sins away.The crucifixion, indeed, is a riddle.  ""To conquer death you only have to die"" (J.C.S., ""Poor Jerusalem"")?  Is that something like a Zen koan?"	4.0	The Passion, for A.D. 2004	2004-03-09	10	1	9

Others were so quick to find fault, believing the film cast blame on the Jews or the Romans.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2	"R. C. Walker ""catu11us"""	"Let us surmise that in the heady early days of the Third (or Temporary) Reich, Herr Doktor Gobbles commissioned ... um ooops ... Doktor Goebbels commissioned a film the purpose of which would be to discredit Christianity.  Let us further surmise that the result was a film called ""The Passion of the Christ"".  Given these results, the filmmaker would have been awarded German filmdom's highest award, the Adolf, plus a special thorn cluster authorized by Herr Doktor Goebbels.  That was then.This is now.  And here it is at last:  a new technologically advanced edition of the world's slimiest ""Bible"" travesty in all its Gospel-bashing, anti-Semitic, and fantasy-pushing glory.Aside from its propagandistic purposes, ""Passion"" is so full of inaccuracies, it's hard to know where to start.  Let's start by noting that the only historically worthwhile (if not necessarily accurate) narratives we have of the so-called ""passion"" are the 4 canonical gospels.  Nothing else of a non-scholarly nature is worth the paper it's printed on.  This film depends on apocryphal (and useless) narratives, the ravings of a 19th-Century hysteric nun, and other fraudulent ""sources"".  In addition there are other solecisms of a purely stupid nature.For instance, Gibson thinks he's really clever by having people speak the languages they would have spoken at the time.  And then, laughably, he has Jesus and Pilate conversing in Latin.  Latin was not the lingua franca of the Roman East ... that was Greek.  Furthermore, Jesus was born (at Bethlehem-in-Galilee, not Bethlehem-in-Judea) and raised in Galilee, an area which was under the Hebrew- and Greek-speaking rule of various Herods.  Jesus and Pilate would have spoken in Greek.  (The argument that Jesus would have learned Latin from Roman soldiers is just silly ... Galilee was part of an autonomous kingdom and Roman soldiers didn't enter the area until after the exile of Herod Antipas in 39 CE.  Besides, the Roman military spoke a patois of Italic - related to Latin - that was widely used in northern Italy.)Gibson's contempt for the canonical gospels is a main theme of the film.  In Gethsemane, Jesus is shown not so much praying to his god but having a conversation with Satan - something the gospel writers seem totally unaware of.  Later on, the soldiers that arrest Jesus throw him bodily from a bridge - an event utterly absent from the gospels.The events between Jesus' arrest and his crucifixion show not only Gibson's contempt for the gospels, but also his utter ignorance of the practices of Roman law and the evidence of archaeology.  The bit covering his appearance before the Sanhedrin is hilarious.  The charge - the only charge - was actually a term totally misused these days, ""blasphemy"".  That is, in the Greek, ""blasphemia"", which means treason, in the sense that Jesus has claimed to be King of Judea.  Despite pathetic attempts by Christians, from the First Century CE on, to give this term a religious connotation, it is a political crime, pure and simple.  Gibson's failure to recognize this fact is stupid - as is everything else in this film.The scourging of Jesus is a good example of Gibson's contempt for facts.  Roman judicial procedure is well known and the gospels in fact do a fair job of showing it correctly.  Gibson's version is not only inaccurate, it's trashy.  The pronouncing of sentence of crucifixion ends with this sentence:  ""Let him be scourged.""  No person to be tried before a Roman court was whipped until that sentence was uttered.Furthermore, the whip shown in this film wasn't the one used in these cases - it was employed by Gibson solely for its shock value, not in any interest of accuracy.  The actual whip (Latin: flagellum) consisted of several strands of leather of varying length, each tied to a small lead ball.  If you believe the Shroud of Turin is any sort of genuine artifact, please note that it is that whip whose marks appear on the back of the individual portrayed in the shroud.  This tool of punishment also appears in archaeological contexts.The number of strokes was limited to a those needed to start a flow of blood - the purpose of scourging being primarily to weaken the victim and shorten his/her time on the cross.  They were delivered by a trained professional.  What Gibson's film shows is not only ridiculously excessive but incomprehensibly and improbably brutal.  This portrayal is clearly for salacious shock value and not any concern for truth.  It is at this point (if not before) that the film degenerates into a work of pure fiction.There is, however, more degeneracy to come.  In a scene that occurs nowhere in the gospels nor any other creditable source, Mary is wandering among the pools of blood in the courtyard in which Jesus was scourged.  We'll forego questioning how she got past all those guards into a secure area of a Roman fortress.  Then out trundles Mrs. Pilate with an armload of bedsheets or used togas or some such.  She vanishes and Mary begins to mop up all the blood with togas or sheets or whatever.  Say what?  Is she collecting souvenirs?  I can see a framed slice of sheet on a humble wall in Nazareth.  ""There's a toga of actual blood!""  What ... you don't like the bit about the frame on the wall?  That's just as disgusting and stupid as somebody mopping up blood in the first place.  No wonder the gospels ignore the whole silly story in the first place.  Not only is it silly, it's a fairy tale insulting to the intelligence of anyone whose cerebrum's weight exceeds 1 ounce.Ah, but wherefore Herr Dr. Goebbels' award of the prestigious thorn cluster?  Well, of course:  the film's stunning if subtle anti-Semitism.  We could point to the film's zeal in promoting the old canard that the Jews ""forced"" a conviction on a Roman governor who in fact would just as soon crucify people as look at them.We can and do point to one of the film's most prominent characters - one who actually appears only once, in a brief sentence, in the gospels' passion narratives.  This character is Satan, the so-called devil, who pops up everywhere in this film.  This character is the most palpable, horrifying manifestation of the film's anti-Semitism.  This manifestation takes the form of Satan being cast as a First Century Jew ... right down to the shawl over his head.This libelous identification of Judaism with Christianity's evil angel must of course give much schadenfreude to nutters like the Aryan Brotherhood, the American Nazi Party, and others who live only to hate.  Gibson's depiction of Satan as an embodiment of Judaism - this nation's moral bedrock - is an act of the most desperate bigotry.Considering that ""Passion"" is a tissue of lies and misrepresentations, an affront to anyone who values and respects the gospels, and a virtual celluloid hate crime, we would expect Christians everywhere to shun it for the arrant nastiness that it is.  But what do we find?  They are busy declaring this shabby travesty a triumph of their faith.  What does that say of them?  Fools have rushed in where our better angels would fear to tread.Shame, Mel Gibson; shame, shame."	1.0	Blue Passion -- the triumph of anti-Semitism	2008-11-18	22	8	14
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AFJFXN42RZ3G2	"R. DelParto ""Rose2"""	Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ was extremely moving.  How can words describe what I had viewed?  Words cannot completely describe what this film means because it is one of those movies that must be seen in order to understand the meaning of it all.However, besides the film's violence, it is the silence and the expressions from the actors' faces and their actions that make the movie.  The film was originally supposed to be released in the arthouse circuit, but I'm glad that it was widely released because it enabled me to understand what the controversy was all about. Though, I do not think there is any controversy because the film is based on Christ's last days.I was impressed how Gibson implemented authentic dialogue rather than have the actors speak in English. As with most period films, there always appears to be inaccuracies with the actors speaking with cheesy British accents.  In addition, I give the cinematographers a hand for the first few scenes of the film because they gave an ominous and foretelling effect to the movie; the film appeared to look like a horror or sci-fi movie with its darkness and smoke.I believe one must have an objective eye and a strong stomach in order to survive the viewing of this film.  For those who are religiously inclined, Christ's suffering becomes a reality, and for those non-believers, the film will show how little our world has changed when it comes to humanity.	5.0	Extreme Passion	2004-03-04	40	33	7

It is a later pronunciation widely used by the Roman Catholic Church and characteristic of versions of Latin that became the Romance languages.Although this is a remarkable dramatic work, even believers may need to be reminded that it is still merely a movie, representing or dramatizing, but of course not recording, real events, including Jesus' resurrection, just as a movie about, say, Lincoln's assassination would depict, but cannot actually record, real events of 1865.  Dramatic representations of the Passion are so commonplace that one would easily feel encouraged to think of it as myth and to forget that it all actually happened, in just one way, as real events do happen.  No photographs survive, not because there was no scene to be photographed, but because photography came along some 1830 years later.

I never understood why anyone would not want to celebrate the happier occasion (the resurrection of Christ, showing the power to rise from the dead). After watching this movie, I have a much better understanding of why some people wear necklaces with crucifixtion pendants, which before this movie I always thought was strange and a bit grotesque. After watching the brutal treatment of Christ in this movie, I now understand that the pendants are worn to remind the wearer of the huge sacrifice Christ made for man. The movie may be considered violent and gross, but I think all Christians owe it to themselves to watch it and to more fully realize the sacrifice that Christ made (not just giving up his life, but enduring a slow and painful death, with constant mocking, beforehand). To me, watching this movie is what Easter should be all about. In addition to learning about his tribulation, I really like how this movie is interspersed with backflashes of Christ shown in various ""teaching moments"" that all Christians will recall from the Bible. It is in these moments that those watching the movie, Christians and non-Christians alike, will see what his teachings were all about and what made people want to follow him, both then and now."	5.0	Movie Brings Better Understanding	2011-04-22	3	1	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2K6GF1FATZPRB	Rev.  Stephen Beck	This past year the controversial new Mel Gibson movie the Passion of the Christ came out.  This movie is nothing but pain, suffering, and torture the whole way through.  However, even though it is not by any means, a fun and enjoyable movie to watch, it tells a true story and has a great theme and should be seen at least once a year (Easter is the obvious example) to remind us about what our Savior did for us.

As a cinematic achievement, it is nothing short of brilliant: photography, music and, particularly, editing. Gibson's vision was sincere, and it has shone true, blindingly! Historically, one must remember that the Romans were in control of the area; they thought the Jewish patriarchs were a silly bunch of fanatics, and pretty much left them alone. So much so, that when threatened by Christ's ideology, one that would threaten the power they held over the majority, they had to eliminate the threat. Neither Pilate nor Herod wanted to be bothered, so they let the elders have their way. This is not an anti-Semitic depiction. Rather, the ""reigning"" majority found necessity in eliminating a threat to their very existance. This has happened throughout most recorded history. To call Gibson an anti-Semite is absurd. I found this to be historically accurate, without prejudice, and a brutal and honest display of those times (as well as we could imagine it). The Romans were portrayed as a bunch of mean drunks. Was Gibson anti-Roman? I give him credit for exposing his views in such a profound fashion. When I was a bartender, I learned that the two things you never discuss are religion and politics, because no two people will ever agree. Gibson took these two ever-present elements of the world society and shoved them in your face, fearlessly and without shame. I am amazed at his achievement, and applaud his artistry and his guts.

And Mel not only put forth the last twelve hours of Jesus' life, but he also implemented his own style and thought into it and that's why I applaud this film. Every Jesus film I have ever seen has been dull. The director is afraid to implement style or substance beyond the scripture or connect any dotted lines and then here comes Mel Gibson, whom does so while not sacrificing story in the least. I'm not saying forget a detail about a scripture or change anything, but don't be afraid to imply something thematically. Don't just let the camera catch everything that the scriptures says and...that's it.This is what filmmaking is all about. Mel Gibson represents all that Hollywood lacks in this horrible decade of film. He is a go-getter. I have studied the scriptures a long time and the pain stakingly miniscule details he put in are amazing. Some of Jesus' quotes that Mel applied are buried deep within the New Testament where only the intense readers would know and add beautiful authenticity to the film.	5.0	I HAVE SEEN THIS PRODUCT!!!!	2004-08-25	11	4	7

I know very well that Christ died for me in such unmeasurable pain. But do I really need to see it in a gory kind of way? What's unrealistic is the way the punishment was portrayed- too harsh for a human to endure, I mean physically. We must remember that Christ was 100 % human during that time and subject to physical limitations of a human being. The sufferings were simply portrayed as too unbelievable. Any human subject to that kind of punishment will die sooner from loss of blood, broken bones, and other internal organ damages. Didn't you see how Mary the mother's towel get soaked in so much blood? it looked like you can squeeze it and get a gallon of blood. Simply put, the movie is overly exaggerated. Some members of the Catholic Church said that it was the closest thing to the truth. What truth? What's the basis? If it cannot be 100% true, then it is still a lie- a Hollywood flick.	3.0	Unrealistic	2004-11-23	15	7	8

I heard the word ""controversy"" again and again but I could care less about the hype.  Any film based around religion will be controversial.I pop the movie and it start basically at the betrayal by Judas.  Already I'm disappointed since much more happened in Jesus's life.  But alright.  So the beatings begin.  And it continues relentlessly until the movie ends when Jesus dies on the crucifix.  I kinda figured out about an hour into the beatings/movie what Gibson was trying to depict.  So I sit threw it.  The accuracy of this movie was believable.  By accuracy I mean how and where the movie was filmed, not the biblical accuracy.  I'm not very religious so I wouldn't know this side of it.  The only unbelievable part for me was how badly he was beaten.  I personally would have died in the first 30 minutes of the beatings.The gore factor was off the hook.  Many people have used the word gore in their reviews for a reason.  We're not talking violent, brutal, or cruel...we mean gore.  I had a hard time watching some of it.I wish I rented the movie instead of buying it though.  It was one of those movies that only need to be watched once.  I wouldn't show this movie to kids but that's just my personal opinion.I'll give Gibson credit for one thing though.

I DO believe Jesus died for our sins and historical inaccuracies or not(NOBODY was there)- all should see this movie that even recognize the goodness of a man like Jesus. I've never understood the controversy and never felt that the Jewish people were RESPONSIBLE for the death of Jesus --- ""God sent his only begotten son..........."" - it HAD to happen for the rest to be fulfilled.  Was it bloody and cruel?? Yes - sorry to tell you this but people are cruel at times and I'm sure crucifixion was not at all a pleasant, write home about it experience.Most death sentences aren't.I see no need to pick the excellent film apart no matter what your belief system is.

I could tell by seeing this movie that even our teen children can be greatly affected by this movie, positive or negative I can't say. That statement quoted, I will give my personal opinion. I heartbroken by this movie, yes I know it was his choice to die for our sins, and also I applaud Mel for writing and or directing the movie but I was still stunned and compelled by how he suffered for us. Having the devil tormenting Christ was like The Tempatation or the devil appearing made it even more sinister. My husband didn't even know it was the devil he coudn't tell. There were definate flaws,but have any of the religious movies in the past been accurate? Truth is no one knows what transpired by his death. I still enjoyed this movie even though the version is not how I remembered it. See this movie. The movie achieved what it set out to do, and think that Mel Gibson made this movie for all of us so that we would think about it. Christ's last hours on our world was not fun, it was painful and heartwrenching,and if we understood this we can understand ourselves better.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AEK6DH2THQH3W	Ricardo Garcia	"OK. This movie features only jews (normal, it takes place in ancient Jerusalem) and the roman occupation army... so the bad guys are jews and romans, and so are the good guys. I really don't see any racism in there!To what extent the film has any historical relevance whatsoever depends solely on the strenght of you religious beliefs...To what extent this film has any religious value, strongly depends on the nature of your devoutnessIn any case, i didn't see any cinematographic interest in this movie whatsoever : nothing from the artistic point of view.Now, imagine a film called ""the passion of Jo"" that would show how Jo, a persian carpet seller, was intercepted at a roman checkpoint, wrongly accused of treason, and violently tortured and executed. Imagine that the film features for half an hour how Jo's naked body is exposed, beaten, cut, lacerated, how his flesh is torn into pieces, and how the romans mock him and take pleasure in inflicting him extreme pain before they nail him to a cross. Of course, poor Jo would like to say something interesting for the screenplay, but the script only allows him to say ""aaaaarrrhhh!""... Imagine such a film, and you have ""the Passion of Christ"" with a different name for the main character. Of course, such a film would be rated X and nobody would bother seeing it, except perhaps for the few people who are into extreme sado-masochism.So why do people go to see THIS movie? Because it is Our Lord Jesus Christ! Yes, the interest of this film is directly proportional to your degree of devoutness...For a much better piece of cinematography, and on the same subject, see rather THE LIFE OF BRIAN.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A386NVAVQV5WUO	"Richard D. Cappetto ""RickDC"""	I went to see the Passion of the Christ today (3-4-04), and all I can say is WOW, what a Powerful movie. I read all the negative reviews (before I went) and thought I was in for some kind of documentary on crucifixion, or a gory movie filled with violence; but instead it was a riveting story, and the violence fit the movie theme perfectly (I think most reviews just don't get it, cause they don't believe in sin) this movie is about GOD's LOVE for us sinners; the violence Christ suffered serves the purpose of forgiving all our sins. Also I heard all the arguments about the movie being anti Semitic, but how could it be, Jesus, the Apostles (especially John who is featured throughout the movie), Marry Jesus' mother and Mary were all Jewish. The movies shows that only some priests wanted Jesus crucified and that they stirred up a mob to pressure pilot to put Christ to death, as the scriptures say. It in no way casts blame on all Jewish people and in fact if everyone would just read ISAIHA chapter 53 in the Jewish scriptures that would see that the Christ came to die for us. Also I heard an argument that it shows Jews as ugly and hooked nosed and this is pure BS, the ugliest person in the movie was the actor who played the apostle Peter.  Really the Roman's look the worst in this movie; All the priest looked normal to me. The movie (all 2:06) went by fast. While I would not call this movie entertaining (it was in a way), because of the subject matter, it was emotionally gripping, and visually engrossing and I was completely transfixed by the movie. My mind did not wonder off (like usual at a movie), Not once. It garbed my attention from the first moment in the garden and kept it till the resurrection. The passion of The Christ is brilliant, Fantastic, and I think the best and most important movie ever made. the movie has a powerful soundtrack and the cinematography is fantastic.

Not unwarranted though - as the reality and horror of the time really emanates throughout the narrative. I think people do need to see this, experience this to further their understanding about religion and its purpose in our lives. And just sitting in a theater hearing people sobbing throughout was powerful in and of itself.The historical aspect of it, would be difficult to argue because nobody knows for sure what happened. Solely taking biased words (gospels) of disciples and scribes telling it in their own way is a bit too narrow and naive. Also translating it to film lends to an almost-excessive sensationalization of fact. There exists tons of research about the historical period that contradicts most of the words/gospels in scripture (and a serious case can be made for over exaggeration).The Roman leaders in this movie, I believe, were depicted as taking a neutral stance on the trial, with the crazy Caiphas and his crowd basically swaying their decisions to the crucifixion sentencing. I can understand the hesitation by the Jewish community regarding the matter afraid of it boiling over to anti-semitic sentiment.However, coming from a Jewish background myself, I urge everyone to understand one thing about the time period. Judaism had many sects. The people responsible for the backlash against Yeshua were the equivalent of the Islamic Fundamentalists today (as opposed to the peaceful religion of Islam). Crazed, self-involved, arrogant and dangerous these people were. And taking LAW too literally. Religion is not meant to be read or practiced that way. Yeshua himself was Jewish.  His followers were Jewish.  His tormenters were Jewish (and Pagans).  Get the idea?  You might as well call it Politics. Fanatical Talmud followers took things over the edge. And their priests were corrupt, and self-interested who cared not for the simple and peaceful teachings of a supposed prophet, and someone who was stirring up the status-quo. Making a scene amongst the masses, if you will. They were more concerned with crowd control and the Passover celebration getting out of hand, than worried that one man would take over as leader of Jerusalem.Again, remember that Yeshua himself was Jewish. As was Mary. As were his followers. His teachings were basic fundamental principles from the Torah mixed with slightly unorthodox mystical Judaism. The overly abused statement ""He was betrayed by his own people"" could not be more incorrect. Clumping all Jews into one group is wrong. It is like yelling at an Arab neighbor about 9-11. It is groundless and unjustifiable. Caiphas and his crew were clearly NOT Yeshua's people.I am all over the place with this review because I am tired as I am writing this... I will stop now. Just open your minds and your hearts and enjoy the film for what it brings to the table.

This movie was by all means the most accurate depiction of what the crucifixion was truly like.  Not only the crucifixion, but the last twelve hours of the Life of Christ.  Not only was the horrific act openly portrayed, but we were introduced to the true pain of the mother of Christ witnessing this disjustice being done to her son.  We were also witnesses to the author's portrayal of the certain presence of evil that truly accompanied the act.The accuracy of the film evidenced the directors knowledge of the text.  He certainly strayed very little from the gospel writters accounts.My fear is that many will see it as ""just another movie"".However, there was something missing on the big screen that would have made the impact of the movie a little more sustaining.

It's so amazing that you don't need words. I was amazed how spectacular this movie was. I have been a Christian for a really long time now and I really do believe that this movie has opened my eyes a whole lot more and made me a stronger Christian because I could actually feel the pain jesus was going through. It was just stunning. Definitly not for children or the faint of heart. As I left the theater, there was not a dry eye anywhere to be found. Everybody cryed during the movie. Even I did, and believe me, I'm not much of a cryer. I heard some talk saying that some people didn't want to see it because of the subtitles. It doesn't really matter. It's not even that bad. Just picture it as reading a book, but with moving pictures. Just dazzling! You can really feel the pain for Jesus while he is being tortured. The whole torture scene was one of the most gruesome things in movie history that I've ever seen. I really do think that the violence is just there to show how brutal people were back then. During some violent scenes, such as the pounding of the nails and Jesus bearing the cross, they would switch to a flash back for an instant such as the last supper to ease some of the stress for the viewer so they don't take in the whole thing at once. One of my favorite parts was when Jesus is resurrected at the end, and as he gets up and walks by, you see the holes in his hands left by the nails. This movie really gave me a whole new perspective on life and how I take alot of things for grantit. I also have a stronger relationship with God now cause now I fully understand the pain and torment Jesus went through just to save sinful men. I recomend this movie to anyone. This movie will leave you with a whole new perspective on everything. Just beyond amazing.	5.0	BEYOND WORDS	2004-03-02	1	0	1

Seeing blood and gore from the moment the movie begins until the moment the movie ends is not what Christ was all about.

I guess so, if they truly believe this is a good movie, or for that matter a heart moving movie.I suggest seeing ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", or ""Jesus of Nazareth"" These movies represent excellent acting and a portrayal of the life of Jesus that is accurate and complete. The Passion shows the agony but no ecstasy and that's it. Those who know the bible know what Jesus went thru on his last days on earth as a man.

For that, and for showcasing the power of cinema, and for the entertainment value, this movie gets 5 stars.There is a mystic quality that moves throughout the movie... The role of Jesus is played beautifully. One can't help but feel pity for Jesus, but the editorial review's claim that even non-believers may feel culpable is nonsense. Non-believers, however, may feel amused that many will consider this movie a representation of history, as if the Christian Bible is an accurate account. Also, it is highly unlikely that anyone will be conned into thinking that Jesus physically suffered enough to bear the sins of a potentially infinite number of believers, though enough maybe to bear the sins of say 2-3 protestants that were burned alive. I also didn't think the movie comes off as anti-Semitic to someone who does not have much knowledge of Judeo-Christian history.Though it is a fine piece of art, the movie is as unconvincing as the irrational Bible-pushers in the proposition that Yeshu was a Christ and he suffered for our sins, and that blind belief in him is fair game for a god that will send believers to heaven and the rest of us to hell and that too for an infinite time for finite sins. But then, I doubt if Gibson seriously wanted to convert non-blind-believers; he wanted to pay a tribute to his god, and he has done that well.	5.0	A non-Christian's review	2004-09-01	24	8	16

IT WAS WRITTEN BEFORE MEL GIBSON EVER LIFTED HIS PEN TO WRITE. IT WAS WRITTEN ON CALVARY AND IT WAS WRITTEN IN RED.	5.0	THE PAIN, THE BURDEN, THE BLOOD, THE LOVE	2004-08-02	9	8	1

It comes straight from the Bible. I didn't recognize any added sensation or fiction. This is how it must have been. Too cruel? Does anybody believe that what Jesus had to go through for us was anything better than what is being shown here?	5.0	Great job, Mel!	2004-12-19	9	5	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AAPELIXUOH3R8	Rivendell	I have owned this DVD of The Passion of the Christ for over a year but I didn't sit down and see it for the first time until this Good Friday.  I delayed watching this movie all that time because I listened and read many people's descriptions of the brutal violence, which I allowed to sway me against it for a long time.  But now that I've finally seen it, I'm very glad I did.  The film is excellent, the acting across the board is superb - Jim Caviezel's incredible portrayal of Jesus will forever be the definitive cinema Christ for me,  the cinematography is also first rate, and the music is beautiful to listen to.  The violence is tough to watch but it is not gratuitous.  Jesus according to the Gospels did endure horrific brutality and Roman crucifixion was designed by the state to be a savage deterrent.  Two scenes that stick with me are the playful loving tenderness between Jesus and Mary when Mary calls Jesus inside for mealtime while he is busy building a table, and the other is Simon of Cyrene screaming at the people and soldiers to stop beating Jesus as he was lying on the ground, then whispering to Jesus that they are almost there as he helped him carry his cross to Golgotha.  That was a very powerful and moving scene, among many throughout the film.  Whatever anyone thinks of Mel Gibson as a person, he used his talent and considerable skill to create what has turned out to be one of the most important films ever made in cinema history. It will become an annual tradition for many to see it during Good Friday and Easter and will continue to have lasting influence and benefits in people's lives for a long time to come.	5.0	The definitive depiction of Christ's Passion	2008-03-21	4	1	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2G823E0F20DR4	R. J. Luedke	Clearly one of the most powerful presentations of the Passion story ever put to film, but possibly a little over the top in its graphic depiction.  As a regular reader of the Bible, and researcher in biblical/archelogical history...most points made through the movie rang true, but might be confusing to the Christian newby.  The depiction of the abuse and torture suffered by Jesus, though accurate, was overdone for effect, (in a way familiar to those who viewed Gibson's Braveheart).  Could the same feeling have been passed on, with a few minutes of footage left on the cutting room floor?  Most likely.  This would have also opened the door for more younger teens and children's viewing.  As is, still powerful...put possibly overwelming to the spiritually uninformed and less mature.Robert James Luedke, (Author...Eye Witness: A Fictional Tale of Absolute Truth)	3.0	A Mixed Bag of Revelations	2005-03-02	2	1	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A167G3U4RB5J42	R. J. Riggs	"I have to quote Pat Buchanan on this.On coming away from a first, full viewing of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" among the questions that came is mind was: What in heaven's name was all the howling about?For the all-powerful impression this emotionally draining film leaves one with is that this is what the Son of God went through for our sins and our salvation. Those who called ""The Passion"" anti-Semitic without seeing it, who tried to censor it and keep it out of theaters, and who trashed it as pornographic as soon as it appeared on Ash Wednesday have made perfect fools of themselves.Gibson's ""Passion"" gives us a Lenten masterpiece, a beautiful moving work of art. To cradle Catholics who can recite the lines of each episode before they are uttered, it is faithful to the Gospels, to the Stations of the Cross, to the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary.But what you come out of this film with depends on what you took in. If you are looking for evidence of Jewish villainy, you can find it in Caiphas... and in the pathetic figure of Judas the betrayer.But almost all the heroines and heroes are also Jews.For this is, after all, a Jewish and Roman story, though Caiphas appears as a cartoon villain alongside Pilate, the more interesting figure. For Pilate is gripped by a moral dilemma, and takes the weakling's way out, ordering Christ crucified -- though he believes Christ to be innocent.But the gleeful sadistic brutality of the Roman soldiers who scourge Christ near to death and to their own sweaty exhaustion, and to the disgust of their centurion, is more memorable and indelible. Yet no one has suggested the film is anti-Roman or anti-Italian.Which brings us to the heart of the matter: Mel Gibson is under attack not because he twisted the Gospels but because his film is faithful to the Gospels. It is anti-Semitic only if the Gospels are anti-Semitic, only if Christianity is anti-Semitic, only if a hatred of Jews is embedded in the New Testament from Gethsemane to Golgotha. But no true follower of Christ can believe that about Him or about His mission or His words.Indeed, in the savagery of the attacks on Gibson what is coming out of the closet is a visceral hatred of Christianity.Consider: Art critics have instructed us to appreciate that the ""Piss Christ,"" a figurine of Jesus on the Cross in a jar or urine, was art; that a portrait of the Madonna with elephant dung smeared on it and female genitalia surrounding the face is artistic freedom of expression that must be respected.We were told ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" that portrayed Jesus as a lustful wimp pining over Mary Magdalene was a beautiful film. Yet the same critics tell us ""The Passion"" is an insult to decency that should never have been made.What we see here is naked hypocrisy. Traditional Christians must accept ""art"" that degrades the symbols of their Faith in the name of artistic freedom, but a film that upholds the Faith, to which the Hollywood elite objects, will cost you your career.Gibson has scored a triumph in the culture war by telling The Greatest Story Ever Told with artistry and courage, while under a year-long attack by enemies whose hatred of the Gospel truths caused them to stumble and blunder themselves into laughable absurdity.And there is an ancillary benefit. Because of the over-the-top attacks on Gibson, millions who see ""The Passion"" will also come to see the slur of ""anti-Semite!"" for what it has all too often become, an attempt to smear, silence, intimidate, ostracize and blacklist."	5.0	What in heaven's name was all the howling about?	2004-06-28	14	9	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A25VW7Z8GQK76Z	"RLangdon80 ""Ron"""	Until now, I am still stunned and speechless about the film after I watched it from the advance screening for Philippine theatre just today. It was the first time it has been shown in our country sponsored by a group of young christians who are ministering for the campus. It was supposed to be shown here before Holy Week but I have the chance to watch it first! I am so excited and eager to see this film for the very first time, I thought I will not be able to purchase a ticket which is so expensive but luckily I got one. I can't let go of this opportunity! The whole theatre was jampacked with hundreds of enthusiasts, excited, curious, religious, and even skeptics moviegoers. People from all walks of life were there to see for themselves why 'The Passion...' is really a 'passionate', 'brutally', 'movingly', and 'artistically' crafted by actor-producer-director Mel Gibson. If you were only there in the theatre for 1 to 2 hours, you can observe and see people watching quietly, with immense emotion and concentrating to the pace of the movie most especially to some scenes which is virtually 'a pain' in the eyes.Technically, the graphical presentation of the passion is really an extreme. I can't help but to close my eyes whenever the Roman soldiers would scourge the back of Jesus and blood spurting on their faces and flesh were torn apart by the blades and spikes of the lashes. The sound of the ripping flesh, striking lashes, unpleasant laughters and shouts of the soldiers and mobs were really audible. This film could make it as a long 'torturing' film about the passion of Christ of all the movies that were made about Christ!  I would like to give a strong discretion for those minor viewers for intense graphic and visual effects because of 'bloodied' scenes. Parents ought to guide their children if they view this film.About the film, 'The Passion...' has presented the accuracy and historicity of the final 12 hours of Christ in some aspects which were recorded by the evangelists and bible historians. It was well-researched and consulted. The impressive thing here is the use of languages of latin and aramaic which considred to be  dead languages. Thanks to the film producers that it has provided the sub-titles in English. The languages used were a plus factor for the uniqueness and authenticity of what it presents the subject. Though the languages spoken were unique, it is never a difficulty nor a factor for a viewer to follow the story but moreover, the viewer can really grasp the essentials of the dialogues. I lauded Mel Gibson for his direction of this film because I appreciate some of the symbolic gestures used in this film like when Simon of Cyrene was carrying the cross together with Christ , and with their both shoulders and arms embracing the cross...very meaningful! Gibson is fond of slow motion, and he really uses a lot of it to some scenes which are vulnerable like the scourging at the pillar, the crowning f thorns, the crucifixin, and many more! and the cameras are turning 360 degrees as for its special effects.Jim Caviezel delievered his role as Jesus was really impressive and outstanding...you can really moved by Jim's acting with such impressive performance. Other casts are great and performed well with such convincing portrayals.I don't believe that this film is anti-Semitic because one thing I can say is that the Jewish were also the victims here. We don't generalize things here because not all Jews during the time of Christ's crucifixion is not really representing all Jews in general. Jews were victims here because of the deception that the high priest and his council have done to Jesus. Jesus is a jew too, remember? he is also the victim here as part of the Jewish community. It's fair to say that not all Jewish were the people who put Jesus to death but only the misguided Jews who are deceived and blinded by the falsity made by the men who called themselves God's representative.So, if you want a long torturing film about the passion experienced by Christ...I recommend this film but you must hold on to your seats to fully bear the visual and graphic contents of this film. Over-all, a great and exceptionally film for all denominations of faith and all walks of life! The Passion is really in here!	5.0	The Passion Is In Here!	2004-03-19	10	6	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2IPIAIO5S9M9H	R. Mitchell	This film is so beautiful, it is beyond words.  Yes, there is graphic violence.  I don't think you could tell the story of Jesus's crucifixion without it.  And I think it makes it all the more real for the viewer.  We can almost taste the pain that Jesus suffered for us.  It really brought home to me just how much Jesus sacrificed himself for us.  No other story of his life has done it for me.  This one did.Beyond the story itself, this movie was beautifully filmed and directed.  If you pause the movie at any time, the picture you are left with looks like some of the greatest art and imagery I have ever seen.The acting is perfect.The editing, I thought had some problems.Overall, a must-see movie whether you are a believer in the divinity of Jesus or not.	5.0	haunting and inspring	2005-03-21	10	9	1

Sure its Bloody but people NEED to see how painful and messy their sin is on the shoulders of one man.  I hate reading the 1 star negative reviews.  It makes me sick at how people Shuck this movie off.  If you are a Christian and Didnt leave the theater or take the DVD out of the player without crying after you watched.. chances are youre probaly heartless.  Our Generation needs to see that they are so loved by God that he wont punish us for our sins we've committed but instead punished his only son instead.  I know i felt remorse for the bad stuff I've done in my life after i washed Jesus get Slaughtered in front of my eyes.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A188KU3SI543V3	"rnorton828 ""rnorton828"""	"Considering the appalling amounts of cinematic slop which Hollywood has splashed across the silver screen for so many years, I have often wondered if anyone in the motion picture industry was capable of producing a film masterpiece which was uplifting to its viewers (let alone willinig to do so). Mel Gibson stepped up and delivered such a film in 2004 with ""The Passion of the Christ."" ""Jesus of Nazareth"" remains my favorite film about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is not about the LIFE and MINISTRY of Jesus, but about His death and the twelve hours leading up to His crucifixion. The story of a God who loved all mankind so much that He sent His only Son to die for our sins so we could be with Him for all eternity is indeed the ""greatest story ever told."" Gibson, drawing from the four gospels of the New Testament, has given us a faithful, lovingly crafted rendering of that story. James Caviezel gives one of the greatest performance of any ""screen Jesus"" I've ever seen (second only, perhaps, to Robert Powell in ""Jesus of Nazareth""). Yes, this film is very bloody, and is probably not suitable for children under thirteen. Yet many of the same media buffoons who have attacked ""The Passion"" for its violence have defended many other movies which are also very violent, but not nearly as uplifting as ""The Passion."" Now, nearly three years after the releaseof the original theatrical cut of the film, Fox is finally releasing the DVD set I've been waiting for--complete with both the original and ""edited"" versions of the movie, plus bonus features including featurettes and several commentary tracks--far superior to the ""vanilla DVD"" release of ""The Passion"" from late 2004.  I hope that ""The Passion of the Christ"" will unstill in many people a passion FOR the Christ."	5.0	The DVD release of The Passion I've been waiting for--with commentaries AND featurettes!	2007-01-26	0	0	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	The Passion of the Christ(released Feb/04)stars,among others,Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ,Maia Morgenstern as Mary,Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene,and Rosalinda Celentano as Satan.It is certainly a passionate movie,in and of itself,and it was Mel Gibson's own personal passion to bring this part of Jesus's life to the screen.One may dicker and debate the esthetics and the manner in which Gibson portrayed His final hours,but there is no denying the emotion this movie creates within each viewer as each filmic minute passes by.The story begins as the leaders of the Jewish Temple in Sanhedrin have sent guards to arrest Jesus in Gethsemane.Jesus is there and confronting temptation straight from the Devil himself.He is dragged and beaten all the way back and brought before the temple leaders and assorted citizens.Some leaders leave in disgust while the others that remain sentence Jesus,for his heresy,to death.The Romans get wind of what is blowing and inform their leader Pilate.Inevitably Jesus is brought before him and he must decide His fate.Pilate obfuscates and sends him to King Herrod for judgement,since Jesus is a Galilean.Herrod meets Jesus but in the end refuses to intervene and Jesus makes the trek back to Pilate.With many attending citizenry and Jewish leaders present,Pilate is put on the spot.Pilate decides to scourge Jesus instead of kill him.Jesus is brutally whipped and his handlers almost kill him until Pilate's second in command intervenes.In this state Jesus is again brought out with another convicted criminal called Barabbas.Pilate asks which one should he set free? They answer Barabbas,and much to his delight Barabbas is set free amongst the crowd.That leaves Jesus,and what to do with him? Pilate is forced into a corner and has no choice but to condemn Jesus to death,by crucifixion.Jesus is forced to carry his own crucifix and it is a brutal and terrifyingly wretched long walk to a mount outside the city.He is hounded every step by his Roman guards,who before the march started,gave Jesus his crown of thorns.We watch as Jesus is tied and nailed to the cross and it is raised up into place.On lookers,including Mary Magdalene,his mother Mary and his brother,watch as Jesus slowly but surely slips into unconsciousness and death.The sky darkens,a wind storm and earth tremors follow.The film ends as Jesus is resurrected and the stone blocking the cave rolls away from the entrance.I found it to be an emotionally draining experience.Gibson portrays each punch,each spit,each nail driven into flesh,each metal tipped whip and on and on,with startling realism.He wanted you to see and imagine just how much Jesus suffered for all of us and exactly what he died for.There is no movie before or since that has portrayed Jesus's final hours in such a graphic manner,and I doubt if there ever will be.Gibson set such a high bar here that it is,for all intents and purposes,out of everyone's reach.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.This version is the newer two disc set which has the recut version on it.Extras abound and are too numerous to fully mention,but include everything from commentary to a myriad of featurettes.This is everything you wanted to know about the Passion and then some.You can debate the religious implications and even the reality of what you see here all you want,but there is no denying its impact.Gibson funded this epic himself and in the process created a one of kind film,in ANY genre.Highly recommended.4 1/2 stars.	4.0	A graphic portrayal of Christ's last few hours on earth.	2013-03-29	2	2	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A43269SYC0H97	Robert Barrera	The visuals are certainly difficult to take in their entirety; whether necessary depends on the viewer. Mel Gibson's point in the film's graphic depiction was to show that Jesus did not simply live and then die. Yes, this seemingly accurate portrayal is quite narrow in scope but the viewer must admit that by the film credits, or even if they are able to see it, The Passion has delivered it's message. Also, Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern deserves an Oscar as Jesus' devotional mother while she holds every ounce of pain and suffering any human soul could bear in her facial expressions.One relevant footnote which occurred in filming the lashing scenes: Jim Caviezel states he nearly passed out when only one of the strands of the whips accidently caught him on unprotected skin.	4.0	Not simply a bloodfest	2013-11-10	1	0	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"The Passion of the Christ (Mel Gibson, 2004)First, let me state for the record my position on the story itself. I am coming into this with the perspective of a non-believer, someone who thinks of the story of Jesus as a myth borrowed from other religions (any book on Mithras will show you parallels to stories that existed long before the supposed time of Jesus, for example). I took the movie as a work of fiction. I'm not sure whether that brought me into it with a predisposition against the film, or with a more jaded eye, or what have you. But what I expected from the film was an ultraviolent piece of, to be short, propaganda.I should have known better, on both counts.The Passion is a profound, deeply moving piece of work. It is also not the violencefest I was expecting given Gibson's warnings to that effect; it was less Flower of Flesh and Blood than it was Saving Private Ryan. The violence is concentrated (in this case, in the final forty-five minutes of the film, from the thirty-nine lashes, with its strong shades of Peter Greenaway's The Baby of Macon, to Jesus' death), but is in most cases more implied, with the aftereffects shown, than it is depicted. In other words, it's more film than it is endurance test. You'll probably want to leave the kids at home, but put your mind at ease. If you can make it through a Schwarzenegger flick, you'll get through this (and if you've seen anything by Takashi Miike or Hideshi Hino, you'll coast through it wondering what all the fuss was about).No need for a plot summary, but just in case: The Passion is a biopic about the final twelve hours of the life of Jesus Christ. Jesus is played by Jim Caviezel (Frequency, The Count of Monte Cristo). I'd always rather thought of him as a second-rate hack, but his performance here is wonderful; rather like Willem Dafoe fifteen years ago, it's likely Caviezel will ride this Oscar-worthy performance into an excellent career. Everyone else in the film is pretty much a supporting actor, but a number of them support quite nicely; special mention should be given to Satan (Rosalinda Cantano, last seen in American cinemas in The Order), who's always creeping around the edges of things looking satisfied with the proceedings, and Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov, a staple in really bad B horror films like Octopus, Alien Hunter, and Python 2), both of whom also have the potential to get into really good movies after this.Much has been made of the film's supposed anti-Semitic content. I'm pretty sure the majority of the people who see this film will come out of it wondering where, exactly, that anti-Semitic content is. The Jews are at best minor characters in this film, with the exception of Caiaphas (Mattia Spragia, also recently seen in The Order), who does most of the shouting. The real bad guys here are the Roman guards. For some reason, though, I haven't heard anyone crowing about anti-Italian discrimination in the movie. Huh. Go figure.Caviezel, Gibson, and executive producer Enzo Sisti (the producers are the guys who take home the Best Picture trophy) are all likely to walk off with Oscars in February 2005, and deservedly so, but they will still have to defeat competition. Where the film is going to lord it over (no pun intended) the rest of the films released in 2004 is in the fields of sound design, cinematography, and makeup. Caviezel spends the last forty-five minutes of the film being beaten into rapid deterioration, and the makeup guys actually manage continuity. (They mess up once at the very beginning of the film, but we'll forgive them for that.) The whole thing is beautifully shot, from opening scene to closing, with incredible attention paid to light and sound details. This is the kind of filmmaking you'd get if Hideo Nakata (Ringu, Chaos) and David Lynch (Twin Peaks) got together and had a kid, who then married the greatest cinematographer on the planet, David Eggby (Mad Max, Pitch Black), and then THEY had a kid. There isn't a mote of light out of place in this movie. Anywhere. There's not a scene over- or underlit, not a sound too loud or too soft. (Another reason to watch this on the big screen; the sound balance here just begs for desecration when it gets transferred to DVD, as happens to so many films.) Simply put, this is the best light and sound work I have ever seen in a film. It's better than Pitch Black, better than Chaos, better (okay, by a nose) than Begotten. This is a movie that will make kids leave the theater and say ""I want to be a cinematographer/sound designer when I grow up."" Yeah, it's that good. The effects are in the realm of those foreign directors whose work is ineligible for nomination here in America, but routinely do work far beyond anything we've seen here: Takashi Miike, T. F. Mous, Hideshi Hino, Hideo Nakata, Kei Fujiwara. These are folks who know gore. They employ the top dogs in the Japanese and Hong Kong film industries to get it. They're going to start calling Christien Tinsley, the head make-up guy from Jim Caviezel, when they start making films in the west. Tinsley may not be a household name now, but he was also the head make-up guy for Eddie Murphy in Nutty Professor II and the overseer of How the Grinch Stole Christmas; expect this guy to be mentioned in the same breath as Tom Savini and Rick Baker within the next few years.In any case, whether you believe the story or not, this is definitely a film to be seen.

The movie depects Christ in such a graphic way that it made me think why this movie didnt get an NC-17 rating.The movie deeply emotional and the audience were filled with tears.  The movie made me pretty sad for a few days but I got my mind off it.  The way Mel Gibson depicts Christ is like he wants to make his point which I think was his main purpose of this film the whole time.  He wanted to depict Christ's cruiseifiction in such a graphic way he pretty much exagerated a little with it too.  If you want to see this movie on your own terms but I suggest the children close there eyes at the end of the film.  The film depicts jesus in the most realistic way which THEY DID!  I will admit that I was almost about to drop a tear in my eye.Wheather you like it or not The passion of the Christ is a very moving and deeply emotional film that most people will be talking about for months, probably years.	4.0	Deeply moving and filled with emotion	2004-03-21	2	1	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A38G64S5VMRI1P	Robert Graves	"Amazon.com won't let us write one-word reviews, but if I could it would be this: Staggering. Mel Gibson, aside from creating the most controversial film ever, has also created a masterpiece. The cinematography, the acting, the casting, the script - I can't imagine how it could have been done better. The cinematic genius that gave us Braveheart permeates The Passion, and the story is exponentially more powerful.The Passion squarely on the last 24 hours in the life of Jesus, played wonderfully by James Caviezel (Count of Monte Cristo). It starts in the Garden of Gethsemane with Jesus weeping and praying, takes us through the ""trial"" and crucifixion, and ends with the resurrection. Gibson brilliantly utilizes flashbacks to show the life of Jesus, giving us insight into why he was condemned, as well as showing his relationship with his mother (Monica Bellucci). This was in fact one of the more powerfully executed elements of the movie. Gibson focuses on Mary, who sadly is often left completely out of the story. By showing us a mother's grief he adds an entirely new aspect, and it brings even more meaning to the horrendous torture that Christ endured.This movie is possibly the most graphically violent film ever produced. Not only is it extremely bloody, but we also see the anguish that Jesus' loved ones go through as it's happening. The brutality escalates, so it's difficult to become numb to it. Gibson doesn't ever linger on one aspect of the torture - to do so would've been gratuitous - but instead shows firsthand the degree to which Christ was tortured, with an intensity previously unheard of.All in all, this is an epic film portraying an epic event in history, perhaps *the* epic event in history - and it's executed flawlessly.Speaking to the controversy surrounding the film, I have some thoughts.Allegedly, according to both the Bible and other historical sources, Jesus was a man who polarized nations. Those who knew of him loved him - or hated him. Something about the character and methods of Jesus had that power during his lifetime and for centuries after. The way that Americans have aligned themselves on either side of this movie makes me believe that Gibson's portrayal is accurate, since we're seeing Jesus again polarize a nation. What is it about Christ, who never picked up a sword to defend himself, that inspires such immediate and powerful hatred? Why do people feel so threatened by a message that speaks of selfless love, so threatened that they need to hurl every insult they can at Gibson for portraying this story in film?The bottom line is that the claims surrounding The Passion, much like the claims surrounding Jesus himself, are entirely false and ungrounded. The Passion is not anti-Jewish in the least - Gibson is portraying a historical event that happened 2000 years ago. If The Passion is anti-Semitic, then Schindler's List is anti-German, Gods and Generals is anti-American, Gladiator is anti-Roman and Pearl Harbor is anti-Japanese. Why aren't we calling for these films to be boycotted, or their producers ousted from Hollywood? I find it sickening that the popular media is allowed to pick which cultural groups are legitimately ""persecuted"" when a film comes out. If Gibson made a movie about the Crusades in which the Christians killed thousands of innocent people, nobody would say a word. You wouldn't see Christians boycotting theaters and nobody in the popular media would be screaming for the end of Gibson's career - even though it's ultimately no different: A portrayal of a historical event in which one race/religion is shown to be the incendiary of a tragedy.And that's what The Passion is - a portrayal of a historical event, based very strictly on the Gospels. I find it interesting that the Jews and politically correct critics are lashing out over anti-Semitism in The Passion - the exact same information has been right there in the Bible, the best-selling book of all time, for almost two thousand years. Should we boycott bookstores that sell it, because the Bible is ""anti-Semitic?"" Jews may not be happy about the fact that their ancestors killed Jesus, but that doesn't mean that portraying it is anti-Jewish, nor does it mean that it shouldn't be portrayed - I think that's called ""censorship."" I felt that Gibson went to extremes to remove any possible anti-Semitism by having a Roman guard stare down his nose at Simon and spit the derogatory, ""Jew,"" at him, thus making the Jews a victim of racism. He also omitted the subtitles in the scene when the Jews were chanting for the blood of Jesus to be on them and their ancestors.I find it both amusing and irritating that with ignorant ease, critics (some on amazon.com) casually state that the movie was ""unrealistic"" and ""a concoction of Gibson's imagination,"" or that this all comes down to ""how Gibson interprets the Gospels."" People, these are not theological issues we're discussing here. How many ways can someone read ""he was scourged"" or ""he was crucified,""? Ninety-nine percent of what's contained in The Passion is objective information gleaned specifically from the Bible and other historical sources that describe the torture methods of the ancient Romans. There is very little room for ""interpretation"" in what Gibson presents. If we were talking about the theology behind what Christ taught, then I would grant you latitude in claiming ""it's all how you interpret it."" But Gibson didn't present this kind of information. We know Christ was tortured, we know the devices used, we know the method and degrees to which those devices were used. What's to ""interpret?""The anti-Semitic claims are meaningless attempts at sounding informed. It's political correctness at its most disgusting heights (or rather, lows). I applaud Gibson for not giving in to the pressures surrounding him, and for making a beautiful film he believes in. Once again we see the passion of Jesus dividing a nation, for nothing more than the telling of truth."	5.0	The Gospel of Mel	2004-02-27	0	0	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AFLTHO3MB4825	Robert J. Willert	"Mel Gibson had the right idea when he considered directing THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. Show people precisely what Jesus had to contend with in his final 12 hours. The brutality is horrific, especially the whipping sequence and the nailing to the cross at the end. Perhaps if the director had spent a little less time on the brutality and more with flashbacks about his life, the film would have earned a 5-star rating.The movie is subtitled, but I can understand why Gibson considered not giving the movie any subtitles at all. Though the film is spoken in Aramic and Latin (mixed with a little Hebrew), PASSION doesn't feel like a foreign film. Gibson has given us a visual film that needs little translation.PASSION is a great film. And it is NOT anti-semetic as many would have you believe. If anything, Gibson makes you believe that the Romans (with the exception of a few) were sadistic fiends. Perhaps many of them were. One exception may have been Pontius Pilate (a fine performance by Hristo Shopov). He comes across as human. He is indeed likeable, and compassionate, willing to try to understand Christ. But his legacy is doomed because of his fear of looking bad in the eyes of Caesar.Other good performances: Rosalinda Celentano as the mysterious Satan (she is cloaked - this really works to the advantage of the character); Luca Lionello as Judas gives a brief but convincing performance as Jesus' betrayer. And Monica Bellucci (Mary Magdalene) and Jesus' mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern) are also effective.But it is James Caviezel who really carries the film. Though his lines are brief throughout (thanks in large part to the intense beatings), it is in his expressions that the actor shines. One note of interest: Caviezel did dislocate his shoulder in one sequence which Gibson chose not to edit (I won't tell you which scene), and he suffered from other minor injuries during the making of the film.The message of this movie is ""Love Thy Neighbor"". Yet both Caviezel and Gibson are currently being accused of anti-semitism by fanatics all over the world (somebody even threw a bucket of lamb's blood at Gibson on the street).But THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is an important film. And Mel Gibson should be commended for the making of this masterful effort, not chastised.I attended a church meeting two weeks back and the ministers all were encouraging their followers to view this ""rated R movie"", and ""to bring your 13 year-old"" (too intense for younger viewers). When I attended the film, there were adults and teenage girls and teenage boys filling up every seat. At the end there was applause and the teenage girls next to me were in tears.This is an important film. But one suggestion. Leave the popcorn and soda at the concession stand. You won't need them."	4.0	Brilliant film, but brutality went a little too far.	2004-03-08	8	3	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AYZRHS2921ANX	"Roberto Gonzalez ""Robriv"""	"I went to see The Passion last night and the experience was life changing.  It was the first time that the movie theater was completely silent during a movie.  You could hear a pin drop while the people were crying in the theater.  I could not help it and cried, sobbing, several times.The scene in which Virgin Mary runs to pick Jesus from the road, after He falls down carrying the cross is amazing.  He falls down and Mary remembers when Jesus used to be a child and she used to run to pick him up when he fell.  Then she gets there and helps Him to stand up and tells Him with her eyes wet:  ""I'm here"".  That was incredibly moving.  Mary's performance is outstanding, so real, so oscar winner worth.  Mel Gibson really did a great job directing this masterpiece.  Madgalene's performance is almost silent but it conveys so much compromise with Jesus and His family.The scene of Jesus playing with his mother, laughing, and throwing water at her face after she helps Him to wash His hands before dinner, is so cute and shows Jesus as a real man, full of God's divinity and full of human nature.According to experts, Jesus was the only man crucified with nails in His hands and feet.  A normal crucifixion did not have nails and criminals used to be tied to the cross with ropes or so and left there to die of hunger and thirst.  Because Jesus' message was one that the government felt threatened by, He was much more abused that any other accused criminal at the time.The movie really brought so much spiritual awakening to me.  I have been in church for a long time but never really understood the pain Jesus went thru for me.  Since last night I feel my heart much more free and have started feeling the grace of God in a much deeper way.I came home with my eyes wet and went to my room to pray, giving Jesus thanks for his inmense love for humanity.  During the movie I prayed with tears as well and told Jesus:  ""Lord, if I do not live my life in Your perfect will, then Your sacrifice for me is in vain.  I am so sorry for all the times I have behaved like I don't know You and for all the times I have done things that do not honor or glorify You and for all the things I have done that have made You feel dissapointed or ashamed of me.  My body is Your temple and I want your Spirit to feel pleased to live within me.  Please forgive me and help me become the person you want me to be"".The character of the devil is definitively different in The Passion.  A beautiful pale woman with the voice of a man, not the manly deep bass voice but the normal voice that any man can have and the tone of the voice is always the same, no real emotion or life.  It seems that Gibson wanted to ilustrate the devil as a being with no real life or emotion as a symbol of spiritual death.  God is the giver of life and the devil is His enemy, so there is no life in the devil.I feel that now, more than ever before, I know God's love.  He loved and loves us so much that His mercy is new everyday.  Our lives should be a tribute to His love.I recommend this movie to everyone.  The movie is violent and there is a lot of blood, but it is only a glimpse of what really happened to Jesus.My respect and admiration to Mel Gibson."	5.0	A life changing experience	2004-02-29	3	3	0

We are from a Catholic family and my wife is deeply devout to the Virgin Mary. Since the beginning of the film, we suffered a lot, given the amount of suffering by Jesus that is showed in the film by the Australian director, who, we heard, also belongs to the Catholic faith.Some people said that the film was obnoxious to the people of Jewish extraction, because Jesus were not be condemned if were not for the Jews who were all the time against Jesus. Others said that the suffering of Christ in the film was much bigger than it really was in reality. My wife, who is always keen on religious matters, says that the film was what is there in the Bible, and that Christ suffered a lot more not less in reality, and that the blame is to visited upon the shoulders of all we, humans, not only on Jews or Romans.To finalize, I would like to congratulate all the film's team and most specially to the people that had the good idea to have Aramaic, Hebraic, and Latin dialogues.	5.0	The suffering of Jesus, no more, no less, a good film.	2004-09-12	13	9	4

Those things which Mel Gibson added to the scriptural accounts only served to enhance them, making them come alive in a new and beautiful way.I was especially touched by the interplay between Jesus and his mother, which gave us the only 'comic relief' of the film when we saw the young adult Jesus and his mother in the carpentry shop.This is truly a must-see film - whether it's the original or the recently trimmed version."	5.0	An astounding experience	2005-03-14	6	5	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1JIPFV4OL520T	Robert Wynkoop	Recently I read a review of The Passion of the Christ which aside from calling it anti-Semitic and showing porno-violence, it made the assertion that Mel Gibson missed the opportunity to demonstrate that it was everyman  who murdered Christ.  The review claimed that by making Annas and Caiaphas, the Jewish high priests, look so evil that we do not see ourselves as crucifying Christ, but cast the blame for Jesus death on those evil Jewish priest, hence by implication, the Jewish people as a whole.Annas and Caiaphas were filthy rich, belonging to the sect of the Sadducees that rejected the work of the supernatural and were in collusion with Rome. These men were just about as corrupt and evil as anyone could be.  Try as one might, few of us have anything in common with these them.  Annas and Caiaphas were evil, corrupt men.  That is not to say they were devoid of any good, but it is obvious from the gospel accounts that these men sought the preservation of their own wealth and position above that of seeking justice.  On the other hand, we see members of the Jewish Senate who saw this execution as a travesty of justice,  we see the Jewish father who helped Jesus carry his cross, and the Jewish women who wailed for Jesus death.  We see the Romans who beat Jesus, humiliated  him and nailed him to the cross. Life is rarely as simply as good guy- bad guy- bad people are capable of doing good things, and good people are capable of doing evil things.Gibson hit the nail right on the head.  Aside from being a fairly accurate account of the gospel story, Gibson did show that everyman was responsible for Christ's death.  From the Roman governor to the Roman soldier, from the Jewish leaders, to the Jewish rabble, from rich person to poor person, from Jew to Gentile- all bear responsibility.  Anti-Semitic?  No way.  Oh, by the way, where are these liberal critics when it comes to denouncing anti-Semitism in socialist Western Europe or in the Moslem mosques who daily cry for the extermination of the Jewish people?  Porno-violence? Give me a break. Since when has any liberal decried either pornography or violence when to supports liberal causes?  I think Gibson hit the nail right on the head.	5.0	Missed opportunity or hitting the nail right on the head?	2004-03-20	15	12	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2K73FDQAY8Z8U	"""robynsdragon3473"""	In the midst of the controversy that surrounds this film, I think it is too easy for people to overlook the importance of the statements made so eloquently by this film.  The emotions that surround religion have made it possible for people to commit the most vile of acts against each other.  This film will make you think, make you cry, even in brief moments chuckle at the humanity of a person that has never quite been human in most minds and hearts.  This is a mistake - Jesus was above all a human being, one that loved more than we have been able to love, believed more than we can believe, and sacrifice all for those who believe in Him.To address some of the largest objections that people have regarding this film: a.  the violence - yes, it is violent, it is bloody and at times horrific, but this violence serves purposes: to remind us that there is a greater purpose in life than self satisfication is just one of the many lessons that can be learned; I cannot help but wonder if those who object to the violence here also object to the other violent films that exist - is this worse than 'the Matrix' or 'X-Men'?  Is the absence of gratuitous sex and foul language  what is causing the objection, or is it the ability of this film to make you look inside yourself and realize your shortcomings that upsets people so?b.  anti-semetic:  there are key pieces of Biblical dialogue removed from this film that would cause even more uproar and these phrases were probably left out because those who don't know the story would be able to use them for even greater criticism.c. the actors and director involved:  many people are focused on what this will do for Jim Caviezel's career or what Mel Gibson thinks he is doing in this type of portrayal of the Passion.  Personally, I did not see Jim Caviezel or think of Mel Gibson during this film(and I am sure people can understand how difficult that must be for a woman to do).  It is not about who acts, who directs, what special effects are used and who makes the most money - if I want to see I film with those ideas in mind I will go to one.  In this case, it was about opening my mind to what was given for me, my family and all the world.The Passion isn't just for Christians to learn from, it is for all people of the world to look to as an idea for the possibilities of life.  You do not need to be Christian to learn from Jesus, just as you do not need to be Muslim to understand the teachings of Muhammad or Jewish to appreciate the significance of Passover... or Buddist...or Hindu...The things we need to remember when viewing this movie or thinking about religious differences is that all views are valid and all persons have a right to feel what they feel.  If you chose to see this film - do so to learn what you can, open your mind, check your preconceived notions at the ticket booth and absorb...In the greatest moments of this film, I learned things about myself and my faith.  I realized that I must feel grateful to Pilate, Judas, and the Jewish leaders for the simple fact that without them, the Mission would not have been fulfilled.  I pray for God to Bless them, for helping His Son to succeed in the greatness He was destined for.  I also learned that I am not worthy, nor never will I be, of the kind of Sacrifice and Love that were given to me by the Passion and the Resurrection.  I am eternally thankful that God saw fit to deliver me from my sin with the generosity of His gift.  I only hope that others will learn from the film whatever lessons they can and try to remember that knowledge is power, and an open mind can destroy all prejudice.	5.0	Lessons Learned and Love Received	2004-03-11	3	2	1

It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love, humanity, and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2 Is it possible for anybody to be truly objective about Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ""? Has any movie ever stirred up this much ""passion"" on both sides of any one issue? For here, indeed, is what might be termed the perfect Rorschach Test film.  As with the famed ink blots, people have a tendency to project onto this film all their innermost beliefs and biases - so much so that, in many cases, the comments individuals make about the film end up saying less about the movie and more about the people themselves.  Devout Christians embrace ""The Passion"" as the ultimate illustration of God's love for humanity, believing that by dramatizing so vividly the physical agony of Christ's last moments on Earth, the film brings home the high cost of the sacrifice in a way it has never been brought home before.  Since film is a largely visual and emotional medium, ""The Passion"" has an advantage - even over the gospel accounts themselves - of being able to convey the unimaginable brutality of 1st Century crucifixions and to make us vicarious participants in the suffering.  So passionately have some Christians taken this film to their bosoms that they have even equated attacks on the film with attacks on God.  On the other side of the cultural spectrum, many nonbelievers and skeptics see the film as a bewildering exercise in sadomasochistic savagery, as a man is basically tortured to death for two hours while millions of viewers worldwide queue up for the privilege of witnessing it.As an agnostic on the issue of Jesus myself, I confess that I can see both points of view fairly clearly, although, on the whole, I think ""The Passion"" is a pretty impressive cinematic achievement.  What makes this film different from most previous versions of the story - even more so than the unprecedented intensity of the movie's violence - is the fact that ""The Passion"" concentrates almost exclusively on the last few hours of Jesus' life.  By showing virtually nothing of Jesus' pre-passion ministry, the film does feel as if it is missing a fairly crucial dimension to the story.  Even the resurrection is treated almost as an afterthought - a bit of a cheat, actually, considering how much suffering both Jesus and the audience have had to endure up to that point.  Gibson attempts to filter bits and pieces of the back story into his movie through the use of very short flashbacks, but anyone unfamiliar with the gospel tale may find himself confused and bewildered and questioning what the purpose of all the suffering really is.  Perhaps unintentionally, the message of Jesus tends to get lost on the blood-soaked road to Calvary.Certainly it is the graphic nature of the violence that will be most remembered about this film and I think, in this respect, Gibson took basically the right approach.  The unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering is infinitely preferable to the sanitized, ""tasteful"" way in which it has been depicted in most previous films on the subject.  It is possible that the director may be guilty of some overkill in this area (do we really need the crow pecking out the thief's eyes while he's dangling on the cross?), but, for the most part, the unremitting brutality is the film's strongest point.  It does lead us into questioning just why a loving god would require such a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, but, then, that is an issue for theologians, not a movie reviewer, to consider.As to the issue of whether or not the film is anti-Semitic in nature, that, too, depends on how one looks at it.  Surely, Jesus and his followers were all Jews and they, needless to say, are portrayed in only the most sympathetic light by the filmmakers.  Unfortunately, Caiphas and the other Jewish leaders in the film have been reduced to little more than stock villains, shaking their fists at the camera and crying irrationally for Jesus' blood all throughout the picture.  However, since this is the way the story is told in the gospels, the charge of anti-Semitism is virtually unavoidable in any movie dealing with Jesus' life.  For the same reason, Pontius Pilate comes across in the film as a much more reasonable, conscience-wracked victim of circumstance than historians like Josephus would ever have portrayed him.One can also question the decision on Gibson's part to add Satan to his cast of characters in the guise of a hooded, hissing, androgynous figure more appropriate to a cheap horror film than a serious drama.  Of course, one can understand why Gibson felt compelled to do this.  After all, by limiting himself solely to the passion scene, he must have realized that he was left with no opportunities to portray any of the neat miracles Jesus is said to have performed.  Thus, the director had to find a way to inject something of the supernatural into the proceedings; otherwise the film might have come across as just a movie about a guy being pounded to a pulp by a bunch of misguided sadists.On a technical level, Gibson has done a superb job recreating the time and place of the story, with his inspired use of Aramaic and Latin lending a harsh reality to the scene.  The makeup work is truly extraordinary and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel brings out the stark beauty of the ancient background against which this gruesome drama is played.  As Jesus, Jim Caviezel cuts an impressive figure and sure shows that he can take a punch with the best of them.  Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Francesco De Vito as Peter and Hristo Jivkov as John get to do little but look teary-eyed and concerned as Jesus makes his way through the crowd.  Hristo Shopov brings some humanity to the role of Pilate, though Luca de Dominicus makes of Herod a mincing, campy caricature.There is a certain irony in the fact that the most commercially successful R-rated feature to date has achieved that prominence largely through the patronage of people who have been the most vocal critics of such films.  Perhaps the Lord does indeed work in mysterious ways.As films about the life of Jesus, I much prefer Passolini`s ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" and Zeffirelli`s ""Jesus of Nazareth"" to Gibson`s ""The Passion of the Christ,"" but this latest version of the tale, despite its many flaws, brings its own unique vision to ""the greatest story ever told."""	3.0	Flawed But Compelling Trip Down the Via Dolorosa	2005-01-20	11	6	5

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2RH7ARWQSUVQV	"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God"""	"This is a good film which closely follows the testimony of the New Testament Gospels.  The filming is graphic and detailed and the decision to have people speak in their original languages was very intelligent.  The film has been accused of being antisemitic--partly because of Gibson's escapades-but I don't see it.  It is no more antisemitic than the Gospels, themselves.  Yes, I think it can be argued that the Gospels show an anti-Pharasee bias--make that an anti-establishment bias--but they can't be antisemitic.  The early Christians, precisely the ones who wrote the New Testament, were all Jews.  It is hardly credible that they were antisemites.  They were, however, members of a new wave of Judaism, a wave that witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the razing of Herod's Temple.  They didn't like the Temple Establishment and their writings show it, sometimes even glossing over the Roman responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion.The film is both detailed and excruciating.  It emphasizes Jesus' suffering for mankind.  It's difficult to 'overdo' something as hideous as death by crucifixion but I think the directors come close.  The scourging is overdone to the point of unbelievability.  It goes on far too long and is laid on with too much force.  The scourging of the type depicted may have killed a man without the necessity of a cross.  Of a near absolute certainty, a man so scourged would never be able to pull--even with help--the cross up to the hill of Golgotha.Other than that I have only one other technical comment and that involves the cross, itself.  The cross has become the living symbol of many Christian faiths but many people believe that there was never a cross.  There is evidence that, in some places, the uprights were always kept in place on the execution ground.  The condemned man carried the crosspiece on his shoulder to the place of execution.In A.D. 70, Jerusalem fell to a Roman army and thousands were crucified around its walls.  It seems highly unlikely that full crosses were used in the executions.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"	4.0	the scourging alone would have killed him	2008-08-21	3	1	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ADKA2MJQQCMTO	Ron Sullivan	"A couple of thoughts:First of all, the fact that the movie was in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew drove me crazy. I really dislike subtitles, I (personally anyway) find them distracting and they tend to force me away from paying attention to other parts of a film that I like to look at.There was no story-telling at all. Now granted, since it made money hand-over-fist, this may be a moot-point in a lot of ways. However, if you were coming from a family that wasn't particularly religious, I couldn't help but think that you'd have no idea who the characters were or what was going on.I had heard people mention that they had thought that `Braveheart' was a warm-up for what Gibson did on TPOTC. I disagree with that on every possible level. `Braveheart' was a better film, and not by a small margin.I had also heard mentioning of ""The Media's"" over-hyping the violence in the film. I didn't think this was at all overstated. If anything, it was more violent then I expected. Now, being such a fan of horror, action, and science-fiction movies, I'm the LAST person in the world to complain about a movie being violent or bloody. I do think though, that it hit a point where the brutality in the movie ceased to have a point in forwarding the story. It almost seemed to be violent, just for the hell of it. Yeah, I know, and then I get to hear the argument ""Well, that was what he really went through."" Well there's a difference between conveying the point that he was tortured and seeing every minute of Christ BEING tortured. I felt (in several instances) that Gibson had made his point and just continued to, visually, beat-up his audience. With a running time of over two hours, you probably very easily could have trimmed about five or ten minutes off and given your audience a little bit more of a mental break.  Although admittedly, is edition of the film does make some of these scenes a little easier ...Monica Bellucci is an OUTSTANDING Italian actress that's given virtually nothing to do.I LOVED the scenes with Mary reflecting back on her life with Christ as a child and a young man, but there aren't NEARLY enough of them. For me, they were the only points where I felt emotionally invested in the movie. Other then that I felt like I was watching a one-legged man in an a$$-kicking contest.I honestly didn't see where the film was anti-Semitic. I thought it was clear that the Jewish hierarchy simply felt that its authority was being usurped and that it was the actions of several individuals in power that started ""the conspiracy against Christ"" (for lack of a better term) and not an indictment of the ENTIRE Jewish faith.  To be fair though, I'm not Jewish.  I might very well feel completely different if my upbringing was that of another faith.As far as being a ""traditionalist"" movie, I didn't think there was enough script to make a judgment. It didn't appear to shoot off in any bizarre directions, and I never found myself saying ""Hey ... that didn't happen like that."" What exactly would a ""non-traditionalist"" film look like?So on the whole maybe two and a half or three stars out of five. It will certainly give people something to talk about (which in of itself probably isn't such a bad thing) but I didn't find myself the least bit moved or fulfilled on a religious level."	3.0	Not Quite the Religious Experience I was Expecting ...	2008-01-11	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	APORF8UOGHSXJ	Rosalie Marschall	I think Mel Gibson accomplished something very important with this film.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AAGFBE5EM7YKB	Roule Duke	Let me be clear straight off of the bat, there is not a single religious bone in my body, I saw this movie mainly because I wanted to see what all the fuss over this, 'life changing experience' was.That said, I think that `The Passion' has taken a very bad rap from the media, for starters the violence is not anywhere near as harsh or disturbing as some have made out. In fact scenes of explicit and detailed violence do not form the bulk of this movie at all which is what I was led to believe upon seeing it called an 'endurance of torturous and grotesque on-screen violence' by some elements of the media. The worst violence is entirely contained in two scenes, a short one where he is tortured first with a caning and then with a cat of nine tails and lastly the crucifixion itself.So from the get go I was a little let down because the movie was not the spectacle I imagined it to be after reading about it. As a whole I found it was in a few words flat, boring, and 'gimmicky' if you catch my drift. Gibson tries to pull your heart strings using every trick in the book, this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't done so clumsily and with the emotion being laid on with a trowel.Coupled with this I felt that the movie didn't have any real message, being someone who has never read the bible and only had a rudimentary knowledge of the story of Jesus I found that there was nowhere near enough detail put into his character. Scenes from his past were few and far between and failed to convey any of the good things he was meant to have done. For instance take the flashback to when he meets Mary Magdalene. We see him crouched on the ground drawing a strange symbol in the sand while a crowd toss rocks onto the ground behind him, he stands up and then a hand reaches out and touches his foot, it is a lady and he helps her up, and that's it. If I had not of been force fed the bible story as a 6 year old in school and thus understood who her character was meant to be I would have had no idea who she was. For a movie that Gibson himself has said is meant to reach out to people who do not believe in Jesus it is very closed. Nowhere do we see any of his teachings or message and someone who did not believe and had no knowledge of the bible story at all would have no idea who this man was or what he is supposed to signify. Regardless of what Gibson says, it is exclusively catered to devout people and that makes it score low for me in the story department.On the technical side of things I was not impressed with the camera work at all, there was just too much use of slow motion. It was turned on almost every time something bad or violent is happening-like a blow from a Roman guard or a gob of spit in the face-to the extent that it simply became monotonous. The music was too overbearing, it contributed largely to the 'gimmicky' feel I mentioned above, it was just so jam packed with emotion that it felt like it was trying too hard. On the other hand though, the special effects were top notch and scathingly realistic. I couldn't help but be impressed with the stark realism of the cat of nine tails biting into Jesus, or the nailing and crucifixion, the movie will undoubtedly shock some people to the core in this respect. The acting was also noteworthy, not that there was much dialog, but the expression and purpose the actors put into their roles sat well with me.This movie has not been controversial simply because of its violence, there is a wide spread belief that it is anti-Semitic. Well I don't think that it is fair to accuse Gibson of being openly anti-Semitic with this film, after all the source material does tell of the Jews as being the people who put Jesus to death and Gibson cannot help who his father is. But I think that where the anti-Semitic view of the film does creep in is in its depiction of the Jews, particularly of the mob of Jews who always seem to follow the council as they take Jesus here and there. The camera continually focuses on them as this mass of dirty and monstrous beings with distorted facial features, toothless mouths and the manner of rabid animals crying and baying for blood. Then it will switch focus to one of his followers or his mother accompanied by Magdalene standing clean cut in the crowd, wearing sorrowful expressions and easy on the eyes. The contrast is so obvious, people labeling him blasphemer = dirty, bedraggled and animal like rabble, family and followers = clean and decent looking people, that's the difference, those on his side look like 'people' the others don't. It is this which I think has laid the movie open to such criticism, as to whether it really is an intentional case of anti-Semitism I will not say, as I am undecided, all that I will say is I can see where such arguments are coming from.The Passion of the Christ in my opinion is not a very good film at all, the acting was good and the special effects top notch, but it is the direction and the way the story is handled which lets it down. I have always thought that a film about Jesus was meant to convey a good message or impart his teachings and what his sacrifice signifies, but such content is absolutely devoid here. The movie is simply a chronicle of capture, suffering and torment, and finally death. It makes me flinch to think that devout parents all over will be taking their children to see this regardless of the rating, because they think that it will teach them something positive.I give it two stars, the first because it is required, the second for the special effects and performances.	2.0	Where's the message?	2004-03-24	10	5	5

Penola	After all of the thousands of words, arguments and heated passions that this movie has inspired since long before its release, it is a real downer to find out, upon viewing it, that it is a crummy movie.  The subject matter -- the final suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ -- could not be more compelling, even for non-believers.  But somehow Mel Gibson has managed to squeeze so much slow-motion blood out of the proceedings, without giving us any context for the character of the actual man, that the story is oddly passionless.  And talk about over the top!  The beatings, mutilations, and general bloodletting are so graphic that they teeter on snuff -- match this with the ridiculous horror-movie images of a slithery he-she as Satan, and you've got what could best be described as a gore-fest.  Yuck.  The two stars are for Jim C., who suffers nobly in a very realistic prosthetic nose, and the cinematography, which is at times lovely.	2.0	GIVE ME A BREAK	2004-03-09	32	10	22

Pichlik ""EWTN fan"""	"First let me start out by saying that I went into this film with the hopes and expectaions that I would like it; long having been a fan of Mel Gibson's and having great respect for what appears to be great devotion to his family.  I was not disappointed.To those who criticize the film for its' graphic violence I really don't know what to say except to remind them and you the reader that this film delivered on that which it promised.  It provided an up close and intimate view of the ""passion"" of the Christ.  This movie is not, and I emphasize NOT the equally great ""The Gospel of John""; this film is meant to literally deal with and portray in vivid reality the passion, or suffering, of Jesus the Christ when he took upon himself the sins of mankind.  Where The Gospel of John is obviously a telling of the story of the teachings of our Savior.The music, the acting the cinematography in this film are all excellent.  The persons' involved in this effort, both in front of and behind the camera did a tremendous job and are to be congratulated.Is the movie anti-semitic?  The answer, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.  Those that wish to be critical of Mr. Gibson will say yes.  Those who do not will say no.  Personally, since I believe that every person born into the world or who ever will be born into the world is responsible for putting Jesus the Christ on the cross I do not see the film as anti-semitic.  To be anti-semitic and to claim to be a Christian would be the greatest of hypocicies; Jesus himself was Jewish and his message was to love one another as he loved us.  Also, as a Catholic I remember our profession of faith that we recite every Sunday; ""He was crucified under Pontius Pilate"".  This means that though there was clearly Jewish heirarchy implicated in Christ's death final authority to authorize His crucifixion rested with Pilate and Roman authority.  The film demonstrates, vividly, the violence of the ancient world; a violence which I might add though sugar-coated by spin doctors and PR shills still exists in our world in far too much abundance.Finally, was this a story which needed to be told?  I answer that question in the affirmative.  The reason I think it was important to make this movie is today's Christian and fence-sitting believer have been fed over the years such waterd-down versions of the passion and the crucifixion that I believe it is a positive thing to be reminded of exactly what our Messiah endured and suffered on our account through no fault of his own.  Additionally, if this film gets even a handful of us to blow the dust off of our far too neglected bibles because we want to know more that in and of itself is a tremendous accomplishment."	5.0	Bold, Stark and Original; in its' own way	2004-02-25	19	15	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1JUYF5D6TFFHB	"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya"""	Mel Gibson's Passion Of The Christ, released on Ash Wednesday, has made millions of dollars, and will perhaps be recognized for some Academy Award or other in next year's Oscars. It is his first director's debut and entirely his film. It has Mel Gibson written all over it. It is a violent film from a master of violent cinema. Mel Gibson, much like Arnold Schwartznegger, is primarily an action star and caters only to male audiences that are fond of blood and guts. He has an obscession and disturbing taste for films dealing with a theatre of blood, intense suffering, and it is disguised as historical films or colorful backdrops of far-off lands-  Braveheart and the earlier Mad Max films confirm this and the spiritual elements and Jesus Christ's messsage of universal love and peace are not expressed in this film. Instead we have yet another Mel Gibson hero being sadistically tortured and nailed on a cross. Mel knew he had a big audience in Christians because they have a large media he could market the film to. Also, despite the accuracy of using Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin, Gibson casts yet again a Caucasian actor in the role of Jesus. Jesus was not white. He was a Jew with Semitic physical features- dark hair, dark eyes, tan or dark skin. And he could not have been that strong or powerfully-built because he was mosly a man of peace in the style of Ghandi and his body deteriorated after the intense Crucifixion. That's all that Gibson showcases- the violent and bloody destruction of Jesus' body but he doesn't even emphasize the soul, the spirit and the transformation that Jesus had in the Ressurection.Where is the real message of the Gospels ? Where is the Glorious Resurrection ? I'm sorry Mr. Gibson. Even as a Christian I can't watch this film. It's not done tastefully and it's an insult to the Gospels. It is soo shocking and graphic that an old lady from Kansas died of a heart attack watching this movie. The movie is merely Mel Gibson's attempt to redeem himself as a lapsed Catholic (he admitted in interviews that he was addicted to alcohol and that he attempted suicide until he married and had kids and returned to his Catholic religion of his youth). It's a good thing that he's a born-again Catholic and that he is trying to be more spiritual, but he is not doing that with this fim. What it all comes down to is making money. That' Hollywood. It's as money-making factory. Mel Gibson may defend his film all he wants and convince himself that it was inspired by God but it's not true. God would not approve of this film. I'm sure he doesn't even want to be reminded of the terrible ordeal his Son went through. Why open up old wounds ? Instead of watching this nightmare, why don't you read the Bible instead or watch movies that have portrayed the Passion Of The Christ with more class. Ben-Hur with Charleton Heston has a fine Passion sequence towards the end of the film and so does The Greatest Story Ever Told.	5.0	Better Passion Movies Have Been Made	2004-03-07	5	2	3

And the killing of Jesus is not the first killing of this kind. Remember Salome? (Matthew 14:6-12):""But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother she said, ""Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."" And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.""What was John striving for?Again Matthew (3:1-3):""In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, ""Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"".People can spend hours talking about Jesus, the movie, about Christianity, but they somehow forget (avoid?) the centerpiece of Jesus'message: ""Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand""."	5.0	Call for repentance	2004-10-23	17	9	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A17CBOQ2S46E3C	"Russell Pollard ""Russell Pollard"""	"I am not a Christian but acknowledge that Jesus Christ and his followers have had and continue to have a profound influence on my life, in fact on all our lives. I was therefore really keen to watch this film that dealt with one of the most central acts of this often told life -  the actual moments of our redemption. I have never understood what this ""redemption"" business is about - what it is from or what it leads to, and I have always failed to see any logic at all in the view that someone's suffering and death could in some bizarre way be the trigger required to achieve it.So my interest was piqued by what this film might offer and by some one the more enthusiastic reviews I had read and heard about it.Well, I have seen a lot of pain and suffering in my time - as have we all if our eyes are open to it - and this was something else entirely. This was fantasy terror, sadomasochism with Hollywood lighting, the inflicting of horrific injuries that would close down or paralyze any human nervous system. One of the points of the Jesus Christ story is that he is supposed to have been a man - a real mortal flesh and blood, thinking, feeling man. Well the stoic masochist in this film was no mortal man. With injuries that would have felled a shrieking elephant, injuries that would have caused everything from hemorrhage to brain damage, he quietly and thoughtfully staggers on his holy way even offering the occasional smart remark to bystanders.This film was just another spectacular portrayal of one of history's most lucrative brands. I realized when it had finished that I had wanted to feel something genuine and authentic, to have some glimmer of understanding about this whole business of suffering as a ticket to good things in the next life. Instead I was almost numbed by its portrayal - if not downright betrayal - of a life well lived, a life that challenged pomposity, a life that offered solace to the poor, kindness and acceptance to so many people who were considered unworthy by those who held religious power, and a life that was finally squashed and scourged and murdered by the religious power brokers of his dayIf Christ's passion was as full on as the scriptures tell us then Mel Gibson's understanding of passion [as suffering] is less than ordinary. It is truly one dimensional, myopic and what you would expect from someone who is so certain and self-satisfied about their world view, that they cannot see the reality and the suffering and the prejudice and the hatred and the bitterness and the cruelty that Jesus Christ, I sometimes think, understood and indeed experienced.Physical suffering is graphic no doubt but it also provokes real responses like fear and cries of anguish. Surely there was far more to the passion of Jesus Christ - a passion that captured the suffering of the entire world - and the Gibson film connected with none of it. Humiliation and ostracism, being the outcast or the sinner, the epileptic or the leper, the shunned man or the shamed woman, or even the gay man or the incarcerated black American in today's terms, are clearly things that Jesus understood and about which Mel Gibson has absolutely no idea. The passion of Jesus Christ was as much the pain of his rejection by his own, the shame and fear and helplessness he brought to his own mother and those he loved and cared about - to the point that they were not even prepared to be associated with him. Gibson portrays this denial of connection as some kind of fear of physical harm. The fact that it takes courage to stand up and stand out, to be associated with those upon whom the crowd has turned, was as much a part of Peter's fear filled denial of Christ as any fear of being physically harmed.The film just doesn't get it at even the most basic level. Christ was humiliated. He was outcast. He was betrayed by people he would apparently do anything for. His clothes were stripped from him and he was mocked cruelly - the crown of thorns, the sign above him on the cross - all of it as much about mockery and ridicule as it was about the excruciating physical pain he had to endure like a cur in front of - and if we are to believe him, at the hands of - those he actually loved.Has Gibson any understanding of what it might be like to be beaten and broken by those you love - really, honestly love. I suspect that Gibson probably sees nudity as a sexual thing - which of course it often is - and viewers have had the Gibson anatomy pretty much in our faces over the years - but he is seemingly too squeamish to let us see Christ stripped bare, degraded, mocked and totally humiliated. We are also spared the kind of choking tears and heart-rending sense of hopelessness that racked the very being of Christ as he - he who ostensibly would have known so much - begged his so called father to be spared, a father who could not be convinced to let this particular chalice pass. This is the passion of abandonment.The power of a real man reduced to the basest suffering, reduced to the sum of all our suffering, is not to be found in this mawkish film. This is a film for those who like their Christianity white, piously respectable and physical. The fact that so many desperate people have lauded this film, watched and re-watched it, speaks volumes of the intellectual poverty and deep-felt craving which exist among so many modern Christians - their need to have something to pin their increasingly strident and intolerant beliefs upon. You just have to ask ""What is the agenda for this film? What on earth is Gibson's brutal physical reductionism leading to?""The world is increasingly dominated by the new evangelical Christians, and the old traditional fundamentalists, with their noses found deeply in the trough of the world's ""abundance"", insensitive to the costs paid by suffering people everywhere for the greed and bigotry of essentially industrialized Christian nations.  Christ is often portrayed in the world's media and many of its televised churches, as if he were some kind of cheerleader for the American military-industrial complex as it crusades to crush all serious opposition once and for all. This film will suit that American mood - or that foul part of it that likes its Christianity muscular. It is as warlike and violent and macho and unthinking as any film you will see. And it has almost become unpatriotic to give it a thumbs down. If you are looking for the man who loved and saved the world you will not find him here. Perhaps no film could ever fully tell the story of Christ. This one doesn't even manage to retell one of the most central parts of it."	1.0	A morbid and brutal apologia for muscular Christianity	2004-11-17	125	65	60
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A31JR5HCIPY9H8	Rusty L	"This great movie on the 5 Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary (The Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, The Scourging at the Pillar, The Crowning with Thorns, The Carrying of the Cross and The Crucifixion) and the first of the 5 Glorious Mysteries of the Rosary (The Resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday) is a true gem.  The crime is that the so-called ""powers that be"" in Hollywood and the secular media continue to victimize the major players in this film including Mel Gibson (the producer) and Jim Caviezel (who starred as Jesus of Nazareth).  In his own words, Hollywood has ruined the acting career of Jim Caviezel.  Gibson has had problems with adultery, divorce, drinking, public outbursts and alleged domestic violence (the latter by his former mistress), but then to judge him harshly on these counts would be to ignore the so-called ""norm"" of Hollywood's extremely low moral fiber.  Very many in the entertainment industry are even worse than Gibson when it comes to this.  The Passion of the Christ is by no means more violent than much of what leaves Hollywood.  The difference is that The Passion of the Christ portrays something entirely factual, whereas much of what comes out of modern Hollywood is wanton violence (not to mention wanton sex and utter moral depravity).  The Passion of the Christ is a very powerful film largely in ancient Aramaic and subtitled in English.  This quality makes the film even more poignant.  It is a shame that modern media, government and industry have little to no respect for the timeless Judeo-Christian faith, tradition and heritage of 3.6 billion Christians, Muslims and Jews who comprise the majority of humanity."	5.0	A GREAT FILM	2011-05-11	5	3	2

This movie is one of the few movies that I was about ready to cry watching it.  Mel Gibson did a very fine job showing what Jesus did for his people.  This movie actuly scared me in some scenes which added to its value.  This is one of the few films also that when I got up to leave the theater, I look around and half the audience is still sitting in there seats, looking blankly at the screen.

This movie brought me to a drastic realization that Christ did not simply, for lack of a better phrase, drop dead, but instead went through enormous pain and suffering because of my personal sin.I once heard that even had I been the only one who Christ was trying to save, he still would have gone to the cross for just me. This movie really helped me put the entire aspect of his crucifixion into a real perspective and gave me a new amount of respect and understanding for what Jesus's act meant for me in my life."	5.0	Pleased with film	2004-09-18	7	4	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ABD13AA2BLJGZ	"S8472 ""S8472 Resistance is Futile"""	"Ben said in his review that it was Hypocritical and blasphemous.  Being that he is not a christian I think he might have missed the reason that this film was such a success even though it was very bloody.  I bought this film when it came out on dvd several years ago and had my parents who are christians come to my house to watch it.  My mother had to leave half way thru the film.  My father and I finished watching it.  I made the comment to my mother that if Jesus had been able to go thru all that pain and suffering for me..yes for ME!, then I could at least sit thru this film and watch what he had to go thru.I have watched many ""Jesus"" films in my life, but none have truly made me stop and think of the horrible suffering and pain that the son of God had to actually go thru to pay for my sins and the sins of this world, until I watched ""The Passion of the Christ"". I think to view this film as the aforementioned reviewer did, with contempt and scorn, because it happened to be symptomatically in league with todays horror films of gore, is sad.  Only because he missed the whole point of the film and has yet to see what truly happened in these historical events.  Christians flocked to this film because they have now truly seen the pain that Christ went thru to save them from their sins and the wrath of God to come, which has been revealed to us in the book of revelations."	5.0	makes you think....	2007-04-08	11	9	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A29CUCGRX04TS8	Sailoil	I waited to see this movie, because I wanted to judge it with cold dispassionate eyes free of the hype and the controversy that surrounded its release.I grew up in a Catholic Church where the suffering of Jesus was a palpable, in your face reminder of his sacrifice for our sins.  It is not a paradigm I ever appreciated wholly.  As kids we would perform the stations of the cross, following the little plaques around the church, which depict the scenes from the Passion.Mel Gibson has taken the ritual of the stations, or the notion of the passion play, and he has brought it into sharp focus with this movie.  His depiction of the last hours of Jesus's life is brutal, graphic, bloody and gruesome, and yet it is not gratuitous in any way, shape or form.  At no stage does the violence detract from the power of the central message, that Jesus died for us, that we could live in heaven.I don't know the impact of this movie on non Christians, but I can say that for a Christian it is a moving, indeed gut wrenching, reaffirmation of the basic tenet of our faith.  It transports you back to a time of childhood innocence when belief in the life and works of Jesus were unquestioned and freely accepted.  As such it succeeds wonderfully as a messianic revival of the Faith.Artistically it is beautifully filmed in a sensitive manner that involves the viewer as part of the on-screen audience.  The use of Aramaic and Latin are inspired choices, as was the selection of Italian speakers for the Latin.  I was worried that it would sound like Oxbridge Latin with english public school pronounciation, and was pleasently surprised that it didn't.As for the supposed controversy over anti-semitism - I don't get it.  Perhaps I am not sensitive to it.  But it seemed to me no more than a simple depiction of a power struggle between the Saducee Temple Hierarchy and a troublemaker who needed to be removed.  Herod might have been a bit over the top, but I don't know, I must read the biblical passage and judge that one myself.  I felt the release of Barabas was handled excellently with just the right level of conflict shown by the Church Elders for what they were doing.I believe this is a film that will stand on its merits for many many years.	5.0	Timeless Cinema, a triumph of hearfelt faith.	2006-06-12	22	14	8

Having heard how it had been a transformational experience for some, I rather expected something more profound than this.  I found it expressionistic but in a totally hamfisted way.  There's no doubt that most Christian religions tend to sterilize the memory of what was by all accounts a brutal torture, and this movie at least serves to make the viewer remember.  That's fine.  It's important, to a Christian, to try to go right there.  Every Good Friday, since I was a child I have very slowly counted out and thought about the 39 Lashes.  But the scourging portrayed here is so overdone that it is almost comical.In sum, I just can't account for the almost pornographic fixation on torture, suffering and blood.  What's the point?  It serves no particular purpose.Given the movie's supposed fixation on retelling it ""as it was"", little details bugged me.  It's fairly well established that Christ carried only the pantabulum, or cross-piece, to the cross, not the entire thing (which would have weighed ~350 pounds) -- the uprights having been already set in the ground.  It's fairly well established that those unfortunates who were nailed to crosses had nails through their wrists rather than their palms.  In Mel's movie, the height of the cross increases drastically as the movie goes on -- the high cross at the end is a good 4-6 feet higher than what they show Jesus carrying out of Jerusalem!!!  The water that gushes out when Jesus is prodded with a spear -- it is reasonably well settled by medical experts that a bit of water _can_ in fact collect in the body in extreme duress such as this -- but the cheesy unnatural animation in the movie was altogether 1930s in feel.  And in none of the four Gospels is there the slightest mention of the Devil, or a snake, in the Garden of Gethsemane -- that's purely a Gibson conceit.The actors are utterly cartoonish.  Not one personality was developed beyond the level of caricature.  There's a slight hint at the complexity of Pilate's character.It seems absolutely bizarre to me that ""The Passion"" was so successful.  I cannot think of a single thing about it to recommend to others.  There have been many, many, many more profound retellings of this amazing story.  Retellings that leave the viewer inspired, or angry, or sad, or amazed, or touched.  This just left me empty."	1.0	Why this?  Why now?  No stars.	2005-06-18	49	24	25
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1MOXJOSJ6A2KW	Sam's-Review	The greatest story ever told. This particular version is realistic, very bloody, and violent. I do not recommend this for kids. You may NOT want your kids to view this version; the older versions are more suitable for kids, like (King of Kings or Jesus of Nazareth-1977). The cinematography, sets, period wardrobe, acting, and sound are all stunning. The only problem is that this movie is not filmed in English, you will have to select English subtitle. This movie is done in the true language or close to the true language of the time. That&#8217;s a major Negative in this movie and Mel Gibson should have known better than that! Otherwise this is a great movie, recommended on Blue Ray only of course!  Please don&#8217;t  be put off by the fact that you will have to read English subtitles as this movie is filmed in a way that you almost don&#8217;t need to read anything, as you will understand what&#8217;s  going on especially if you already know the greatest story ever told about our lord Jesus Christ.

If you are seeking deception, and make up your mind before truly examining any work, you will find yourself in deception. However, if you seek the truth, you will find it. To those who are making controversy of this film, I would challenge you to truly ponder where faith comes from and why the sacrifice of Jesus is so powerful to so many. This movie is not meant to entertain, to soothe or to reinforce.. it is meant to provoke. It reveals that nothing has come to us free of charge; all gifts were bought at a price by someone.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3IRV5T46Y9ZAD	Sarah B. Chalk	"I am amazed at many of the reviews that have been written regarding this film. Some viewers went to see it because of all the controversy surrounding it, not even realizing the intense depth of the film, or caring for that matter. Jesus who? This film, truly one of the few necessary films ever made, is so much more than so many realize. GOD used Mel Gibson as a VESSEL for His glory. All of us are put on this earth for one reason...to glorify God. Many don't realize, care or even acknowledge that as being their reason, and they do everything in their power to go against that purpose. The Passion of the Christ is an extremely accurate RE-ENACTMENT of the crucifixion of Christ. I often wonder how the world could have been worse during Noah's day than it is now, so despicable that God would want to destroy His creation with a flood. Today's world is beyond depraved. Surely, God is saddened. People have forgotten about Jesus and His love. None of us are worthy of Jesus' sacrifice, but this film isn't about that aspect. It is about grace. Grace, simply defined, is this...Love that we don't deserve. All of those reviewers typing words of negativity regarding this Holy Spirit inspired piece of film, should consider that their words are a blasphemy to God. If the violence is difficult to watch, the bloody images haunting and nightmare-provoking...they should be. How can the crucifixion be candy-coated?. Watch with open eyes what all of us are responsible for. Is it so difficult to watch for those writing, complaining about the violence, because they know WE put Him there? The HELL suffered for all of us, was the greatest gift of love ever given. Jesus DIED for each and every one of us. This movie is not a ""feel good"" movie in the fact that most people probably left the theater feeling depressed. As the hot tears stung my face while I watched the film, my calloused heart felt joy that God really does love me, so much that he sent His beloved Son, Jesus to die for me. I oft times cannot comprehend He would love each and every one of us that much. To put this in terms many might be able to relate to...How would many of us feel watching our earthly fathers being tortured and crucified, guilty only of love for us, their children?

Okay, this film is JUST a film, but God used it to give us a glimpse with our eyes of what happened on that hill called Golgotha. We have His Holy Word. The facts are written.

They weren't a bloodbath, yet kept you enthralled with good pacing and editing.  Those films were perfectly adequate and conveyed the message of Jeseus.The Passion, however, hardly said anything of his life or teachings; they assumed that you knew all about him, and just focused on depicting his death.  So if anyone wants to watch Christ get whipped senseless, scouged 100 times, and beaten to a bloody pulp, see this movie right away.	2.0	It could, and would have been very powerful...	2004-04-30	15	3	12
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2S6UVLBE48EY2	Sara Williams	I was very happy to hear that Mel Gibson was working on this film. I must say that the casting, (Jim Caviezel was wonderful-perfect demeaner and humility) scenery, and costuming was top notch.Jesus Christ is my personal Savior, and I am so thankful for His tremendous life sacrifice for my sins. He is my Prophet, Priest and King, and  He endured grief and pain beyond any of our imaginations, in order that He could be that sacrificial Lamb .The Bible, God's Holy Word, is the perfect script. So, I was disappointed that Mel couldn't stick to it 100%. My first thought after viewing the movie was that it was incomplete. It doesn't show clearly enough the glorious ressurection of my Savior. I realize that this was not the focus of the film, but if there could have been just a few more minutes, and maybe a ressurected body and an angel of the Lord?The one thing that disturbed me the most was the liberties that were taken in representing evil. When I read the Gospels, I do not picture Satan having such a role. I know that he entered Judas Iscariot, and sifted Peter like wheat, but I don't think he was there as such a tormenter throughout. He should be given as little credit as possible, as Christ's suffering was done in accordance with God the Father's perfect will. (Not Satan) The demonic images portrayed were disconcerting to me personally, and I pray that in time they will leave my mind. I can honestly say I will never forget seeing this movie. It does have a deep impact.	4.0	Sobering, yet also disturbing	2004-03-03	5	2	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3JEILJ79EDN6V	Sardaukar Commander	"Let's step back, put aside the religious debate for a second, and acknowledge that ""Passion of the Christ"" is a milestone in mainstream cinema.I sat down with ""Passion"" ready to sneer, laugh, and belittle. Granted, when the credits rolled I was laughing, but not for the reason you think.Think about it!What director and actor Mel Gibson (""Braveheart"") has done is nothing short of mesmerizing and laudable: he has pulled together what amounts to a TWO HOUR snuff film involving no less than Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Mystery made Flesh, the King of Kings, Emmanuel, meaning ""God is with Us"".Think about that for a second. I'll be here when you get back. Seriously, it takes wee kegs of steel to make a snuff film with JC.Awright, for those who don't know, ""Passion"" is all about the final 12 hours of JC, referred to as the ""Stations of the Cross"" by Catholics: we follow Jesus from Gethsemane, where he's praying (wait...he's God...who is he praying to? I'm confused...nah, never mind) all the way to Golgotha, and on the way JC does a whole heap of dying.I'm not kidding. That's what the film is about. Now, I know a ton of Christians---including Mel---who will argue until they're blue in the face that this is about Christ's suffering, and what He did for us. And yeah, for sure, it's about his suffering, alright. But that doesn't quite grasp the nature of the beast, if you'll allow me the license.It's not about the message of Christ. It's not about belief. It's not about miracles, or God, or mercy---it's about a 1st century AD Jew being folded, spindled, and mutilated by the Romans and their Jewish subjects---and when they get done folding, spindling, and mutiliating him, mind ya, they're just getting going.You've got beating, gouging, flaying alive, flesh ripping, spear-thrusting, thorn of crowns head ripping! And to top it off, when the blood can't run any thicker or redder, the Romans get bored and nail JC to the cross. Sissies.Now, I'm an action guy, so this is where ""Passion"" lost a star. I got tired of the sissy Romans and Pharisees picking on Jesus. After a while, you think---if there is a God, a *just* God, he would give his Son full permission to jump down off the Cross and do a little ""Raiders of the Last Arc"" number on his executioners. But no, doesn't happen, no spoiler here---we don't get a happy ending; JC believed in peace, which is why I ain't a Christian.What we *do* get, though, is gore. Oh, and gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel (who did the camera-work for ""Being There"" and ""The Patriot"", among many other flicks), solid acting by all the players (James Caviezel as JC made me actually *want* to believe), including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, the whore. That was a stretch for her, I'm sure. Oh, and we get Latin and Aramaic as the *only* languages available (don't worry morons, subtitles). Sweet.In the end, twisted, unwashed, heathen, stinking unbeliever that I am, I sorta enjoyed ""Passion of the Christ"". I'm big into gore: I love splatter, love the sicko films of H.G. Lewis, love the Japanese gore ""Guinea Pig"" flicks, you name it. Basically, this was a snuff/gore/splatter flick with the Son of God as its subject, which, again---well, that's pretty ballsy, Mr. Gibson!We don't get the Resurrection (think of the Special Effects on that one, baby!). We don't get any sex scenes, which at least Martin Scorcese threw into his JC film. We also don't get any cool battle scenes, but I guess that's to be expected (someone---Ah-nold, mebbe? or Stallone?---should have shown up to rescue Jesus). Anyway, this film is like life: raw, brutal, nasty, pathetic, ultimately pointless. But it's still worth checking out, cochise, if only to see how a true Man (JC) faces death. You'd whine and cry like a baby. He didn't. Street creds, man.It also helped that I saw ""Passion"" as a double feature with ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004 remake). Seeing the one after the other made it seem like, you know, a sequel. We didn't get the Resurrection, but Christ *does* rise from the Dead, and so by the time 2004 rolled around, everyone was infected. In that light, JC was the O.Z. (Original Zombie).Peace out, dawgz."	4.0	Good God, Y'all	2005-02-03	12	0	12

Also like  many  Christians out there, I felt prompted to see this film because I am sick and tired of the secular anti-Christian media attacking my faith and the people who practice it.  I felt that the movie was being un fairly maligned. Until I sat down to watch it and saw that almost every criticism leveled against it was valid.This is far and away the worst ""Christian"" movie I have seen since Priest back in the 90's. It gives a poor representation of what Christ was about.  I agree that Mel Gibson is totally within his rights to make a movie about the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus.  But as a film maker and an artist he is also within his rights to give a preamble or place the film in a context more easy for the audience to understand.  But there was none.The movie seemed to have less to do with the ""sufferering"" of Christ. Than it had to do with human cruelty and sadism.  I have no idea why there was so much focus on the mean spiritedness and manipulations of the Jewish high priests.  And the constant emphasis on the sadistic pleasure that the Roman soldiers took on inflicting pain on Jesus made me sick to my stomach and very angry.As to the charges of anti Semitism.  I don't think that anyone in this film got off looking good. Including Jesus himself.*The mob of people reminded me of the Klingons on Star Trek.*The High priests reminded me of corrupt religious leaders who were more intent on serving themselves than God.*The Roman soldiers came across as neaderthal cave men.Pontius Pilot was a coward.*Jesus himself looked like a poor pitiful man, without any sense of dignity.This film did not ""strengthen"" my faith. It made me feel horrified and embarrassed.I was so horrified in fact that I walked out on it.The only thing I enjoyed in this movie were the flashbacks. If Gibson had included more of these scenes. Or even expounded upon them (like the one where he reaches out to the fallen woman-played by Monica Bellucci) It would have vastly improved the film.  I am not squeamish and am not adverse to violence in movies.  And yes I know the effects that crucifixion has on the body (which was why the Romans used it to as a way of keeping the masses in check) But the violence that takes place in this film is not only excessive. It is as if the film makers took a  sadistic pleasure out of it.If you want to see a good movie on the life of Christ and what he was all about,  and the impact he has had on  the lives of billions of people over the last two thousand years.  I suggest that you see ""Jesus, the Greatest Story of All Time"", starring Jeremy Sisto in the role of Christ.

I bought tickets a week in advance, wanting to see it on ash wednesday, and wanting to take my husband before bad reviews discouraged him from going. Some of the reviews from trusted sources who had seen early screenings, prepared my husband. Recent Bible study, prepared me. It was graphic, especially the scourging, but I expected worse knowing how the hooks on the leather strips could rip flesh away. The glimpses back that jesus, mary, and the others.. reminded us why this had to happen. I feel it was cast perfect. I was uncomfortable with the sound of the language..just at first, and was glad to read the subtitles. It made more of an impression in my heart to read the words...we've read so many times before. I was not expecting Mel Gibson to attempt to introduce the ever presence of spiritual warfare, and the enemy. Even some Christians prefer not to hear this truth. When I saw the enemy always there at every low moment.. ready to discourage... I thought of the pre-release bad reviews. I felt his presence trying to discourage me yesterday morning..and others from going to see a movie that presented the truth of what Christ did for each of us. There was no blame on any one group of people. It could not have happened without God allowing it. He took our punishment even before we commit our sins. Critics focus on the things that were in the movie, but not in scripture. Studying the last days of Christ, one was very aware that some of the details were not in scripture, but none of that added to or took away from 'the truth'. The things Mary did, a mother would do. She knew from the beginning this would happen to her son. One could not criticize any character.. not knowing really what we would do if we had been there..even now we sometimes look away..prefer not to face what happened because of our sins. I would recommend that every one that can, see the movie. Some are too young, too old or weak and should not go. Parents should view it before they sign a release form, and prepare their children. Have a friend read a review that discusses the cruelty Christ endured. For most of us, reciting a creed each sunday, it all had been condensed into one word. 'Crucified'. We need to really know WHAT that is.. to realize what he did because of his love for us. If even one person has a closer relatioship with Christ after seeing this movie, iI feel one day Gibson will hear from his Lord the words 'well done.."""	5.0	an experience never to forget	2004-03-06	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3OPCQYY5JM2TJ	"S B ""sdb70"""	"'The Passion of the Christ' is a violent movie depicting the horrendous last 12 hours of the life of Jesus.  In the theater I was in, the couple to my left walked out at about 55 minutes into the film; but the couple to my right (with children in tow) cried during the last hour, but stayed nonetheless.  This experience instructs my review.For non-Christians (of which I am one), this film could easily come across as nothing more than an exercise in ultra-violence.  (In fact, I heard one reviewer on NPR compare it to 'Clockwork Orange.')  For Christians, however, it is more, especially for those Catholics who grew up walking the stations of the cross at lent (of which I was one).  That is, the film is an affirmative, dramatized contemplation of Jesus' crucifiction.The most prevelant criticism (most scathingly delivered by the New York Times) is that this film's focus on this violent end of Jesus' life demeans his teachings of love and peace, and as such, renders the film utterly inaccessible.  I agree - but only with regard to non-Christians.  To be sure, Jesus' teachings are important, but many of those same concepts are contained in the canons of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and even secular humanism.  Indeed, there is only ONE fundamental aspect that distinguishes Christianity from these other religions and philosophies - the belief that Jesus, as part-God and part-man, chose to suffer immensely to save all of us from original sin.  As un-politically correct as Christianity is in this day and age, I applaud Mel Gibson for this unapologetic expression of the end of the life of his Christ.  Nonetheless, the film will likely appeal only to Christians.What is most regrettable about this film is the other critism taht the film places the blame for Jesus' death primarily on the Jews.  First of all, considering that the gospel of Matthew contains a clause where the Jew place the blood of Jesus' on their OWN hands (which has been removed from the subtitles of this film), I found that the film is not more anti-Semetic than the source material.  What this film does portray is a FEW (not ALL) Jewish elders taking it upon themselves to make sure Jesus, a threat to their political/spiritual influence, dies quickly and without much consideration.  As for claims that Mel Gibson put an anti-Semetic spin on the story, in the scene where the Pharisees gathered, for every moment with angry Jew seeking the blood of Jesus, there is equal time devoted to the efforts of a sadistic Roman, the dissention of a Jewish elder for not convening the full counsil before deciding upon Jesus' fat, or a poignant moment with a compassionate (Jewish) Veronica or Simon.If you are a Jew or a Muslim, you SHOULD take issue with the accuracy of the scriptures and the very notion that Jesus was THE Messiah, and I believe THAT would be a worthwile debate.  But THIS is a film by a Christian, for a Christian audience.  Attacking a FILM as an ""irresponsible"" action in light of a minority of anti-Semetic individuals (who will find a reason to hate Jews without a film) and comparing a FILM to institutional atrocities committed by Christians over the last several centuries is intellectually dishonest, if not perversely thin-skinned.  For the vast majority of Christians, blame is not a fundamental tenant of Christianity.  What Christians ARE taught, which is emphasized in this film is that Jesus made a free choice to accept a foreseen fate.  (For example, note the scene where Pilate asks Jesus if he has any defense for himself.)  Put another way, it is irrelevant to the vast majority of Christians whether and to what extent the Romans or the Jewish elders were responsible.  To Christians, the choice was with Jesus, he made the choice, and he paid the price for that choice - that is ALL this film is about.  Nothing more, nothing less.To the Jewish groups who demanded that Mel Gibson make 26 pages of script changes (that were not made), I say, ""It's not all about you!""  I applaud Mel Gibson for making this FILM with such an inspired and unrelenting purpose - that is what art is all about."	5.0	Required for Christians - others are not likely to	2004-03-01	1	1	0

It reminded me of a Playstation or XBOX game come to life in the screen.Jesus was a subversive a revolutionary, He wanted you to know his Father and what the Word of God means, and how one conducts himself in the beauty of one's faith. For a deeper understanding of what I am talking about please see Pasolini's ""The Gospel According to St.Matthew"". There all the Hollywood buzz,hype,blitz, zizztz is removed. This is a film from the early Sixties and Pasolini was quite brave to make it, portraying Jesus as a revolutionary, and giving one something to think about.

Unfortunately, there are many naive people who are claiming that the movie is accurate or truthful. The movie basically portrays the typical ideas that Christians attribute to Jesus, even though every historian (even ones with a Christian background) claim that a significant amount attributed to Jesus by Christians is conjecture.This movie is based on books (the New Testament) written decades after Jesus left by unknown authors who never even witnessed what happened!  Not only do the accounts in these books contradict one another if you study them closely, but they make no logical sense.  For example, why would God need to have an innocent man's blood poured before being able to forgive?  (By the way, that man is also assumed to be God's son, who also happens to be God, because that's the only way some people can claim they are monotheists even though they worship more than one being).  Also, if believing that Jesus died for our sins is the purpose of our existence, then why did God even give us the ability to think and make moral choices if all he cares about is the ""pure sacrifice"" of an innocent man? It's a great fairy tale to make people think they won't be held accountable for making immoral decisions rather than emphasizing the need to grow or learn from their mistakes.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AYGZP7UYU5IYW	Scarlett	When this movie was released in theatres, I went to see it because I loved Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar.&quot; Since both the musical and the movie center around the same topic, Jesus's death, I figured that I would be able to enjoy it as much as the musical. I still love &quot;JCS,&quot; but this movie has much more emotional impact.When experiencing the movie (because it definitely is an experience), you hardly even realize that you're reading subtitles the whole time. Instead, you feel as if you're a spectator helplessly watching the story unravel before your very eyes. It IS very visual and gory, but I think that it is used appropriately, since the Scriptures tell us that that is what basically happened.I think this is an awesome movie, for Christians and non-Christians alike. However, I think &quot;The Passion&quot; would have made an excellent a sequel to a movie that takes place before Jesus' death. &quot;The Passion&quot; could have used a better explanation of who he was as a person along with his impact on the people who heard him. Some scenes in the movie, such as the blurb of the &quot;stoning&quot; scene with Mary Magdalene, made sense only to those who were familiar with the Bible. I think if Gibson would be up to it, he could make this film to give a more well-rounded perspective on Jesus Christ. But, &quot;The Passion&quot; is, and always will be, an awesome movie.Watch this movie. It is definitely a powerful film, and an experience that will last with you. And don't believe the anti-Semitic junk that you've heard.

Now it's no longer a sin issue, but instead it's a Christ issue: do I accept Him as my personal Savior or do I reject His finished work on the cross?Yes, the portrayal is brutal and it's a bloody affair, but that's how it was and Christ's blood was shed to pay the high price for all of our sins to redeem us and provide Eternal Life for whosoever believes in Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.The film is in the original languages which adds to the effectiveness of this film and with the combination of the vivid images Mel Gibson seems to bring the attentive viewer to the actual places as if a bystander at the events. Much attention has been given to all the details and it's a motion picture for the whole family. Aside from the true historic events, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a tremendous cinematic achievement.We can thank Mel Gibson for going out by faith and putting up his own money to finance this film and for doing excellent research and sticking to the vision to bring the last few hours of Christ closer to many millions of people and to introduce them to a living faith in Jesus Christ."	5.0	Accurate Biblical Portrayal of Christ's last few hours	2004-10-14	11	4	7

It is my opinion that if this film is not overtly anti-Semitic, it implies that attitude.  Also, I was troubled that in this film, there was not a lot of context regarding Jesus' life and teachings beyond the 12 hours of Passion-related events leading to His  death.Am I being too critical regarding the implied anti-Semitic elements and lack of context?  May I mention a couple of other things:  During Holy Week of 2004, there were two acts of vandalism perpetrated against a Jewish synagogue near where I live.  The synagogue had never experienced vandalism before.  It is the opinion of the clergy there, as well as that of Christian clergy at nearby parishes, that the Gibson movie may have influenced some young folks to commit the vandalism.In addition, there was an article in the L.A. Times about the ""Passion.""  The article mentioned a poll of young people who went to see the ""Passion.""  Many of these young people indicated that after seeing the film, they tended to have a more negative view of Jewish people.Of course, this does not mean that every young person who sees this film will go out and vandalize a synagogue.  Surely, Mr. Gibson would be quite upset about such acts being perpetrated against any religious institution.

I had questions about going but being on staff with a church, the leadership was encouraged to go to help with questions our congregants might have after seeing it. (None of which materialized other than comments of the gory screenplay.)  I must say that I was truly offended by the gore and graphic nature of the telling of the atonement. The film left me feeling disturbed and uneasy as I left the theatre. I hear Christians talk about not putting graphic images into our minds that are prevalent within movies of the modern era but then turn around a praise the visuals presented in The Passion.  Personally, I do not need the graphic, over the top visuals to understand the sacrifice that was made for mankind. There are good depictions of the life and sacrifice of Christ on film that are excellent that do not resort to this film's shock tactics. The DVD series ""Matthew"" is just one example.I will admit to one scene being done well in the film: The garden scene where Jesus confronts the serpent. The visual interpretation was excellent but not enough to save the film. I also like the original language score as well but recognize that for most, subtitles are difficult to deal with for a full length feature. Can I recommend this film? Absolutely not. Is it a good study of the atoning sacrifice on our behalf? No again. You want to know what was accomplished, read the Book.

There are no words that can describe the sadness in my heart when I realized that He took all that abuse, all that pain, so that I, so that we, might have a chance to join Him in Paradise one day.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	"There has never been a movie that has impacted me on such a personal, emotional, and spiritual level as this film, properly titled ""The Passion of the Christ"".  This movie, filmed with a degree of authenticity that has been praised by Christians world-wide, and clouded with as much contoversy, is by far the most brutal, most devastating, and indeed, the most powerful depiction of Jesus Christ's path to the cross.Filmed in Aramaic and Latin, the genuineness of this movie is almost unquestionable.  It focuses on the Scripture found in the new testament of the bible, specifically those chapters of the gospel that deal with the arrest, scourging and crucifixition of the Christ.  Opening in the garden of Gethsemane, the movie shows the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, and follows the brutal suffering of Jesus when he is arrested by the Jewish Pharasees and later handed over to Pontius Pilate and the Roman army where he is brutally scourged and beaten down in a sequence that is heart-wrenching as much as it is brutally, graphically violent.  Many sequences in this film are shown in flash-back, including the Last Supper, when Christ shares the first eucharist with his apostles, and teaches that he is the ""bread of life.""  The movie's climax centers around Jesus's crucifixition and death on the cross.Although many critics have admonished that this film is not for the faint of heart, I would like to suggest that this movie comes at a time when faith seems to waiver.  For my own part, I found that the film moved me on a very personal level, and left me weeping, not out of horror, but out of the immensely powerful message that Christ died for.  Ultimately, this is a film that serves not as entertainment, but as a healthy reminder that Christ died on the cross for our sins, that man might be spared.Although some critics have argued that the film is anti-Semetic, I would counter that the film is anything but.  Remember that Christ was a Jew, as were his apostles.  Further, Simon, who is pulled by Roman officers out of the crowd to help Christ carry his cross when his own battered body can no longer support it, he shows Christ mercy, standing against the Roman gaurds when they begin to beat him.  The depiction of mercy is present, even in the horror of Christ's crucifixition.Be warned that, though this film may arguably be the most honest and accurate depiction of Christ's passion ever, it may not be appropriate for younger audiences.  It is violent, and full of acts of human horrors that, though historically accurate, may be distrubing to younger viewers.That said, this film, in this reviewer's very humble opinion, should be seen by the masses.  It is profoundly moving and very inspiring.  I give my highest praises to Mel Gibson and the cast and crew of this film for taking a risk in making such a remarkable and powerful film.-Scott Kolecki"	5.0	The Passion Is Powerful	2004-03-08	3	0	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Amazon.com's ""star"" rating system makes rating Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" difficult.  Five stars, the top ranking, transaltes to ""I Love It!""  It's hard to believe that anyone can watch this movie and have an ""I Love It!"" reaction.  Having just viewed the movie for the first time, I can attest that Gibson and team have made an amazing, top-notch film, but it's also a movie that I don't want to see again for quite some time.""The Passion,"" appropriately titled, focuses primarily on Jesus' (played with phenomenal range and conviction by Jim Caviezel) last 12 hours of life -- from the betrayal of Judas to his death on the cross.  Completely abandoning the sugary-sweet pablum of so many ""traditional"" religious movies, ""The Passion"" shows its characters as real-world men and women living in a hard-scrabble real world . . . raggedy beards, threadbare clothes, poverty, and none of the benign halos of self-knowing holiness that plague other depictions of Christ.  We get some flashbacks to isolated scenes, such as the Last Supper, some of Jesus' lectures, and poignant shots of Jesus as a child and also working as a carpenter.  But these incidents are short interventions in an otherwise streamlined narrative.Jesus' betrayal by Judas is followed by aspects of Jesus' story that are largely unknown to Christians who attend church only at Christmas and Easter.  A ""trial"" by Jewish elders is followed by handing Jesus over to the Romans, who punt Jesus back to Herod for judgment (Pontius Pilate being savvy enough to avoid this hot potato).  But Jesus ends up back before Pilate and the elders demand the death of Jesus, whom they see as a dangerous rabble-rouser who is undermining centuries of holy teaching.The movie then turns to its most notorious aspects -- the torture and execution of Jesus.  While the gore is unrelenting, this is not mindlessly handled by Gibson and his team.  The extent of Jesus' suffering for mankind is the precise point of the story, and it is impossible to watch this movie and not be affected.  This is a movie that brings Jesus' sacrifice home in the most powerful of ways -- by showing in graphic fashion how much the man endured and still managed to ask for man's forgiveness, ""for they know not what they do.""This is a movie of powerful performances and visual artistry . . . for all its horrors, ""The Passion"" is a beautiful film.  The soundtrack is also understated, yet important - the few times I noticed it, I was moved.  And the special effects are perhaps too good - the violence unleashed on Jesus' body never looks cartoonish or unrealistic.I'll leave it to others to debate the charges of anti-semitism that arise from ""The Passion.""  As a relatively uninformed observer, the movie appears balanced to me -- most of the Jewish elders demand Jesus' death (although there are a couple of elders who question this, but they are shouted down), but there are plenty of other Jews in the movie who decry what they see -- the problem is that they are outside the local power structure.  All in all, it doesn't come across as an anti-semitic movie unless one starts with the proposition that the movie tells an anti-semitic story.Few movies qualify as ""important"" in my book, but this one is right up there with Spielberg's two WWII movies, ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List,"" as well as other flicks like ""The Accused,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Mississippi Burning,"" and ""Ghandi.""  These movies generally aren't easy to watch, but they tell stories that I should know better, and they tell the story so well that it is seared into my brain.  ""The Passion"" is an unforgettable masterpiece -- it may be a couple of years before I feel the need to watch it again, but I'm sure that I'll remember every scene.A must-see."	5.0	Astounding, Gut-Wrenching, Moving, Difficult Film	2005-05-16	5	4	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3IG0P99AV6TTK	scott sirk	This is an awesome movie!  In our visual age it brought the the Passion narrative of the four Gospels alive.  The last Seven words spoken by Jesus Christ from the Cross was incredibly moving.  The Way of the Cross was wonderfully filmed.  I loved the presentation of Saint Veronica in the Way of the Cross.  Simon the Cyrenean locking arms with Christ to carry the Cross.  I thought that scene was particularly moving in that Simon a Jew shared Christ's final journey by interlocking arms with Jesus.  The actress portraying Mary was awesome and the flashback scenes with Jesus and Mary were tremendous.

The truth is, we don't know the exact details of the man Jesus of Nazareth's execution- which by the way was one of many executions that took place during this time period.  But scientifically speaking, we definitely know that the majority of the violence portrayed in this film does more to sell tickets than to actually show possible torture (a person would have went into shock or died from blood loss after the first few blows).This movie does nothing more to perpetuate a myth to gull thoughtless people into believing in a superstitious religion.	1.0	Snuff film with the same accuracy as Cinderella & Star Wars	2004-09-03	28	10	18

(Saying over and over again that they wish Mel had made another Mad Max film only shows they did not have the ability or desire to consider what the film was about.  You probably should not have seen it since you are clearly unable to grasp the truth of His message.)That said, I will not lower myself again to the same level as other reviewers who attack differing personal spiritual views as a means to criticize the film - I can only suppose it is because they are threatened by the message.  If you didn't like the film, say why you didn't like the film. Don't call people who DID find the film a profoundly moving experience idiots because you can't understand our faith.  It is only demonstrating your own ignorance to do so.  If you choose not to believe that Jesus was who he was portrayed as in ""The Passion of the Christ"" and in the Bible, that is your opinion and you are welcome to it.  But save the intellectual drivel about how anyone who does believe is deluded and cannot think for themselves.  Learn to read and research and you might be surprised at what you learn.  And - By the way - I am a Christian (NOT Catholic) who was brought up Unitarian.  I know how to read and think for myself!  I'm not being blindly lead.  Free will is a basic point of Faith.  I use my free will to believe.  You use yours to ridicule.  I'm sad for you.In terms of visual message, this film was spectacular.  The cinematography is amazing.  It truly conveys the anguish most involved experienced - not just Jesus and his followers.  For those who claim that His message is missed in the film, I call your attention to the last moments on the Cross when the other men there had the chance to choose their path - the redemption one received while the other continued to ridicule.  That is the bottom line message - the redemption and forgiveness that is available to all.I have seen many reviews that criticize Mel for making it too violent.  I find this ironic.  Have you watched the violence out there on film, in video games, even on TV?  I certainly have plenty of it in my film library.  Our culture has become immune to it.  I expect that had the violence not been portrayed so graphically the film would have lost substantial impact.  That said, it was the most difficult film I have ever watched and I cried throughout the film in the theater, but I purchased the DVD.  I will watch it again when I feel I need to be reminded of the sacrifice that was made on the behalf of all who believe - and all who do not."	5.0	Sad how threatened some are by Jesus' story...	2005-02-06	16	10	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A14ZFXW5U4376U	sergio	This movie tells the story of Salvation in an impressively real manner, which should be very close to the way things were done at the time of the Roman occupation of Israel. The love of God for Humanity and the sacrifice of His only begotten Son for the Salvation of Mankind provides a glimpse of the Infinite Nature of God's Compasion towards His creatures. This excellent movie is a call to reality, because Christians are used to a sanitized version of the crucified Christ which must be very far from the reality of that time. Knowing what Christ and His Mother really went through, as well as the way in which other followers were affected by the Passion, sheds a lot of light on events we tend to take for granted or at least see in an merely abstract fashion.	5.0	It is as it was	2005-03-05	4	4	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ADZT4E2NCG7A3	Seth Crosson	The story is quite famous. And its message about sacrifice and love is most definitely memorable. James Caviezel (Jesus) does a good job. Though in retrospect, he didn't have much of a script to work with. Much of the movie is about the actual torturing and executing of Christ. So he basically screams and wails a lot as he is sliced, stabbed, whipped, and crucified. But there are some early dialogues that are good. He plays the emotion of the Christ (a disturbed mind knowing of his betrayal and imminent capture, the angry defiance in the high courts, the psychological pain of humiliation and public torture, the sorrow of feeling forsaken by peers and God himself, the forgiving and proud resurrection ect.). He doesn't play the script of Christ, he plays the affect of Christ; and does it quite well. Maria Morgenstern is a convincing Virgin Mary. And I think as far as acting goes, her and Monica Belllucci (Magdalene) steal the show by virtue of lengthier scripts reveling the innards of their talents. I was quite impressed with character of the Virgin. Morgenstern very convincingly portrayed Mary's story. A movie about Mary has yet to be made; but if it is done, I think it has serious potential at the box office. At the end of the film a lot of people were crying; and I think that the reason for this, other than spirituality or all that suffering shown in the movie, is that Morgenstein painted a picture of Mary that is a little different and very effective. In essence it starts off as an insane worrying of the news of her son's arrest; then the affect progresses to the intensence tearful sorrow and shock when her and Magdelene are watching the various brutal beatings and execution, getting sprayed by his blood, flinching on every fall of the hammer, to the silent and very angry confrontation with the Head Jewish Priest/Rabbi after the Crucifixion. The actors on the Roman side (Pilate) were also convincing. The partier king Herrod was an amusing twist (most likely the only funny part in the movie). If you are a Christian, the movie may draw tears. If you are a Jew, you might get pissed off. Or you might feel sad that someone had to suffer so much for what we sometimes take for granted in America, freedom of speech. If neither, you may like the movie for its costumes, scenery, and special effects (gore). The scenes showing the mind-bending sorrow and horror of Mary were quite sad. The costumes were great. And the special effects were bordering Oscar worthiness. I have never watched a more convincing and lengthy torture scene. It looked very real! The act of crucifixion looked real too. There are a lot ways of looking at a figure like Christ; and this is one such way. Though if you really want to know him, I suggest picking up a bible or speaking to a Christian. There are of course some shortfalls to the movie. Basically, the Character of Jesus is only defined in the most rudimentary sense. And the movie makes Jews look like utter monsters. Despite the visual accomplishments of the special effects crew, I highly doubt that any man could have withstood that kind of torture and still made it to the cross. My medical knowledge is telling me that there would be no way...it would have ended with blood loss and hypovolemic shock. So there could be an issue of accuracy as well. I don't think the Jews were that brutal. And Gibson is treading somewhat dangerous ground with his reputation. But it is a predictable thing; directors often opt for a more sellable and sensational story than a less sensational accurate recreation (there are many examples of this). So at times you see the sappy chess game tactics Hollywood uses to suck money out of people. And at times it kind is does make itself a little obvious. This excessive beating is likely just be a ploy by Gibson to sucker Christians into crying and shelling out cash for the tickets, books, pay per views, Premium services, and DVD's. And that is somewhat repugnant. But hey, it wouldn't be the first time Hollywood did that. So, I can cut Gibson a little slack by virtue of the nature of his business and his being new to directing. Though from the response of the public, I guess some others felt otherwise.	4.0	A good spirit and gore flick	2005-07-24	4	3	1

It was low budget made epic by the incredible cinematography and even a score that grows on you.But it's only the movie. That's it. There are no special features. There is no director's commentary - that EVERYONE was looking forward to. There's nothing. Gibson didn't spend any time at all with the DVD. It would have taken two hours of his time. I can play the much lesser film, Contact, and get three commentaries. And so for many modern films, good or middling.So I certainly won't say - boo, hiss. I just wanted to say that I had looked forward to something that simply wasn't included on the DVD.	5.0	Accurate depiction - but disappointing DVD	2004-09-25	5	4	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A32Z0G8WC39V0O	Sexy Bachelor	"Timeless, memorable epic on the final moments of the historical Jesus of Nazareth who was called the Christ (""the anointed one""). Opening scene starts off with Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane at the Mount of Olives, and ends with him walking out of his tomb. No spoilers here about everything else in between.If you're a visual person, watch this movie and appreciate its artistic message, as gruesome as it is portrayed. Flashback technique is used very well. For me, watching this DVD once is enough. I can't stand the sight of all the blood and gore, but know that to be true to reality as the Director would have it to be. Jesus wasn't whipped with just a few strokes as revisionists would like to imagine it to be. If you yet don't understand how Jesus suffered and died, this is THE film to watch. If you want to live in a fantasy world where Jesus' death was a painless one (no one talks about it these days!), whitewashed through quick verablizations at Sunday school at some vague notion of ""death"", then this film will shock and terrify you into numbness. This is not recommended for feeble minded kids.If you know little or nothing about Jesus except hearsay, start by reading the Bible first, specifically all the 4 Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament. Next, read ""The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ"" by visionary Anne Catherine Emmmerich. Director Mel Gibson used this book as a reference to his movie. Once you're done reading the entire, watch this Mel Gibson movie. Things could be clearer to you then. Stop succumbing to sloth and go read the above first.Jesus' miracles, life, suffering and death would only make sense if viewed in a strictly religious and/or deep Christian spiritual sense. Without understanding these first, I don't know how else you can see Him. How you will react or perceive this movie depends on how much you know about Jesus, or how much you believe or know Jesus, to begin with. This Passion movie doesn't dilute the truth of Jesus and tells it like it is. If not for his false accusers, Jesus may not have died the way that he did. These false accusers happen to be his fellow Jews and other power-hungry politicians of his day. Strangely, most people would prefer to believe in lies elsewhere and cannot appreciate the social, religious, or spiritual tones to Jesus' Person, and his life and death. No one likes to talk about death and the cross these days, but Mel Gibson shows it like it is. Kudos to Director Mel Gibson and this graphic film about the final moments of Jesus' life on earth!If you're Christian, whatever your denomination, perhaps this film could make you appreciate what it means when the Church and Bible say that ""Jesus died for our sins"". Of course, this has to read in the context of the cosmology/theology of salvation history.If I had walked with Jesus before he entered Jerusalem and knew of the spiritual significance of his mission, I might tell him not to sacrifice his precious life for this putrid human race! Remember that until today, 5/6 of the world still refuses to understand Jesus.

I was totally blown away by the depth of love and kindness that Jesus has shown us by going to the cross.  You can read other reviews to hear about synopsis and cinematography, for me this movie accurately portrayed the depth of Gods love for us all.Mel Gibson does a great job in relaying the point that Jesus went willingly to the cross for us all; he did it for love, to reconcile lost humanity with God.Anti-Semitic claims are unfounded in a number of ways. First Jesus was born as a Jew, coming to save Jews. Secondly, they (Jews nor Romans) had no power to put Jesus on the cross; he willingly laid his life down for us all. And thirdly, we all put Jesus there. He died for the sins of the world. The same course of events would have happened if he had come to any other people group. As for ""the blood being on the Jews heads and that of their children."" I say that is a blessing not a curse. It was by Jesus shed blood that humanity was reconciled to God. God is such a wonderful, loving redeemer that he can turn blood, a sign of death, into a sign of life.The graphicness of this film was tactful because it was realistic. I am glad that it was not watered down because this world is a violent place and Jesus faced the violence of the sinful nature of us all. I couldn't help but to cry with the pain and sorrow and rejoice with the resurrection. Worship was my continuous reaction throughout this film, in pain and resurrection, how else can one react to such love.I recommend this movie more than any other I have ever seen.

"We (Campus Crusade for Christ) just watched this movie today (Good Friday) to put into perspective Jesus's sacrifice for all of mankind.We can go ahead and live our Christian lives and hardly imagine all that Jesus went through, even if the passion and the resurrection are the cornerstones of our faith. This film graphically portrays all the pain Jesus had to undergo, enabling us to better understand what was meant by the words ""This is my blood which will be given up for you."" It enables us to look at how the sufferings of one man leads to eternal life for all of mankind.The whole story is historically accurate; the gospels give you the same story. Most of all, the emotions that are elicited by the picture are indescribable; you can almost tell which people in the crowd that gathered to see it have never seen it before because the reactions were just incredibly sorrowful. The final scene turns all of that around, enabling us to re-focus on the resurrection and new hope.Overall, Christian watchers will be taken away from the very beginning. But those who are not very familiar with the Christian faith are in for another experience, as a lot of doctrines come into play and it can get a little difficult to digest.

You just can't imagine how painful, bloody, or brutal the crucifixioun really was until you ""see"" it in front of you.I would not take children to see this movie. I feel it is too graphic for young ones. After all, many adults I've talked with couldn't handle the scale of physical brutality that was shown.I would recommend this movie for adult church groups who are discussing the crucifixion and what Jesus had to go through in order for Christians to have Eternal Life. It is an excellent source for discussion.Lastly, I would also like to point out a particular review that caught my eye. For the benefit of the ""gentleman"" who wrote the review, I'd like to ask him why in the world he watched this movie if he didn't like the subject matter. The quality of production, acting, and cinematography should be considered as well in a review."	5.0	Gripping!	2004-12-20	9	4	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3TBEPIDD2BUX8	S. Harris	I'm not squeamish, and I love gory horror flicks. But, those type of films have a different target audience than the Passion does. As others have pointed out, it's virtually a snuff film. The violence done to Jesus was not the sacrifice he made to redeem humanity; many, many people have undergone such savage treatment. What elevates his pain and suffering over anyone elses?I hope the irony of the masses of Christians subjecting their children to this film while at the same time deploring violence in videogames isn't lost on the public.	2.0	The violence is over the top	2006-06-19	22	9	13
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	"To remind the faithful that Jesus suffered for our sins is laudable. But why go so far to prove this point?As I cringed while watching the relentless persecution on the screen, I wondered what Christ's real message was. Any account of His ""passion"" should move us to tears and/or drive us to count our mercies.I find it intriguing that Gibson chose instead to pound us into numbness with the excruciating depiction of His last moments. If Jesus actually received the amount of punishment dished out in this film, He would have been dead three times over before arriving at Calvary.Don't get me wrong. I hold the production values of this film in very high regard, and I think it was a very clever decision to have the dialogue in original languages (subtitles were great though, thank you). The movie is excellently made, except perhaps for the predictable choirs that serve as the background score.But from a purely dramatic point of view, I felt that the gore-fest is self-defeating. I found myself recoiling from the movie and instead of being moved by Christ's suffering, or awed by his sacrifice, I felt abused by a filmmaker intent on punishing an audience.Others may well find a strong spirituality in The Passion but it was Gibson's fury, not his faith, that left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth."	3.0	ACCURACY IS ONE THING, SHRILL OVERKILL QUITE ANOTHER	2004-06-01	34	14	20

Warswick ""High School History Teacher"""	"Even after more than 6 months since I last saw the film at the theater, this film is still something that I can not get over.  If you purchase only one DVD this year, make this the one!Now that all the controversy has died down you can watch this film and truly enjoy Mel Gibsons film making abilities.  His ""in your face"" style may have turned off some people, but I found it refreshing.  How could you not focus on the suffering of Christ?  How could you not show the violence he suffered through during his last 24 hours on this earth?  The violence is there to show his compassion for us, his utter love and ultimate sacrifce for us, even those who do not believe.  The violence was there for a reason.  I find it ironic that those who condemned the violence the most are those who consider films like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction to be works of genius.The acting is top notch.  James Caviezel must be nominated for Best Actor, as he turns in a performance second to none (and in a dead language at that!).  His portrayal of Jesus Christ was by far the best I've ever seen.  If he isn't nominated I will forever be sure he was robbed.But the great acting doesn't stop here.  Maia Morgensterns portrayel of Mary was superb and often brought me to tears.  She shows the love Mary had for her son and the connection between the two actors is amazing.  She often portrays emotion with her eyes, something I find many actors can not do, even the ""best"".However, my favorite performance after James' was Histo Shopov as Pontius Pilate.  Wow.  This guy is amazing!  Where did Mel find him?  I don't know, but he should be in MANY more roles and I hope both he and Maia start appearing in films here in the US much more often.  His portrayal of Pilate was chilling and brought some humanity to this figure, which is difficult to do.Cinematography?  Beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.

The bad of course sadden me because obviously the reviewer doesn't totaly understand the depth of what the movie was created for. I saw the movie today and was absolutely amazed. I have never seen anything so heart-wretching in my life. I had tears rolling down my face during the whole movie. I know its just a movie, but it gives us just a small glimpse of what He really went through for us. Yes we all have heard the stories, but we could never really picture what he did for us until now. I have so much respect for Mel Gibson. Because he made something so amazing, something that has stirred up so much tension. He has stood against all the critics, and the negativity. He's an awesome man. He stood up for what he believed in, he made something that people said wouldn't happen.  And I did not find it anti-semitic.  I believe that Gods love for us took him there. And that our sins sent him there. We all sent Jesus to the cross, no race, no denomination or whatever else you could think of. We ALL did. Christ dying on the cross was something done for us, and by us. This movie by far is the best movie I have ever seen. It was so Biblically accurate too.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1F7CMDX6QDJVA	"shoutgrace ""savedbyhisgrace"""	In my opinion one must ignore all controversial reviews and see it for yourself. It's been going on for centuries surrounding how Christ died and who killed him. This film does not reflect that at all and doesn't put any one group in jeopardy. It was our sins that nailed Jesus to the cross. His love kept him there. Remember when Jesus said he had the power to lay down his life and take it up again. This command came from His Father in Heaven. This is also written in the Scriptures of the four Gospels.&#60;P&#62;The film itself is beautifully portrayed and well-acted. The artistry is superb in authentic art and culture of biblical times. Jim Caveziel who plays the part of Jesus Christ so well that you think it's Jesus himself who took over the part. He looks like him and acts like him! His role is sincere and powerful. Maia Morgansten who plays his mother, Mary is beautiful in her role as she follows her son Jesus from the trial, scourging and the cross. The graphic violence maybe too intense for small children. So adults should review before letting young children view it. One may question why Gibson's film was so violent? He did a good job in sticking with the Scriptures according to the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 52 & 53. The crucifixion an ancient form of execution invented by the Romans was not a pleasant sight. According to history when crucifixion was in use unfortunate candidates were tortured or flogged before being hung and some didn't survive the horrible beatings.&#60;P&#62;The Passion is a film of painful beauty and sacrifical love of mankind. It is spoken in Aramaic (ancient Hebrew) and Latin with English subtitles. But one can understand the language by heart just by watching the suffering of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It's one of the best Christian film on the subject of how Christ really suffered and died for all of us. It has a nice end that doesn't leave the viewer thinking that Christ just died and shows He victoriously rose from the grave on the third day. It makes an excellent witnessing tool, plus a keeper in your film collection. I highly recommend!	5.0	It Will Touch Your Soul Forever	2004-09-30	14	11	3

The Passion is a brutal, historical account of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus as recorded in the Holy Scriptures.  Mr. Gibson rips to shreds every idyllic Sunday school image of the trial and Crucifixion of Christ by portraying the Roman art of torture and cruel execution on the cross in the finest and minutest detail.  But please do not let the gore distract you from the mission - which is Jesus' driving passion to embrace the fate of the Cross for the sake of saving humanity. Jim Caviezel gives an incredible performance as Jesus - his humility, kindness, passion and endurance resonated in every scene.  The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful and made the frightening torture scenes even harder to bear.  The aching soundtrack framed every scene perfectly, from Jesus' struggle in the Garden of Gethsemane (being taunted by the Evil one) to his mind-blowing bravery whilst being brutally scourged by the Roman soldiers. The show is a work of art whatever your religious beliefs, but it must be noted that Christians would probably benefit more from the show by having some background to the life and works of Jesus prior to the last traumatic hours of his life. For those unfamiliar with the details, the disturbing question must surely have been ""Why? Why did this have to happen to this man? Why did he have to die LIKE THIS"". That personal journey to seek the answer would probably fulfil the Passion of Mr. Gibson more than any box-office record or accolades ever would."	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-05-08	10	5	5

As a Christian who grew up knowing the gospel account of the crucifixion, I have always known that in the Garden of Gethsemene (the first scene in the movie) Jesus made the choice to do the will of the Father--made the choice to go to the cross.  But I have never thought about what I so clearly saw in ""The Passion""--that any time during his suffering, Jesus could have chosen to put a stop to what was going on.  His mother's words, spoken after she had watched her son suffering for a very long time, revealed that to me in a way that I had never realized: ""My son, when are you going to put a stop to all of this?""  I do not hold the Jews responsible for the death of Jesus.  Any group of people could have stood in their place.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AY4C1GJMJILC7	S. J. John	This film portrays the very graphic and disturbing final 12 hours of the life of Jesus as authenticaly as possible primarily following the gospels of Mathew, Mark, luke and John.  Minimal subtitles fill in what might not be infered through the visual story telling.  The dialog is in Aramic and latin. There are a few flashbacks that give a sense of personal investment for the viewer of the the man being horribly ravaged by the Roman's who heartlessly beat and physicaly torture the man repeatedly for the bulk of the film.  Given this last 12 hours concept little is revealed of the miraculous or divine nature of the Christ as the title assures him to be.  We do see a passionate and strong spritual being in the garden being tempted by satan and are re-assured again of Jesus as divine at one other time.  Other than that his divine nature could possibly be missed and we are given Jesus as man which was how he was to endure humanity's wrath.  The image's are brutal and relentless.  The satanic images are searing and frightening and the film does reference material from outside the gospel which keep the satanic imagery included throughout the film from what I have read.  The point of this film seems to have been to leave an indelable mark on the collective conciousness of this generation and its should definately succeed.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2Y70AOI3NG37J	"S. Koropeckyj ""Romi Panchir"""	As so many other people on this review page have done by writing their Christian histories, I will do the same. I was born an Ukrainian Catholic (for those who don't know there are 13 branches of Catholisicsm), as a child I seldom went to church until my First Communion when I started going more often. Since then I drifted away from faith and the church once more.I always asked myself whether I believe in God and if so why. For if I do believe in God but because I fear him then that it is not faith but I must love God and aspire to be as close to God in order to acheive true faith.Now the movie kicks in. And if it were not for some major qualms I had with this movie and its underlying philosophy I would rate it much higher.The first main problem I have with this film is that it teaches us nothing about the method to get into Heaven. As Christians we must aspire to the perfection of Jesus Christ. We must try to live our lives without sin and try our best to fend off the cruel impish demons of temptation. We must reject the devil at every door. The beginning of this movie shows us some of this principle, it ends soon afterwards. Then we start seeing Jesus getting beaten and tormented. How am I to come closer to God by watching a snuff film? Am I to emulate Jesus' death and try to get executed or am I to become a sado-masochist? Perhaps the Passion was the most important part of Jesus' life. I don't know. What I do know is that Jesus taught some of the most interesting and radical things the world ever heard and unlike everyone else he practiced them.The words of Jesus could inspire people of every nationality and of every religion however the death of Jesus however cannot have the same effect. We all knew how Jesus died and though we could not picture it so vividly knew why he died. I wonder if Mel Gibson understood why Jesus died. However what does the death of Jesus mean if we cannot open those Pearly Gates? Perhaps all of those people who saw The Passion will go to church each day now. Will that get them into those Pearly Gates, I THINK NOT. Being a Christian is a much deeper feeling. Suppose we did not know how Jesus died, would we still be good Christians?These are my values and my opinions are they God's opinion's? Maybe not, but don't be too sure that your opinions are one with God's either.The movie was visually stunning, everything from the death to the demons looked fantastic and realistic. But ask yourself why you believe in God and why you want to go to Heaven before you disagree. Do you sympathize with an actor that played Jesus or do you truly love God and want to be eternally united with him.The movie was not anti-semetic. Somebody had to kill Jesus. If they didn't let the Romans do it then somebody else would have to have. That was God's will.Don't judge lest you be judged yourself (yeah that is a paraphrase but does it matter) Don't vote against this before you ponder this. I may be right about something.Thanks a lot~God Bless you all.	2.0	Path to heaven...	2004-09-02	25	8	17

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	"There sure was a lot of controversy surrounding The Passion of the Christ when it was released back in 2004.After finally viewing the movie this past weekend, I can certainly see why the movie is deeply upsetting...especially to all that believe that Jesus was The Messiah. The Passion portrays Christ's death as one of the most brutal I have ever seen in any movie, and I've watched a lot of modern day TV & film with some ugly death scenes...including HBO's Rome that suggests it was a pretty barbaric time in the hundred or so years Before and After Christ.Perhaps the interpretation that Christ's death was so horrifying was ""controversial"" to some because they'd have preferred a depiction of a ""kinder, gentler"" murder of Jesus. I'd therefore have to go with ""deeply upsetting"" versus ""controversial"" when asked about the violence in this movie.The other word-of-mouth controversy that I heard about regarding this movie was that the Jewish community was angry because The Passion depicted Jews as cruel and savage. On the contrary...Jews were depicted no more uncivilized than others living in the period. If fact, according to The Passion it apparently wasn't even the Jews that directly murdered Jesus; Jewish priests did have him arrested. But ultimately--according to the canonical Christian Gospel that the The Passion clearly based a lot of its story from--it was Pontius Pilate (the governor of Roman Judea) that presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion. Hence, it was the Romans that carried out a death sentence and did most of the actual torturing and crucifying.Therefore, as for controversial....I say, what's all the hub-bub, Bub?As for the movie...it was extremely powerful. Informational...educational even. The film's dialogue is in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew, with subtitles. And do indeed watch it with the subtitles; watching in the native languages adds a whole degree of reality to a movie that already comes off as very believable.The acting is first class. James Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus is burned onto my memory. There are many aspects to this movie that I will not soon forget. Because of The Passion I have a whole new respect for the Communion ritual practiced in many Christian religions.To me this movie far outweighs controversy with its excellent adaptation of how an event in a very tumultuous period in History could have gone down.The Passion of the Christ is a collector's item.

The truth hurts and people don't want to except the fact that this really took place.I thought the whole movie was excellent maybe one of the best movie I have ever seen.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2JA6512KM7ZH6	"""slinky-m"""	"This film is a beautiful piece of work; however, I have reservations with Mel Gibson's job as an artist and storyteller. Mainly, my problem is this: when you step into the world of this movie, it doesn't matter if you've studied the Bible all your life or not because this incarnation of the story has a life and style of its own. Having said this, when watching The Passion, I felt disappointed in the complete lack of salesmanship of Jesus as a character. I know what you're thinking (""How can you not know the backstory of Jesus Christ?"") but stop and consider ... why do we feel so incredibly sorry for Jesus while he is being crucified, and not nearly as bad for the thieves on crosses next to him? They have no back story, they are one-dimensional characters and we only see them in one light: they are being tortured. In the same sense, this ENTIRE FILM deals only with Jesus the martyr and barely even alludes to Jesus the teacher. I felt compassion and sorrow for the man being tortured on screen, but the ridiculous degree to which the torture was shown (including Hollywood-ized cutting in and out, showing different angles in a deliberate attempt to evoke our emotions and guilt) was absurd and unnecessary. There are times when the level of gore actually validate comments from a recent episode of South Park: ""That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!""The film begins with Jesus in a seizure-like trance and shows him struggling through the last hours of his life; is it not equally if not more important what he taught us BEFORE he died for us? I think this film does a great disservice in omitting nearly any kind of back story to develop Christ as a character to which we can relate; that disservice is done to both Christians and non-Christians alike, in that it mis-allocates the emphasis and relevance of the Biblical story of Christ. There is a very good reason why the authors of the Bible chose to tell the story of Jesus' life before his crucifixion, a reason I think this film demonstrates is lost on Gibson despite his obvious passion (for lack of a better word) and faith.I believe in a thing called the ""Emotional Quota."" What I mean by this is that there is a certain amount of emotional reaction that occurs in the film-viewing experience. Either you see characters react in the film, or you react in your mind by filling in details. This explains why horror movies are considered so bad: the characters react FOR you, and so you don't have to do anything but sit back and be spooked or awed by the occasional visual effect. In Schindler's List, however, you see stark depictions of horrific acts, and most of the time characters simply do not react to the violence seen (a Nazi shoots a Jewish woman in the head and then calmly walks away with no visible remorse).  Since we see no reaction, our minds fill in the rest and we feel anger, grief, sadness, etc.In this way I think Gibson traded his role as a professional storyteller for that of a devout Catholic in the making of The Passion. He chooses to show us images that spell out precisely how we should feel about the story rather than allowing us the privilege to react freely. As an example, when Jesus' hands are being nailed to the cross, they show it in two different ways: the former shows a hand with a nail being driven through it, in slow-motion and from different angles (using cinematography to pull from us the emotions of sorrow and grief), and the latter shows only the silhouette of the wooden cross, which is accompanied by a dull thudding noise and the appearance of a nail through the bottom of the wood. We never actually SEE the nail entering his hand but we see dark fluid dripping from the nail, causing our minds to fill in the graphic details more clearly and vividly than if we were simply shown it in itself. The same principle is exhibited in the shower scene with the Colombians in DePalma's Scarface.I admire and respect the courage and tenacity it took Gibson to bring his vision come to life, but this movie would have been far better and more effective both narratively and evangelically had he put more forethought into how best to tell the story and evoke the emotions he obviously was trying to reach. Mel Gibson should follow Brian DePalma and Steven Spielberg's lead: understatement makes a more powerful impact than overstatement."	3.0	A good effort, but....	2004-04-07	22	9	13

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2K0Y55A5KQSU7	Sloopydrew	The Passion of the Christ is fairly faithful to the bible it was based on.  Because it's only based on one section of the New Testament, it does feel like watching a film adaptation of the end of a book.  I am well-versed in the Bible, so this wasn't a problem for me, but I feel it was a bit exclusionary to not include some backstory (even though the title clearly reveals that it's a cinematic passion play).Mel Gibson's directing and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography bring the film to vivid life.  This is the second time in a year that I've praised Deschanel's camera work in a film.  The man is becoming a force to be reckoned with.The film is far from perfect, but it's worth a viewing.  The DVD itself has a clean and pristine picture that really brings out the blues used during the nighttime scenes.  The DTS soundtrack isn't quite as active as I would have liked, but you'll still flinch with every crack of the whip.  There are almost no extras, which makes me think a deluxe collector's edition won't be far off.	3.0	Not perfect, but worth a viewing...	2004-08-27	12	9	3

This movie portrays the events as they happened & it was probably actually worse than this extremely brutal portrayal.  It will shock you, but it will let you see firsthand what the Lord went through to redeem us.  Fairy tale?!?  Who would make up a fairy tale like this?  James Caviezel is great as Christ!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1R2ONSLAI3M2X	"S.M. ""horror buff"""	After hearing so much contraversy about this film, I was anxious to view it for myself to see what all the contraversy was about. I saw The Passion Of The Christ at the movies ( sold out of course ) and left the theater very moved by this film. Mel Gibson really delivers in this film. My hat's off to him for having the courage to make such a film. I own the movie Jesus (2000) staring Jeremy Sisto and think this is a fabulous movie and Jeremy Sisto was the perfect choice to portray Jesus. He gave an outstanding performance! I also own Jesus of Nazereth which is a excellent film staring Robert Powell portraying Jesus. However, Passion starts with the final 12 hours of Jesus' life. The movie starts with him praying in the garden and being tempted by Satan ( who in this film was actually portrayed by a woman ). We see Jesus stomp on the serpent that Satan has let loose..showing Satan that he will not be tempted and will continue to carry on the whole reason he was put on this earth. James Caviezel who portrays Jesus in this film delivers an outstanding performance. Even though the movie is not spoken out in the English language and you have to actually read everything that is said on the screen, it does not take away anything from this movie. Gibson wanted Jesus to speak in his native tongue of Arabic making this film more special to me. I must say that it is hard to watch all the beatings and torture that Jesus had to endure before his crucifixion. This movie really touches you.... especially the scenes between Jesus and his mother Mary. We can see the love Jesus has for his mother in the scenes when he is carrying the cross to the crucifixion site. Every time he sees his mother, it seems to give him more strength to carry on and carry on his purpose. The crucifixion itself is hard to watch for it makes you really realize the suffering Jesus went through for our sins to be forgiven. Some people might not want to watch this movie because of the violence and blood but we must realize that this actually happened and in my opinion, we should all see what our Savior did for us. This is a well written, well acted account of Jesus' final hours on earth and worth owning in my opinion. No one will ever forget Mel Gibson for giving us this film and for opening our eyes to the real Passion of Christ.	4.0	Mel Gibson Delivers......	2006-02-25	12	8	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AMGGZCWY3VNZC	S. Morales	"Despite all the ""controversy"" (for what, I don't know) Passion finally hit theaters on Ash Wednesday to blockbuster box office numbers. I have a feeling though that after the initial punch of this movie wears off, more and more people will look back at it with an ""eh, it was good, not great"" attitude. The entire film is presented in Latin so subtitles are used, but they're easy to follow, so it's not a hindrence.The movie mainly is on a last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life, therefore, there is no big Last Supper scene amoung other interesting scriptures as taken from the Bible. Sure there are a few ""flashback"" scenes and the Last Supper comes up as one of them, but for those people expecting any sort of character development, especially those who are non-christian/catholic and haven't grown up with stories of Jesus, won't feel the impact as much as christians will. That could or could not be seen as a flaw depending on who the audience is.Definitely the most interesting and memorable aspects of the film are when Christ is being punished through severe scourging by the hands of soldiers (2nd half of the film); these scenes are incredibly graphic and should NOT by any means be exposed to children. Seeing Christ being whipped by knife thonged whips and bleeding profusely isn't something that's easily forgettable and will stick in the minds of viewers for a LONG time to come. That of course doesn't include the nailing to the cross scenes. These images are so strong in fact that I myself felt like getting up and yelling ""stop"" while watching it. It's not the cool hollywood entertainment type violence here. This is meant to show a truth, a graphic truth, and one cannot help but be repulsed or saddened by it. Now in terms of the movie being offensive towards Jewish people, I think that opinion is ridiculous. There really was nothing in this film to offend anyone, it was basically the Scripture in the Bible of the last 12 hrs of Jesus put to film. There were no opinionated remarks of any kind.Now even though overall this was a good movie, it was indeed flawed for a few reasons. First, I didn't like The Virgin Mary's part (i forget the actresses name). I felt the character too 1 dimensional, all she really did was cry during the whole film and put on these very dramatic looks on her face. I didn't feel like she was really his Mother, she felt more like Jesus' sister. Secondly, the first half dragged in certain parts, most especially the scene after Jesus is captured by the soldiers and brought into a dark temple by rulers of the city (i forget the names of them as well.) They stood around asking Jesus questions dumbfounded as to why he proclaims himself King of the Jews, and it goes on for a quite a while. Third, a lot of the movie felt too overdramatic; the wind through people's hair while tears fall from their eyes in slow motion, etc. There was an excessive amount in this film that kind of took away from the reality of it. And lastly, the ending which portrayed Jesus resurrecting from the dead. The 1 scene ending was too short and too fast, I felt it should have been enlongated, showing more of Mary and others.Overall, this indeed was a good movie, it just dragged a little during the first half and a couple of characters could've been written out better or more involved. The christian community will love it, while others will just say it's OK. I doubt the Academy will recognize it for next years Oscar awards though."	3.0	(3.5 stars) Good Flawed Film	2004-03-01	6	3	3

This movie was so intense and powerful it's beyond words.  I actually felt nauseous during parts of the movie and had to look away.  It was very brutal.  I told my husband when leaving the theater that I'm glad I saw the movie, but I don't ever want to see it again.  These images are forever engrained into my brain.  I would compare that feeling to the time I saw Schindler's List. It was important to see it, but I don't ever want to see it again either.  I would urge people - especially those w/children - to imagine what it must've been like for Mary, who had to watch her son be tortured this way.  Extremely powerful for me was the flashback she had when Jesus was a boy and she ran to comfort him after he had fallen depicted with him falling as he carries his cross.  This movie made me more aware of the fact that Jesus WAS human and felt pain.  How moving that he would pray for his persecutors as they were beating and killing him.  That kind of love is incomprehensible.  As someone else stated: See the movie, then read The Book.	5.0	Almost Speechless	2004-02-26	8	5	3

Makes you realize the scourging wasn't just a couple of hits with a club. He had so little skin left on him by the end it was awful! And the real shocker is that they didn't show all the wounds either...not by a long shot.

""The Passion of the Christ"" is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not, but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view, the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired, the cinematography is brilliant, and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism, moments of heartrending beauty, and of course, disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence.

I hesitated in doing so, because simply this movie is just that... a movie.  I'm a white woman, yet I can relate to people of most races (I've been called an ""honorary woman of color"" by several black and mixed friends).  Despite all this, I am troubled by a white man (Mr. James Caviezel) portraying the greatest Man to walk the earth:  Jesus Crhist.  The backstory is well-known by now, Gibson was forced (by the distributor) into casting a white man to play Jesus.  He should've stood his ground, but I can't blame him for caving in.  I've been involved in show business for most of my life, and I realize that in smalltown U.S.A., a white Jesus plays better in the multiplexes.But the movie is worthy, though exceedingly (and unrealistically) violent.  I understand that Mr. Gibson was filled with passion while creating this masterwork, but even he should've exercised some restraint.  Also, the foreign-language soundtrack was a bit much.

I just wish that it had been more Biblically accurate.  There is a whole lot of conjecture, and I'm also tired of seeing Mary Magdalene portrayed as a whore.  There is no Biblical evidence of her being a whore.  Also, I know he's catholic, but enough already.  There is so much catholic ledgend in this movie, that this Christian was really bugged by it.  To his merit, I enjoyed the flashback sequences that he provides; probably during Jesus' last hours, he did reflect back on his ministry.  It's incredibly graphic, so either wait for the cut version to come out (some of the violent scenes are reduced), fast forward through it (like I did), or leave the room during those parts.  Although cinema pales in the face of reality, sometimes too much violence numbs or repulses us (I think the latter is some of what Gibson wanted).  Another good Jesus movie would be the Gospel of John.

He is supposedly imbued with superhuman powers, given to him by his deity father. However, when faced with persecution by the Romans the guy just sits back and takes it!It is hard to find any verisimilitude in a ""god-like"" figure who can't do a thing to protect himself from a bunch of soldiers armed only with swords and whips.A friend of mind who is really into Christianity explained to me that Jesus let them torture and kill him so that all his followers would be absolved of their sins and ""saved"" - whatever that means. What a joke!! If the guy had all these fantastic powers it would only make sense that he stop the evil guys (Romans) and then absolve all of his followers sins after the fact.I don't think this movie even tries to look at any of the incongruities of the source material. My theory is this Jesus guy was a total fraud. He claims to be the son of God so he can meet girls and start a big movement (based on himself) by telling everyone he's the son of God. He claims that he's done all these ""miracles"" but when it's time to pull a miracle out his sleeve and save his own skin, he conveniently just sits back and says he is doing it for the good of everyone else. Give me a break!If this guy was such a saviour to the earth he would have done a heck of a lot more to clean up the mess that was going on in that part of the world at the time and quit trying to self-promote himself as some sort of messianic figure.

Most of the films about Jesus' life previous to this didn't really show the extent to which he suffered.  By the time he is hung on the cross, he doesn't even look bloodied or beaten, just serene and tired.  Most depicitons of Jesus on the cross (paintings, etc) don't show much in the way of what he endured.  It seems sanitized.  I think this tends to make us think that it wasn't so bad for him.  After all, he knew he was going to rise again, right?  So where's the stress?Well, this movie shows that it WAS tortuous.  It WAS an ordeal.  He did suffer, and suffer greatly.  It's the whole blinkin' point of the movie.  I won't know until I get to heaven (God willing) whether the film is historically accurate, or whether the violence was depicted ""over the top"".  I wasn't present on Good Friday, and neither were any of the detractors reviewing here.  But I think the film accomplishes it's point.  It reminds christians of Christ's suffering so we don't go about thinking it couldn't have been that bad (based on the sanitized images we have everywhere).I think bashing the movie for not having a story line is ridiculous.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A33CBNGDCD2CZ0	S. Saleh	The Passion of the Christ has caused rousing controversy all over America. People have called it anti-semitic and a gore-fest. I believe this movie is more complicated than that.The controversy over the alleged anti-semitism has been discussed over and over, so I won't go into it again.This movie is extremely bloody, and is definitely not for the queasy. However, I think I found some reasoning to it. Many people have said that the violence is overexaggerated, and I agree with them, though not for the same reasons. When watching the scenes of Jesus being tortured, you tend to cringe or empathize with Jesus. You can almost *feel* the pain when watching the scenes of violence, and I believe that was the idea. Maybe Jesus was tortured that much, maybe not, but the point is to get the audience to feel emotion, possibly imagine what it must have been like to go through that pain.One interesting point of the movie is the relationship between Jesus and his mother. The flashbacks between the two of them are some of the most emotional of the movie.My main problem with this movie is the theme of hopelessness. There is virtually none of Christ's teachings at all, and almost no references to Christ's resurrection. This is not the first interpretation to do so (Jesus Christ Superstar ends in a similar way) but it should have some message of hope after all that pain. Still, it was a good movie to see, and it will certainly leave you thinking.	4.0	Just hear me out	2004-08-21	11	8	3

It may not be a play for play of the way you believe the crucifixion went down, but it's probably pretty damn close.  Remember, this is a film based upon a book.  Any translation of a book to a movie gets a little jumbled-just ask Stephen King-and I don't see why the bible should be an exception to that rule.  Most people interpret the bible differently, so there's another reason why this film doesn't seem quite right to you.  Ya know, the bible is not a novel and isn't the best book when it comes to description and detail, so it's only logical to fill in those holes with what you feel seems most appropriate, and I'm sure this is what Mel did.  You'd do it to, and probably alot differently than most other people.  People have been whining about the violence as well.  Well, this film is about the crucifixion of Jesus, is it not?  Candy coating this event is okay to a two year old child(I went to a Lutheran preschool that had lots of pictures of a smiling cartoon Jesus caricature hanging on a cross), but we're adults here and we all know that getting beaten to a pulp and crucified isn't PG-13 material, especially when you think of the way the ancient Romans must have done it.  Before I saw this I was led to believe that the film was nothing but a 2 hour beating and an onslaught of gore.  I won't downplay the violence coz it is very violent, but there's really only one major beating scene that goes on for some time.  There's various beatings along the way, but one major bloody one, and it begins about 50 minutes into the film.  If you watch alot of horror films it may not be as shocking to you as with most other people.  Anyhow, with all religious philosophy put aside, I'll say the movie is good.  It's very well done, the performances are all good, the music is good.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie as a movie because that's what it is-A Movie.	4.0	It's A Movie	2004-09-08	4	4	0

This movie ascends all of that!  How dare a person think that simply mocking a brilliant piece of work like this could be downgraded to simple propaganda is beyond me. (...)  I think not.There's a reason why Mel Gibson is famous, wealthy and powerful.  It's because of films like Braveheart, Mad Max and The Passion that set him apart from so many other professionals who work in show business.  He doesn't just win the congeniality award, he IS the congeniality award!This film is a true work of art.  The violence.  The gore.  The bloodshed.  All very necessary for a film that is trying to make you look at something with both eyes and forces you to really think about what love really is.  It's all about sacrifice.  Whether Jesus really existed or not, this movie is clear in explaining that love is all about sacrifice and this movie shows every gory detail whether you like it or not.This film is the reason I love film!  It blankets the audience with absolutely no apologies which is something that is seriously missing in movies today.  I am thanking Mr. Gibson and his ICON productions for working so hard to bring this film to where it is today.

I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved.  If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality,  this film may have more substance.  Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve.  I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value.  Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining.

I was crying so much, felt like back in little boy, shouting in my heart, ""no more!  Please do no hurt Lord, that is enough!  please!"".  And again, even his flesh became so bloody and flesh under his skin was taken off by that violent whipping, he was still asking forgiveness.  Maybe most of people was shock on that scene.I was glad that not only Christians saw this, but other religion believers also watched and gave comments on this movie.  Yes, I believe it was just like horror, terror, and violent.  However, I don't believe that it was anti-semmitic, or not even telling Jewish killed him.  It was Lord's plan that he had to be torture.  If some people think this movie is against Jewish, Moslem, etc, that is something they are misunderstanding.  If that movie's concept was that way, He might curse them, might had hate Jewish Moslem, etc, however, then he would not be Jesus Christ anymore.  He taught us to love your neighbors.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	"Having done my best to resist the hype and controversy regarding ""The Passion of the Christ,"" I finally had the chance to view it on DVD.  It is a sturdy, beautifully-filmed version of a story that is eminently familiar to millions; the new spin here is the level of verisimilitude offered in depicting the last brutal hours leading to Christ's crucifixion.  And that's where the film is both brilliant and maddening.On the one hand, if its central message is that Jesus of Nazareth--whether one believes him to have been the son of God or simply a charismatic, visionary upstart--suffered a gruesome demise on behalf of his efforts, then showing suffering is absolutely critical to creating the proper catharsis about his sacrifice.  To that end, I found myself in tears several times, as well as filled with moments of joy and hope before the film ended, something that at my age doesn't happen from watching movies much anymore.On the other hand, I also wondered if everything I saw was truly necessary.  Too many films today have a pornographic fixation on violence, and the slow-motion shots and efforts to simultaneously mollify and shock with visceral images often tread into fetishism.  I found myself actually wondering while witnessing these moments if ""Bambi"" or ""Old Yeller"" were remade today, would we have 20-minute scenes of the demise of sympathetic characters not to illicit true emotions, but simply to appeal to some bloodthirsty part of ourselves that wants to see them.  (No, for those looking for an ax to grind, I'm not comparing the life of Christ to children's movies; I'm comparing the cinematic experience of creating deeply sympathetic characters that die to the notion of just how brutal their deaths must be to make us feel something profound.)If there are obvious weaknesses to the film, they are mostly technical.  Mel Gibson's direction is quite controlled and inspired, but like most contemporary filmmakers, he over-relies on the closeup, giving the film, as a friend later suggested, a claustrophobic feel.  John Debney's soundtrack is moving, even if some elements remind me of James Horner's ""Glory"" soundtrack.  Most of the cast is good, if thug-like or wan, and Jim Caveziel's Jesus, like Willem DaFoe's in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" is sympathetic but lacks the full virtue, kindness and profundity I associate with Christ.  In a word, he's just too ordinary (even if he's made up to look a little more like a product of the Middle East rather than Western Europe).Lastly, I've never understood how anyone can profess to love Jesus but still somehow have animus toward Jews--it just boggles the mind.  I don't believe ""The Passion of the Christ"" reinforces negative stereotypes, though there clearly are villains and tormentors represented here, and I'm sure some people will read into the characterizations what they will.  I found things pretty even-handed, with both sympathetic and unsympathetic characters of the faiths and ethnicities that share the spotlight in this film."	4.0	Almost a Truly Great Film	2005-04-18	12	9	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1FRRH0NNH78F	Stephen Sanders	Simply put, The Passion of the Christ is the greatest and moving Biblical film of all time. Whereas other films of its genre appear as stained glass windows come to life, this film pulses with a vibrance and intensity that has never before been seen in a film based on the Bible. It will surely set the bar for all future Biblical film.There are a number of points to address. First, the film takes pains to stay extremely close to the Gospels. Gibson does take some artistic liberties, but nowhere does anything occur that contradicts Scripture. Did Satan tempt Jesus in Gethsemane and taunt him on the road to Calvary? Did demon children plague Judas after the betrayal? Was Herod gay? The Bible never mentions these things but that does not mean that they couldn't have occured and indeed the Bible says that if everything about Jesus' life was written it would fill volumes of books. I particularly liked the fulfillment of the Genesis prophet about Man crushing the head of the serpent.Was the film overly violent? Time Magazine called the film the most violent and gory ever made. It may have been, although I think there are some slasher films that surpass it. It doesn't matter though. The film does not revel in violence or exhalt it in any way. Rather, it shows the agony that Christ endured for us. Anything less would have been a cop out.The final complaint against it is that it is anti-Semitic. This is certainly not the case. The film, like the Bible, shows that the Jewish priests wanted him dead. But even then, not all of them participated. Two of the priests left the arrest in protest. The film also clearly portrayed numerous sympathetic Jewish characters including, Mary, Mary Magdalane, the Apostles, Simon who bore Christ's cross, the soldier whose ear was cut off, and the crowds who mourned Christ as he carried his cross.In short, this movie forever changes the way Christiasn and non-Christians alike think about the story of Christ. Mel Gibson has done a great service by bringing this to the screen.	5.0	The greatest and most moving Biblical film ever created.	2004-02-27	4	3	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	Enough has been said to provide plenty of summaries, historical accuracy, religious prejudice and Mel Gibson's personality faults and traits.  I am only concerned with the quality of the transfer of this film's audio and video from Standard Def to Blu Ray.  Here goes.VIDEO....The transfer to Blu Ray is excellent.  Film grain is not noticeable anywhere and details in the many dark or shadow areas are clearly discernible.  Colors are rich and accurate with no false color grading that I could tell.  Most of the lighting used in the film was shot with fairly warm tones and, even though this films takes place in the mid East, you do not get that golden, overly bright color grading that you see in many of the war and espionage films that take place in the middle East i.e. The Green Zone, Jarhead, The Kingdom and many others.  At no time did I see any  artifacting or aliasing throughout the film.  The film is letterboxed with bars on top and bottom but that doesn't bother me.  Mbps rate tends to average in the lower to mid twenties.AUDIO...On Blu Ray you get a lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 audio codec that, though I was reading the English subtitles, provided for clean and transparent sound.  While there is some directional use of foley fx to the front sides, both the front and rear surrounds are primarily used for ambient crowd noise.  However, they used them well and the audio was definitely immersive in many scenes.  There are a great number of language subtitles to choose from and there is no English dubbing as Mr. Gibson had intended.EXTRAS...While I did not own the Standard Def version, I had seen it a couple of times and it appeared pretty clean to me at the time. Thus, I do not think that this film was wholly remastered for Blu Ray but I do believe that they reformatted it from a very clean mother master.  This is a 2 disc set, I watched the theatrical release.  The other version is supposed to have been edited for kids to see without being exposed to the many scenes of extreme violence and torture.  Other extras include 2 deleted scenes that come without any subtitles but I had no problem getting the gist of what the characters were saying.  The other extras surely came on the Standard Definition release as they were all in a 4:3 aspect ration.  These extras were interviews with Mel Gibson and cast regarding the writing, directing and acting within the film.  Basically, it is one long extra that has been cut into several sub chapters regarding the film.  One extra, which I did try, was a fact pop up which came on during the playing of the movie.  I was expecting historical facts or opinions but the pop ups were either biblical quotations or facts about the lighting, sets, or studio where scenes were shot.  Disappointed in that.All in all, while this is not a film I will watch frequently, the transfer to Blu Ray does deserve the 5 stars I gave it for its clean video and lossless audio.All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of a film's transfer and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase as well as any number of my other reviews might.Thanks for reading.	5.0	The Passion of the Christ, Definitive Edition, on Blu Ray	2013-09-24	6	5	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ARRAMXWT83PT	Steven Adam Renkovish	This has got to be the most powerful film that I have ever seen in my life. As a follower of Christ, I was utterly moved by every scene. It's the most graphic, realistic portrayal of the suffering Christ endured - and you will be moved like never before. As the credits rolled, the audience in the theatre sat for atleast ten minutes, and not one word could be heard.Mel Gibson has given us a masterpiece, and I am sure that it is going to change lives and/or allow people to see and understand the price that was paid for all of us on Calvary. As for the accusations of anti-Semitism, theres nothing here to back that up. This film is all about God's love, not hate or wrath. We are all responsible for the death of Christ because of our sin nature, and the film even depicts that in different ways. Jim Caveizel is perfect in the lead role, and his is the most loving portrayal of Jesus that I have ever seen in my life. All of the actors give superb performances.I have waited for so long for someone to make a film like this. Little did I know that it would be Mel Gibson. He has given us a powerful film, and with the help of the Lord above, this film finally saw the light of day and was released. I will be taking my lost friends to see it, and for those of us who are Christians already, it is VERY thought provoking, and you simply cannot shake it for days. This film haunted me like no other. Its not something you see to be entertained. You EXPERIENCE this. It feels as if you are right there watching it all happen before your eyes, and I simply cannot put into words the feelings that you feel while watching. I doubt that anyone could. I will be going to see this many times, and I will continue to support this film while it still runs in theatres. I suggest we all do the same.Go see it. You will never be the same again. Trust me.HIGHLY, HIGHLY, recommended.*Due to extreme graphic content, I would recommend this film ONLY to those who are in the 15 and up group.	5.0	The BEST film EVER!	2004-02-27	5	3	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" the most powerful film ever made about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, returns to DVD in this epic 2-Disc Definitive Edition! The film is presented with fantastic sound and picture quality. As with the previous DVD release, the viewer has the option to view the film without subtitles, the way Gibson originally intended. Also included from the previous DVD release is the audio track for the hearing impaired.Among the plethora of extras is the 2005 release ""The Passion Recut,"" a shorter and less intense version of the film. Although good, it lacks the power of the full-length cut. The first disc also features four commentary tracks with Mel Gibson, the crew, and noted theologians.Disc two features the documentary ""By His Wounds, We are Healed,"" an outstanding in-depth look at the making of this monumental film. Also featured are five featurettes that take a look at the historical and theological context of the film's message. Rounding out the extras are some interesting deleted scenes, trailers, and production images.For fans of the film, this is a truly fantastic DVD release for Gibson's masterpiece!

But Gibson swings the fictional pendulum toward gratuitous and graphic violence, and the story as well as Jesus get flayed to a bloody mess.

In a way that is extremely captivating the movie introduces fresh new takes on the drama. Drawing on newly revealed historical understanding of the timeperiod and even more importantly demonstrating an acute depth of biblical appreciation which has united so many varied groups to sing it's choruses, The Passion is a timeless landmark; causing each viewer to grapple with the deepest recesses of their mind & soul (Hear O' Israel) and resolve; have I understood, have I believed, have I responded, have I loved, have I imitated. Oh My God help me be like your Perfect Son.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"Never has the story of the death of Jesus been told with such visceral honesty, and never with such an absence of justifying context.  Who is this film for?  Gibson seems to have made the monumental assumption that the audience is so deeply familiar with the story of Jesus that he can happily jettison everything but the last 12 hours of the man's life and everyone will still ""get it"" nonetheless.  Catholics, no doubt, will get it: every moment will be ringing with monumental significance.  But for those of other faiths, or without one - or even for lapsed-Catholic agnostics like me - there's very little here to engage with.  A series of flashbacks give us some insight into the behaviour and emotions of the other characters, but falls far short of explaining why WE should care. Gibson's aim is admirable.  By focusing on the humanity and suffering of Jesus, and the unspeakable violence of his death, Gibson is pointing to the enormity of Christ's sacrifice.  Fair enough.  But without an equally powerful representation of the purpose of that sacrifice and of what Christians believe it achieved, the death of Jesus comes off looking remarkably pointless - and this film as remarkably self-indulgent."	2.0	Lack of context drains death of significance	2004-02-28	50	14	36

Very moving and true to the scriptures.For the believer, this is a must see movie that provides a great depiction of the events of Good Friday.  While not pretty to watch, it will make the following scriptures even more poignant as you see the price that was ALREADY paid for healing, forgiveness and reconciliation by the Lamb of God:Isaiah 50:6  I gave My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.Isaiah 53:4-6  But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.1 Peter 2:21-24  For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: "" Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth""; who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness -- by whose stripes you were healed.Zechariah 12:9-11  ""And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn.For the non-believer, it should be even more uncomfortable to watch.  There's clearly a message for them too.  It's the very same message provided to the Pharisees and Sadducees which rejected their Messiah.Psalm 118:22  The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.Psalm 14:1 (repeated Psalm 53:1)  The fool says in his heart, ""There is no God."" They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.Isaiah 6:9-10 (The Message)  He said, ""Go and tell this people: 'Listen hard, but you aren't going to get it; look hard, but you won't catch on.'Make these people blockheads, with fingers in their ears and blindfolds on their eyes, so they won't see a thing, won't hear a word, so they won't have a clue about what's going on and, yes, so they won't turn around and be made whole.""And the whole argument over whether or not Mel Gibson depicted the Jews as evil is just plain ignorant.  Jesus is a Jew.  His disciples and his mother and brothers were Jews.  It wasn't the Jews, or even the Romans, that nailed Christ to the Cross.  It was our sins.  And neither Jew nor Roman was able to force Him to go through the Passion.  He did so willingly!1 Peter 2:24  ""He himself bore our sins"" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness;""John 1:29  The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, ""Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!""John 10:17-18  ""Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.  No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father.""The message that He preached to the religious leaders, priests, lawyers, fishermen, tax collectors, soldiers, and whores, Jews and Gentiles alike, 2,000 years ago is the very same Gospel (good news) for today.Luke 4:15-21  He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: ""The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.""  Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.  He began by saying to them, ""Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.""Hebrews 13:8  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.2 Corinthians 6:2  For He says: ""In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you.""  Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.And the question that Christ asked His disciples is the same one He asks of everyone.  It's up to each of us to respond with our own lips.Mark 8:27-29,31  Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, ""Who do men say that I am?"" So they answered, ""John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.""  He said to them, ""But who do you say that I am?""  Peter answered and said to Him, ""You are the Christ.""  ...And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.Just as depicted in the ""Passion of the Christ.""  So, what's your answer?Romans 10:8-13  But what does it say? ""The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,"" that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: If you declare with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, ""Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.""  For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, ""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.""Hopefully, you do so in this life rather than after.Romans 14:9,11-12  For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living. ...For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  For it is written: "" As I live, says the LORD, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.""  So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.Philippians 2:6-11  Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.  And being found in appearance as a human being, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death -- even death on a cross!  Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."	5.0	Who do you say that I AM?	2009-02-13	5	2	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1PJAX7WONEPVX	Steve Zagurny	I did not like the sub title use.  I feel it takes away from the flow of the film.  The DVD should have had English as a language.  Some of the violence seem contrived and silly.  When Jesus is forced to fall over the edge of a bridge that Peter just happens to be hiding under...yeh, right!  The majority of the abuse seems pretty realistic.  The androgenous devil is spooky as is the demonic images that various people see (ie:Judas). As a Catholic, I found the movie less than the inspirational powerhouse others have reported.  It is still worth watching.	4.0	a little less than expected	2004-11-12	14	7	7

The acting was flawless and it was very easy to identify as a Mother myself, with Mary the Mother of Jesus, watching helplessly as events unfolded.  Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel can only be commended for such an outstanding film and performance.  As a Catholic, and a Mother I didnot find the film overly violent, it has to be seen in the context of the time it was set and the sacrifice made by Jesus for all of us.  As for being anti semitic - I would totally refute that claim, except to say that just because we may not like the course history took, does not mean we can re write it.  I hope and pray that this film will be the beginning of conversion within the Catholic and Christian community.  This film was made with the love and grace of God by people deserving of our love and gratitude.  Man makes time for the things he loves, now is the time to love God and make time for Him - this film is the beginning for the whole world.	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-02-29	1	1	0

This film is a story and a portrayal of the Passion.I don't wear religion on my shirt sleeve. In the secular day to day existence  of America, we have peer bias against religion. So, out in the world of commerce, I keep this part of my life private.The history of the life of Jesus Christ doesn't fit the convention investigative techniques by which I learned my stock and trade. The life of Christ does make sense using a different paradigm of history - the model of how people kept track of events before we had IBM PCs.Now, some things you cannot explain. But, explain it or not, we know the truth. That's correct. Deep down inside we know the reality - the what is of existence. This film operates in that zone.The quality of the portrayal reflects the remarkable film making of Mel Gibson and his fabulous cast and crew. Even if you don't believe, I strongly recommend the film. Just for the art form, the Passion of the Christ gets the job done.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ETUNYLSMOAU6	"Strephon Kaplan-Williams ""writer"""	How could anyone sit there and watch so much suffering and violence? We still have restrictions on seeing genital sex in main line movies. Why was so much laceration of the body, the terrible beatings and so on allowed and even praised by so many monvie goers and Christians? This is not about the historical Jesus which I have studied. This is melodrama. I found it hard to believe and recognized the gobs of body paint on the actor. This actor lacks strength and character so it was not believable that he was taking so much violence. The point of Jesus' suffering on the cross was that he had character and consciousness not to focus on the suffering happening to his body or the ending of his existence, but to refuse being drugged with wine and to give ultimate focus to his betrayal by those around him and by God, as when he says his last lines, My God, My God why have you utterly betrayed me? And dies. The Passion of Mel Gibson lacks the development of character of Jesus and so this renders the ending violence unbelievable. We have lost our sense of reality when we get caught up in images and lose sight of the character of a person. If you want to see the pornography of violence but without the real Jesus of history, then you can buy the video. I know something of what I am talking about from thrity-five years now working with the historical Jesus material and practicing living the teachings in my own life though I am in no sense a Christian. You won't find the real Jesus in this film. It is a good lesson in what not to do. Don't let yourself be taken in by the visuals or the melodramatic acting.

This is not really a movie, but an event, designed to evoke a visceral response.  To me, that just wasn't very satisfying or impressive.This movie could have been so much better, and meant so much more.  I'd like to think that I am not so obtuse as to need two straight hours of witnessing torture to understand that Jesus suffered enormously.  My favorite parts of the movie were the flashbacks, where Jesus reminisces of sermons or events from his life.  This is where we get to identify with Cavaziel's character and establish some sort of connection.  This is where Gibson could have presented his view of what Jesus was really like and what he wanted to teach us.  But, alas, these flashbacks account for only 5% or so of the movie.  Had they been far more numerous, and accounted for 85% or more of the movie, it would have made all the difference.  The events of the torture and crucifiction provided a powerful context, but it alone was not a substantial message warranting a two hour movie.  This is where the movie really fell short.All that said, I can't recommend it or not recommend it.  This is a movie that many will have a deep emotional response to.  If you think you'd be one of them, then by all means- see it.  If not, then you likely won't get much from it, as it poses no questions and presents no answers.

The flash backs of His life, and of those who were watching the 'death walk' were very powerful. I see no reason for all the dislike over this movie 'based solely' on the subject matter of 'Who Jesus Christ is?' The movie is well written and directed - the way one man's life ended and what He and His family/friends went through in those last hours at the hands of a brutal military and an out of control mob.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ARE0HV5FEFXO7	"Super ""wordfood"""	"Due to a commitment my family has made not to view ""R"" rated movies, my husband and I decided to see this movie ""edited"".  I must say that the impact that this movie apparently had on people must have been attributed mainly to the violence, because having much of that edited out, the movie was left wanting in my eye's.  I don't WANT to see graphic violence however (even though graphic it may have been in real life) and I wish more had been shown about his life and teachings.  My absolute favorite part of the movie was when Jesus was building his table and chairs, along with all other flashbacks.  I didn't decide to see this movie to be ""enlightened"" but rather out of curiousity.  Anyone who has a sound understanding of the biblical accounts of Christ's life will not learn anything new from this movie.  I realize however, that many whose relationship with Christ is weak will probably be impacted by seeing what he went through for us in movie form.  My view is that much more can be learned through studying the bible itself and through prayer.  An even greater understanding of our Savior's life and mission can be obtained through more intimate channels, prayer, meditaion, revelation.  I give credit to Mel Gibson though, and believe that his intentions were sincere, not selfish.  This movie is not anti-semetic.  To say so is to show that one's understanding of the scriptures is lacking.  Christ was a Jew, so were many of those who followed him, so were many of those who brought about his death.  A reminder though, He gave up his life.  No one took it from him.  If your curious about the politics and people that participated in the Lord's death, I suggest a marvelous documentary novel called Pontius Pilate, by Paul Maier.  Also, for those who seek a more spiritually uplifting movie about Christ, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has put out a film called ""Finding Faith in Christ"".  It is not quite hollywood material of course, but comes close and is very well made for a religious film.  It is biblical in content as well.  You can get a FREE copy of the film by calling 1-800-443-9911 or on the website [...]  Seriously, it's absolutely FREE! I've enjoyed it in my dvd library."	3.0	Hmmm	2004-09-13	6	0	6
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2TFWLHE25JD06	Surrounded	"Gibson's goal in this film was to re-ignite the pogroms by showing Jesus' suffering as exaggerated and bloody as possible, and blaming the Jewish people for it.  In the scene where Pilate asks the crowd what Jesus has done to merit execution, the crowd responds by taking the guilt for his death upon themselves and their descendants.  This is in the Aramaic dialogue, but was not shown in the English subtitled version for the U.S.  It was, however, dutifully translated for the versions shown in other countries.  It's a credit to audiences worldwide that they did not take the bait.Part of the reason for this is that ""Passion of the Christ"" is nothing more than gore pornography, not much different than ""The Human Centipede"" except for its setting and choice of subject matter.  Much of the film's box-office take was the result of teenage boys going back to see it...over and over and over, like teenage girls and ""Titanic.""  The religious message, assuming Gibson even had one, was lost in the gleeful bloodbath that takes up most of the film.Ultimately, the film was the result of Gibson's attempt to resolve the primary conflict of his psyche - his fervent belief that the Holocaust never took place, and his profound regret that it was not more effective."	1.0	The Passion of Mel Gibson's Jew-Hatred	2012-11-23	21	6	15

It is hard to watch and some scenes are frighteningly graphic, but that is the whole point of this story.  We sometimes tend to ""gloss"" over the Crucifixion, thinking only of the goodness (Easter, God's love and grace).  We tend to forget how very much Christ suffered for us.  Not only was the physical torment horrifying and and heart-wretching, but He took on every sin we ever had or ever will have.  Imagine having the sins of murderers, child-molesters, and every form of human evil there is thrust upon you --- along with being beaten unrecognizable and hung upon a cross.  It is simply more than we, as mere humans, can ever possibly imagine.  Seeing this torment that He endured for us should (and does) make us feel humble, guilty, and overwhelmed with what He did for us.  This is a powerful, moving film - and I have watched it numerous times, and cannot make it through without bursting into tears.

Where was the rampant anti-semitic acts that were to happen because of the this simple little film? As far as the papers were concerned, the sky was supposed to fall after this movies release. Instead a wave of love spread through out our nation. People from all walks of life were brought together by this film to celebrate their faith and witness the raw and inspiriring portrayal of the life and death of Jesus Christ. Christians everywhere were supposed to suddenly hate the Jews after watching this movie, instead something else happened. Christians everywhere showed their intelligence and good will and understood that this film had NO such message. All of that talk and concern, over nothing, all it did was take away from the REAL story about this movie. The story of a God that loved man enough to sacrifice himself for us.

Mel Gibson himself said it best last Thursday on the tonite show when Jay Leno asked him if he expected this much controversy on the film, Gibson said: ""I expected that I might hit a nerve but I didn't expect to pop a capillary.""People who have seen The Passion rave about it. They say it is great. They indicate that they have come out of the theatre crying (and these are tough people!) so I feel that if this movie demonstrates how Jesus Christ suffered and died for us, if in fact that message gets across then The Passion is deserving of five stars.Many religious leaders across the country are high in aclaim for this movie feeling that it is a realistic demonstration on how Jesus Christ was crucified.Regarding kids, parents should indeed heed the R-rating. I have been told that The Passion is very violent and gory. Crucifixions are not pretty. This movie is somewhat like the stations of the cross showing the 13 stations up to and including the crucifixion. Perhaps Mel Gibson will produce a sequel showing the most imortant part, the Resurection of Jesus Christ.LASTLY, keep in mind that this is just a movie. It is not scripture.

Here are some of my thoughts and his, as I detailed them to my congregation one month BEFORE the movie was even released to the public. I believe my review is even more relevant one year later...I believe this movie will bring the person and death of Jesus Christ to our world like few others have done in the past. It will reintroduce what Jesus endured to our own post-Christian country. Though embellished by Gibson in a few parts, it is a substantially more accurate account and vivid depiction of what Jesus endured during the last hours of His earthly life than most other films about Christ. It is the best film on Jesus I've ever seen, even though it focused largely on the last twelve hours of His life. It was a very descriptive and moving motion picture. Even though it was filmed in three languages of Jesus day (Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin) with English subscripts, I was mesmerized by the power of the visual message. Do you want to know the Truth about the sufferings and crucifixion? See the film!The Passion Of The Christ is a biblical retelling of the betrayal, trials, suffering, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, detailing the last 12 hours of His earthly life, artfully intertwining flashbacks to earlier moments in His life and ministry. The film is a project in which Gibson invested 12 years of his life and $25 million dollars of his own funds. As a director and Academy Award-Winning Actor, Gibson, who is credited with such movies as Braveheart, The Patriot, and Forever Young, explained to our pastoral audience, ""I had to do this movie. It was a calling, I did not have a choice.""Nationally known Christian leaders like Billy Graham, Chuck Colson, James Dobson, and Bill Bright have endorsed this movie as one of the most truthful and inspiring depictions of Christ's suffering and death on film to date. I agree. For this reason, it has been rated R for ""graphic violence. In this case, rated R stands more for Realistic. Nevertheless, I strongly urge adults to preview the movie before bringing younger people to see it. I think the content is too graphic or mature for all children 12 or under.After the preview concluded, Gibson was interviewed by nationally known Christian author and award-winning journalist, Lee Strobel (""The Case For Christ""). While Strobel's questions covered a wide range of serious topics about this biblical drama, Gibson often brought the crowd of clergy to laughter with his lighthearted humor. For example, Strobel asked Gibson, ""Why did you choose the actor Jim Caviezel to play the role of Jesus? Gibson wittingly answered, It's because he's thirty-three years old and his initials are J.C.!""On a more solemn note, when asked about the criticism the movie is already receiving from some Jews, Muslims, and theological liberals, Gibson replied, ""I'm sorry if some people are offended by the truth. The film is historically true, though I did take some poetic license in a few parts. My concern in making the film was to be authentic, right down to cultural customs and practices. Other films about Jesus haven't always done that. At times they have even depicted him with blonde hair and blue eyes. My film is based upon the historical accounts of the Bible. I don't understand those people who don't believe the Bible as history. The Gospel writers were eyewitnesses. It's not only history; it's the Word of God. I didn't make this up! I also consulted with many bible scholars about the film.""As far as the personal reasons for producing this film, Gibson passionately confessed, ""The film was born at a turning point in my life 12 years ago, when I was literally looking down from a 15-story window. Something wasn't right. I had all the fame and money in the world, but I had to make a choice, whether or not getting out of this frying pan was just jumping into another. At that point, I re-examined the Truth. Christ's wounds healed my wounds.""Speaking of movie reviews, I completed a 10-CD message series at Lake Almanor Community Church (where I pastor), answering the 9 most asked questions by Americans about Gibson's movie and Jesus, titled, ""The Passion Of The Christ: True Or False?."" (1) What was Jesus' crime? (2) Who was Jesus really? (3) Why did Jesus have to suffer and die? (4) Can a person who lived 2000 years ago really free me from my past? (5) Is Jesus the only way to God? (6) Is the Bible reliable and truthful? (7) How can I follow a God I will eventually disappoint? (8) Who killed Jesus? (9) Did Jesus really rise from the dead? In my answers to these questions I give the historical, archaeological, and manuscript evidence for Jesus, who He was, what He did, and why His death has importance for your life. You can order the message series through our web page at lacconline.org or by calling the Church at 530-596-3683. (By the way, I don't make one dime on any of the sales. I made the series because I believe the average American doesn't know how much real evidence there is for Jesus. Unfortunately, most announce verdicts about Jesus without truly looking at the evidence.)Bottom line, see the movie.

But as a free-thinking human being, I cannot for the life of me understand the cult of personality around this heinous piece of celluloid.I suspected, from everything I'd heard about it, that I would hate it - but I finally gave in and rented it long after it had been on DVD. I still feel, to this day, that Mel Gibson sinned against me and hope that God forgives him and the people who made this trash profitable.Sorry, but I would not worship a diety based on how much physical punishment he puts his human son through - which, come to think of it, sort of makes The Passion of the Christ a less fun version ofClash of the Titans (Keepcase). Christ is not an epic mythological figure because he knows how to take a beating. (That would make himRocky.)The best cinematic version of the Bible story is and probably will always beThe Last Temptation of Christ, which is, of course, universally reviled amongst the evangelistic community. Unfortunately, that book (The Last Temptation of Christ) and movie require a subtlety and appreciation of the human condition far beyond their capacity. It should be the considered the fullest, most reverent telling of Christ's life, not Mel Gibson's heresy.But unlike Mel Gibson, I haven't been married twice, fathering children with two women who are no longer my wives, or cursed out Jews or made lascivious comments during a DUI.

I couldn't quite follow what that guy from Thin Red Line and Frequency had done wrong.  The details were rather sketchy so I still feel that I was not able to piece it all together.  But, the film was sooo beautiful that it hardly even bothered me that I was lost.  Kudos to the cineamatographer!!!One question: Jesus?  Who's Jesus?I also felt that it was a little too bloody.  I heard somewhere that people who are religious were taking young children to see this film.  I cannot condone this, for a lot of the film centers around one man being brutally tortured.  It is more violent than any other Mel Gibson movie I have seen including the Lethal Weapon movies and Braveheart.  Please don't take your children to see this movie!!!  It is a reminder of all that is violent in the world, and I must stress that this is real violence that is depicted, not CARTOON VIOLENCE!If you liked this movie, check out Dogma by Kevin Smith, another great movie that has religious themes, but is not dominated with blood, guts and gore.  It is closer to a family film because of the lighthearted nature, but some of the language may not be acceptable to all young ears.If you or your family is offended by the ""F word,"" the ""S word,"" and the ""H-E-double hockey stick word,"" I recommend that you skip Dogma and go right for the Passion.  None of those vile and obsence words appear in the Passion at all.

I am a Christian, Baptist to be exact, and I know the story of Jesus' crucifixion pretty well. So, when I heard about this movie, I immediately looked up everything I could about it. This just served to get me more excited to see this movie! We got to the theater, and I was feeling a bit uneasy, even though I'm a Christian, and I knew what was coming. So, I settled in with a Sprite, and completely forgot it was there after the movie started! I ended up crying at the start of the movie before anything major even happened! One scene in particular that was extremely moving for me, was the scene where Jesus is flogged. How, he had the courage to stand up again after being beaten like that is beyond me! If you don't know anything about a Roman flogging in those times, watch this movie and you'll see just how brutal they were. I cannot wait until this movie comes out on Aug. 31, as I will be getting that day. A word of caution though, please, if you watch this, do so with an open mind, and be willing to be changed!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2D63RN5LF14R2	"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER"""	"Mel Gibson's 2004 ""Lethal Jesus"" seems an all too vivid symbol of what exactly is wrong with the bankruptcy of authentic spirituality in film."" Indeed, for this to pass itself off as a ""spiritual film"" is something akin to a satanic theology. This film's vision was first seen in a Jack T. Chick fundamentalist comic tract from the 1970&#8242;s which depicted the Passion with a suffering Christ who looked like Hamburger Helper as hooked nosed Jews screamed for his death. The same company produced numerous, blatantly anti-Semitic tracts, including one in which a Rabbi was fried in the fires of hell by a faceless God, sitting on a large white throne. I saw I a similar-minded passion play in which a muscle bound Jesus got involved in a barroom type brawl (in his descent to Hell) with demons who looked suspiciously like caricatured Jews, dressed in black with false noses. Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ "" is a 21st century manifested promotion for the medieval lynch mob, which precedes it.Gibson's frighteningly pedestrian take on the passion is a far cry from the spirituality in cinema espoused by master Andrei Tarkovsky. ""Passion of the Christ"" also sits on the polar opposite end of films such as ""Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928), ""City Lights"" (1931), ""The Song of Bernadette"" (1943), "" The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" (1966), ""Andrei Rublev"" (1973 and  ""The Mission"" (1986).When this was released theatrically, churches took their congregations by the busload to see it. Corporate giants like Wal-Mart stocked their shelves by the hundreds of thousands with the DVD. You could purchase your ""Passion of the Christ"" movie to take home and enjoy for family viewing, along with ""Passion"" merchandised plastic spikes. Amazingly, there was no fast food tie-in deals, The movie as a marketing event has never seen such a shameful moment because it was ""this"" movie.It is well known now that Gibson and his Holocaust denying pappy actually belong to a splinter Catholic group which, among other things, still insists on women covering their heads during mass and has rejected Vatican II's rejection of referring to Jews as ""Christ-Killers.""When numerous critics pointed out the overwhelming Antisemitism of the film, they were pounced on by apostles of James Caviezel's ""Take it like a man"" Americanized macho Jesus who is completely alien to the Christ of the Beatitudes. No apologies were issued to those spoil sport critics when Gibson's Antisemitism became common public knowledge because the religious right arrogantly presumes it is the sole owner of the faith and Church, with nothing to apologize for. Gibson's Passion is as twisted, ugly and spewing as the hooknose ""Jews"" he grossly misrepresents in the film.Blame shifts entirely from Roman procurator Pontius Pilate to the Jews, despite historical documentation for Pilate's ruthless lack of mercy. In this, the film echoes Christendom, elevating Pilate to near saint. After all, it was Rome who gave the official stamp of approval. Echoing Christendom's big, wrong turn, yet again, the film entirely shifts a 2000 year old blame and, through caricaturization, the door is swung wide open for the much bullied upon high school geeks (Christianity) to become the new, improved and licensed bullies. Gibson targets the Jews, of course. The Jews are in league with a very fem looking Satan who, later, actually morphs into a woman and produces a reptilian sidekick, both of whom come off as hackneyed rejects from George Lucas' execrable second ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Of course, effeminacy is certainly the root of all evils and, quite obviously, a Jewish trait. Gibson expressed those views previous in a scene depicting Prince Edward from the Academy Award winning ""Braveheart"" (1995). The Jews in ""Passion of the Christ"" are also in league with the excruciatingly Jewish Judas Iscariot, who is the sole apostle here that tactlessly refers to Jesus as? his ""Rabbi.""In this version of the Passion, Christ and his apostles did not evolve from Judaism, they were, with the exception of Judas, never Jewish to begin with. Gibson even manages to outdo Richard Wagner in re-writing history in order to suit one's hate inspired agenda, but at least Wagner could produce great art. Gibson's film takes a sublime, existential, metaphoric icon: the Stations of the Cross, and transforms it into race bating pornography for fundamentalists. Even Peter is transformed from a very human apostle who, through immense struggles and missteps, became the rock of the Church, into a pre-made rock who comes across more like a Sylvester Stallone styled first century cop. One keeps expecting to see Our Lady; She-Devil of the SS. Like much in the post Vatican II Church that aspires, in part, to ""progressively"" morph back into the pre-Vatican II Church, Gibson avoids an real emphasis on Our Lady and drops her organic, spiritual presence like a hot potato. He-man misogyny and Antisemitism are bows on Gibson's ""gift to the world.""Ironically, this ""Wrath of Jesus"", with a medieval agenda, connected most to fundamentalist protestants, or perhaps, it's not so ironic after all. In choosing to bypass the whole of Christ's startling, diaphanous, radical and uncompromising, charismatic message of love and forgiveness, Gibson takes his dirty magnifying glass and hones in on the bloodshed detail, expanding it far beyond what Gospel writers ever fathomed.Gibson's passion play is a grimy, ultra violent video game (complete with a Garden of Gethsemane straight out of a George Romero 'Dead' movie). It is packaged by a brand of corporate Christendom and sold as a bill of goods that takes us to a ""new level in realism"" because ""this is what Jesus went through for you "", all the while fanning the medieval and fascist flames in stylized post ""Matrix"" Christian propaganda.""Passion of the Christ"" is mockingly titled because there isn't an ounce of passion in this film. It is a dumbed down, two-hour scourging completely removing us from Christ, the compassionate revolutionary. Here, the historical flesh and blood Jesus of Nazareth is reduced to a one dimensional cardboard deity who can take whatever is physically dished out because, unlike you and I, he is a god. What is missing is the human soul and tragedy of the Nazarene. If Christ were simply a divine figure who endured suffering, we would not be discussing him two millennium later, nor we would still be grappling to come to terms with the meaning of his life and death.The complex Christ of the gospels is, at times, paradoxically irritable, empathetically patient to human folly, aloof, accessible, matriarchal, patriarchal, an inspiring leader, servile, the quintessential outcast, communal, philosophical, emotionally charged, ambiguous, crystal clear, fearful, bravely determined, devoted to his mother, and impatient with her. The Christ of the four gospels is divine because he is the most human of humans.Even in solely focusing on the passion of the Christ, which Gibson's film purports to do, these qualities are still vividly present in the gospel accounts and in the countless artistic depictions of the Stations of the Cross. A visit to a random half dozen parishes will reveal an illuminating, rich diversity in the Stations iconography, ranging from the traditional to modern and post-modern representations. The beauty of the Catholic tradition can be found in its expansive egalitarianism. This egalitarianism is metaphorically expressed in the journeyed stations, which confirm and celebrate the humanity of Christ for the laity.Carl Theodore Dreyer's ""Passion of Joan of Arc"" honed in on the passion of its subject without dehumanizing her, quite the contrary. Unfortunately, Gibson did not follow Dreyer's example. Instead, Christ' life and ministry are substantially missing meat in a film superficially charged with the odor of divine, flayed flesh. Gibson's film is so lost in its hierarchal simple mindedness that the egalitarian celebration of humanity, found in the Stations, eludes him.Gibson's recent tirades and outbursts are not surprising at all when viewing this film. Indeed, this is an instance where one cannot separate the creator from his work because Gibson's militant misogyny and Antisemitism underpin every single frame of this ""Passion"" as much as Carl Orff's fascist leanings underpin the bawdy, militaristic ""Carmina Burana.""By comparison, Picasso's ""Guernica"" is a work of art that inspiringly captures the sense of startlement towards the horrors inflicted in this world; the kind of startlement that Christ must have felt when he realized he had gone too far and was doomed to be murdered by his frightened, confused, beloved brethren. Gibson's film is the equivalent of anti-Guernica. Instead of inspiring empathy or a sense of human identity, which is what it should do, Gibson's film retroactively harks back to ""us vs. them.""The Gospels imply that Christ ""learned"" from the Samaritan woman. Gibson's Christ is incapable of learning, especially from a weak and sinful woman. According to Gibson, Christ's death is not the consequence for bravely espousing a world-changing message. Gibson's Jesus undergoes two hours of torture to ""teach"" us a lesson about what it takes to be a god and this is depicted as penance for our human wretchedness. Gibson even counts himself among the wretched, undeserving of Christ' sacrifice, by utilizing his own hand to hammer a nail into the flesh of Christ. Naturally, Gibson widely publicized that fact, making himself oh so humble. He sold us his ""sincerity"" in his incessant publicizing that he financed the film himself. Predictably, the sheeple masses bought it all the way, as they virtually do everything mass marketed. The middle aged multi-millionaire artist as humble saint has rarely rang so arrogant or so phony. Gibson serves as his own elitist pope.Gibson's carefully placed and publicized hand takes on a masturbatory symbol in this exercise of titillation. Titillation equals pornography, and ""Passion of the Christ"" is pornography reprehensibly promoted and sold as an artistic vision. I have yet to see a pornographic film which can actually qualify as art and Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" certainly does not qualify as art and, like most pornography, it reduces itself to a series of unimaginative vignettes, climaxing with one repetitious, dull money shot after another, appeasing an audience of Christian thugs.However, contrary to what Gibson and his like-minded supporters think, the ""money shot"" is not in the orgasmic, titillating climax, it is in the loving, intimate embrace afterword, which pornography always (and predictably) fails to show. The money shot is in that moment when two people in love, after having made love, fall asleep, one's head resting on the other's chest, entwined in their bed together. Oh, Gibson does, all too briefly, depict the fifteenth station; the Resurrection, but, after two plus hours of grinding, one had better give more than a three second embrace in the loving comfort of the ascension. ""Passion of the Christ"", naturally, fails to do that and it is, ultimately, an immature, mud and tractor pull styled adolescent fantasy aimed for attention span challenged moviegoers, fundie porn hounds, and their boxes of Kleenexes."	1.0	A SATANIC THEOLOGY	2011-02-17	11	4	7

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A31ACI0E88ORDE	The Great White Father	"Well, ultimately that's really what this is--that isn't a condemnation, either, as that helps us be contemplative of what's going on here.  Likewise, we're likely to have the same experience because this is in two ancient languages: Aramaic and Latin.I think some of the violence was overdone, but it could have been a lot worse--and it's about time we saw a Jesus film that did justice to at least what is cinematic about Our Lord's suffering: His physical suffering, in other words.  This goes a long way in feeling like documentary footage, and yet it feels mystical, both with its haunting score and with the choice of slow motion at times.I think some of my biggest problems were some things I didn't understand the need for, but the worst are probably where the Tradition appears to have been changed: for example, Jesus appears to be scourged a LOT more than 39 times--in fact, I've read that medical experts have said that the real Jesus probably suffered physically a lot less than we see here.  That is, what we see here is more than enough to have killed Him.  Worse than this, though, is that the Romans who are scourging Our Lord have to be told specifically to stop it, that they were not to scourge Him to death.I'll take a brief side note to address the slanderous accusations of ""anti-Semitism"" in this movie.  I am Catholic by faith, and Jewish by ethnicity, and I saw no anti-Semitism.  A Roman does pejoratively call Simon of Cyrene ""Judaeus!""  (""Jew!""), but it's clear that our sympathies are to lie with Simon, and with Christ, not with that Roman.  The closest thing to anti-Semitism that I saw was the boys who hound Judas, but I'm not even sure to what degree that's even supposed to be what's really happening, rather than in Judas's imagination.  It's clear that Satan is riling up Jews and Romans alike, and as bad as Jews get here, those portrayed the worst are Romans (though not across the board, so there is no anti-Romanism or anti-Italianism here either).  After all, the worst Jews do to Jesus is beat Him up with their fists and chains, but it is Romans who not only scourge Him (which is historically accurate), but who seem to get a sadistic pleasure out of it, rather than doing what they were ordered to do and at most showing hatred or contempt for this self-proclaimed ""King of the Jews"".  The point anyway is Jesus and His suffering, how God turned the greatest evil of Deicide into the greatest good, a Holy Sacrifice to take away the sins of the world.  Why should the depiction of Jews matter more than God, or more than Romans/Italians?  I don't hear people complaining about the film being anti-Jewish because it says Jesus is the Son of God (which is what bothered Caiaphas et al about Jesus), nor do I hear the Italian anti-defamation league up in arms over the portrayal of Romans.  So why the cries of anti-Semitism?  We say religious tolerance is a good thing: why does this not apply to Catholics or evangelical Protestants?Having left behind that nonsense, I like the choice of actors here--I didn't see Jim Caviezel, I saw Jesus Christ (and I'd seen Jim Caviezel in Frequency before this).  I also like Maia Morgenstern's dignified portrayal of the Virgin Mary, even through Her suffering of com-Passion.  I also liked the portrayals of Peter, John, and Mary Magdalene, and Simon of Cyrene.  And this depiction of Satan was very effective.However, I counted Jesus falling more than three times, so that I lost count with regard to which Station of the Cross we're seeing.  Nor did I think it was necessary to dislocate His shoulder to nail His right hand to the Cross.  Also, while I don't know for sure, I would have thought the seven words on the Cross would have been in a different order than what we see here exactly.  Also, we don't see Jesus buried in the tomb, and the Resurrection scene is ambiguous, and not as well done as I would have liked.Having said that, however, one thing I especially appreciated was when the centurion pierces Our Lord's side and the Blood and water literally SPRAY out.  That, I think, is how it ought to be: His lungs had filled up, and so it makes sense that there would have been a burst, and the centurion would have been baptized with it--rather than, as in many depictions, simply showing the Blood and water slowly dripping down.Probably the worst thing about the movie overall is that it wouldn't be the best evangelizing tool--it's mostly for those who are already familiar with it, to strengthen our faith.  That's not a bad thing, it just means the film isn't as universal as it might be.  I say it wouldn't be the best evangelizing tool because, while Christ's message is not entirely absent, it is not necessarily as present as it might be.  We see a flashback of Jesus giving His Sermon on the Mount, telling us to love our enemies, and He gives commands to His disciples at the Last Supper, and of course there is Satan's temptation of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, so that this depiction is not anonymous.  Then again, it's in a language we don't understand, so without subtitles we might get lost--and yet because this is in two languages, we might miss something if we rely entirely on the subtitles (like Pilate addressing Jesus in Aramaic and Jesus responding in Latin).All in all, it has its flaws, but it's an excellent movie to watch any Friday, especially during Lent and most especially on Good Friday.God bless you all."	4.0	Less a movie than moving vignettes of the Sorrowful Mysteries and Stations of the Cross	2014-04-25	3	1	2

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A330Q95YYRB0VL	"The historian ""J-Man"""	The Passion of the Christ in my view was done in amazing detail and deserves wide reconition for it's cinamatic performance. It is not a movie you can say that you enjoyed or liked; but one that has an objective view of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ and paints the picture like it truely was.While watching the movie, I was not motivated one bit to have one ounce of hate towards the Jewish people or anyone else for that matter. I did shed tears when watching this--you couldn't help it, the way they portray Jesus willing to suffer so horribly for the sins of man kind--in which is why He was put to death, to atone for us. If anyone should be mad at someone, look at yourself. It was because of US that He died and was crucified, not the Jews.And just a little side note: If some Christians beleive Jew's are to blame for the death of Jesus...apparently they forget that the Gospels say that HE ROSE AGAIN! So technically, He is not dead but in heaven. Just a thought.Yes, as a historian I did see some historical inacuracies in clothing styles and the laungage. At the time of Jesus the Romans would not have spoken Latin, but a dialect of Greek that was prevailant at the time. (refer to St Paul's letters for varification) Other than that, Mel Gibson's movie was true to the Gospels one hundred precent and deserves a round of applause for such a great presentation.	5.0	The Passion and all it's contreversy	2004-08-18	8	8	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	"I've read that a prominent religious figure said that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST could be the best evangelism tool in 2000 years.While the 1977 mini-series JESUS OF NAZARETH is my favorite rendering of the life of Christ, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely the most vivid, disturbing version of his suffering and death.Mel Gibson has made a bold, bloody and (yes) beautiful film that's obviously from his heart and soul.  That a Hollywood actor would invest his own money and risk his career to tell this particular story--knowing the wrath that would follow--is truly worthy of all the praise the media is refusing to give him.  He's been attacked by everyone from the New York Times to Howard Stern.  Hollywood was also critical--until the box office numbers came out (the sudden praises of tinsel town types proves that $$$ is the god of Hollywood).As far as the charges of anti-Semitism go, I'm always bewildered by anyone claiming to be a ""Christian"" who hates Jews.  Mel Gibson said in his interview with Diane Sawyer that to be anti-Semitic is incompatible with true Christianity and a ""sin.""  I heartily agree.  Jesus was a Jew!  I just don't get it.I've been following the story of this film for well over a year and have read how most media people thought THE PASSION would be Mel's folly.  When I'd heard that Mel was originally going to release the film in Aramaic and Latin without subtitles, I had to wonder myself.But what I find so despicable in the media is, now that the film's a blockbuster, some journalists and talking heads (like Andy Rooney) are accusing Mel of making the film purely for profit!  Unbelievable!I saw the film opening weekend and I was amazed at the sold-out audience who saw it with me.  I can't recall ever seeing a movie that stunned its audience and held it in such silence.  My own gut was knotted up nearly the whole time.  There have been films that led us to moments of tears and silence, but the introspection and tension of this film occured for nearly its entire running length.I plan to see it again because, now that I've seen it once, I can watch the film again while meditating on what Christ did for us all.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A32RITC3YVWNPH	the_lighthousekeeper	From a truly Christian standpoint, the history of biblical movies has generally not been impressive. Even the best of them, movies like The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur, have not completely been able to shake off a Hollywood feel that suppresses the true spirituality. We're so accustomed to the usual garbage that Hollywood feeds us that when something truly different and better comes along the effect is almost shocking.Movies about the life of Christ in particular have been rather dissapointing. There have been a few credible efforts, but most of them, like The Last Temptation of Christ, have portrayed Jesus as a weak and ineffectual character, completely suppressing the divine in his nature. And anyone watching their portrayal of the Passion would think that crucifixion is no big deal, the way they portray it as so (relatively) painless and dignified.That was the true genius of this movie, to unflinchingly portray the very real suffering of Christ when He died for our sins. Once you have seen this movie there is no hiding from or rationalizing the fact of His agony on the cross. That is why Gibson chose to focus on that one supreme event from the Gospels.It really makes me choke when I hear people deride this film for its violence. A movie like Kill Bill can have people sliced to pieces left and right, and the critics will fall all over themselves rushing to praise it. The Passion depicts violence in a historically accurate manner, for a very serious purpose, and people who defend all manner of disgusting things in film criticize it. People continue to call this film anti-semitic long after all the dire warnings of pogroms in the streets of America have failed to come true. Oh well. The ones who didn't like this movie were mostly the ones who didn't like the book either.Mel Gibson never intended this film to be the blockbuster that it became. It was intended to be an art house flick, that would play in a limited run and probably be very popular on DVD. It was the controversy, ironically enough, that propelled it to such blockbuster status. The hype at times was overdone. As much as I loved this movie, I didn't find it to be a life-changing experience. This movie did have flaws, as every movie does. But it is still a superb and deeply moving religious movie that deserves to still be watched and remembered for generations to come. As I'm sure it will be. The greatest criticism I have of this movie? As many others have said, the book was still better. :)	5.0	Gibson's Courage Brings us a Profound and Moving Vision	2004-10-26	11	7	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	APRZ2IVM8JTLV	The Mysterious Traveler	THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST(2004) Directed by Mel Gibson.Starring James Caviezel and Monica Bellucci.This story of the arrest, show trial, torture and crucifixion of The Christ Jesus has been both overpraised hysterically and unfairly maligned. To say the film is in any way anti-Semitic is to be a lying scoundrel--no different from what the Liberal McCarthy myth is supposed to be a terrifying warning against--but apparently this does not apply to liberal anti Christian bigots who CAN used the supposed methods of McCarthy if they want to.On the other hand, the film is violent and gory---of which this viewer does not approve and believes numbs the audience after awhile. But the film is not nearly as blood soaked as the typical Tarrentino film or many horror films one could mention or even the highly praised gore in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.While the film is mostly well directed and acted with several elements that should interest horror film fans, the basic problem that Gibson does not overcome is that the Life of the Christ has been done definitely by the silent DeMille, KING OF KINGS and the later THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD and JESUS OF NAZARETH. Not to mention THE ROBE, THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII and BEN-HUR. There is very little left new to bring to the table here. The only points of innovation here are that the film is in Aramaic--which is kind of clever and that the film devotes great attention to the suffering of Mary--the Mother of God who has to watch her beloved son die a horrible death. This aspect is very well done and is highly moving.Bottom line?? If you have seen the aforementioned three films then you dont need to see this. It is good but unessential. However one SHOULD probably see it anyway if only to strike a blow against the growing forces of hatred and intolerance that seem to be gaining strength and power in this country and throughout the world.	3.0	See the film the bigots and commissars did not want you to see	2012-05-14	2	1	1

No one has figured out the connection between the Bunny and Easter and Jesus, but this is a God-Squad project...these followers will believe ANYTHING we push at them (and make sure we ask for 15% more tithe in the collection on opening week). (Note for the Hispanic version:  If we pronouce Jesus as ""hezus"", we'll make big bucks from the Latin/South American market and the transplanted Latin/South Americans who lost the property that they stole from the citizens, once their favorite government was overthrown and they had to flee for their lives..but I digress) so Jesus is saved and resurrected by the Easter Bunny, but Jesus is hungry, so miraculously, he produces eggs...hard-boiled eggs --but there is no heat, how did he cook them it's a miracle!!--and they are multi-colored, blessed with multi-hues by God himself!!!  And Jesus gives out baskets..woven straw baskets, there were only three but they miraculously duplicated themselves...he gives out baskets and commands his followers to go out and hunt more multi-colored eggs to feed themselves. His followers are estactic..they make and weave multi-colored hats, or ""bonnets"", to honor Him as they hunt for the ""Easter eggs"".  Of course this is a Mel Gibson film, and while the first film was woefully deficient, the second film will involve a high-speed chase between Jesus and the Devil in pimped-out Porsches thru the LA streets...at night, on the rain-swept streets, like a ""Miami Vice"" thing...with some pumping music by some popular nu-metal band like Linkin Park (but they are so ""yesterday"", we need somebody more exciting) and of course, as with all Mel films, we need explosions explosions EXPLOSIONS big time....and in the end, Jesus gets the girl (Carmen Electra would be good) but he says NO, he has a job to do, the risks are too great (see Spiderman script) and ""we can never be together, I have a Holy Duty to perform"", so he speeds off into the sunset/distance on his skates...that's right, he's a Holy Roller.

If you are a believer in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I hope that you are, you will view this movie as an emotional reminder of the faith that you hold true.  Even if you are not a Christian, you can appreciate the most severe forms of cruelty ever known to man, and learn a lesson from humanity to know that all human life is respectable.  I am not in any position to tell anyone to see, or stay away from this movie...it is entirely a very personal decision that you have to make for yourself.

The torture Jesus endured ripped me to the core of my being, like no previous film about Him ever could. I cannot grasp how the movie could be considered anti-Semitic. The Jews did not kill Christ. They merely condemned him for preaching God's word far differently than they did. The movie tore at my soul, heart, and my very core.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3MSKK5JZYHIUN	Thomas E. Rushton	This movie is destined to join Cecile B DeMille's King of Kings as a grand and wonderfully true portrayal of the gospels.  From my vantage point, the violence was not gratuitous and drove home the point it was supposed to make: that Jesus went through this torture for us, all of us, including those that persecuted him.  The violence is historically accurate as well.  There has been some literary license taken with the roles of Satan, Simon of Cyrene, and the interplay between Pilate and his wife to name a few.  But these only add to the movie and in no way detract from the accruacy from a Biblical standpoint.Is the film anti-semetic? No. All of the gospels 9and the film) pit Jesus the Jew against the religious leaders of the day.  And the film, true to the gospels, make it clear that the religious leaders were not a homogenous group.  This is a struggle of rabbi against rabbi, not Jew versus Christian.Any downside?  Well, you don't get to see the build up to the Passion (Jesus' ministry, miracles, etc.), or the Easter miracle afterwards.  Both of these (especially the resurrection) have made the torture and humiliation of the Christ easier to bear in other film accounts.  The Passion is not the entire story of Jesus, so anyone not knowing the Biblical Jesus would not see the whole picture and may be dissappointed.  But if you know your Bible, you will get much more out of it.This one will go into film history as a truly great film.	5.0	On The Money	2004-02-25	4	0	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A30OXD42ZFYZLO	Thomas Keneally	"Mel Gibson in his fascination for Christ came up with this version of the last few days of Christ. Since I have an interest in all religions (I went to a Catholic school), I wanted to see this to find the portrayal of Christ. It is a combination of anti-semitism and brutality with more than one hour of flogging and taunting by the Romans and the Jews. It did not show any of his great thoughts such as Sermon from the Mount. The most important thought of Jesus of forgiveness and understanding were totally lost. This means that a simplistic, propagandistic account of the events, that involves blaming the Jewish leaders for Christ's death while largely exculpating Pontius Pilate as the representative of Rome, is enshrined in the movie. One reviewer called this movie ""Christploitation"", as America is strongly in the religion spirit and will eat up anything. Using a small budget of $33 million followed by $25 million for marketing, this movie generated a huge profit and makes Gibson one of the most powerful persons in Hollywood. As a profit making strategy, this was outstanding. People like Ismail Merchant who made quality movies with limited budget can learn a thing or two from this approach.Gibson also has ridiculous devils and Satanic apparitions popping up all over the place, whose appearance he has plagiarised from The Omen and Don't Look Now. Is it too much to ask where the spiritual dimension has disappeared to? Where is the message of love, and hope? Where is the compelling poetry of moral grace? Does all of it have to be swept away in a tsunami of fake gore? Gibson offers brief flashbacks to episodes like the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper, hinting in the most superficial way possible at what it has all been about in the first place.For whatever the reason - and it is not hard to guess the true motivating factor here - Gibson has accepted the hateful notion that the Jews and the Jews alone wanted Jesus dead, and that the Romans were somehow hoodwinked into carrying out his execution. To its credit, the Catholic Church itself has gone out of its way in the wake of the Holocaust to declare this loathsome version of events morally anathema. To his discredit, Gibson has chosen to reopen the same old wounds by portraying the Jews as bestial Christ-killers. If you think The Passion Of The Christ is a huge money-maker now, imagine the opening night take in Berlin and Munich had it been filmed 60 or 70 years earlier. The film features a scene where Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest whom the Bible represents as accusing Christ of blasphemy, says that the blood of Jesus should ""be on us and on our children"". The phrase - often referred to as the most inflammatory words in the New Testament - comes from the Gospel of St Matthew and has been commonly deployed by anti-semites through the ages. Gibson had originally made the infamous motto the movie's subtitle, but later removed it as a concession to Jewish interests.Technically speaking, the film is well filmed but monotonous. The violence is so nauseating and repetitive that it is actually a relief when Christ is finally nailed to the cross, as the viewer knows that the ordeal will soon be over, and the nails make a refreshing change from the whips, canes and truncheons. Filmed in the very finest biblical languages, the screenplay is predictably terse, supported by a reliable faux-exotic soundtrack, with roll-the-eyes acting right out of silent films. As Christ the sacred stud, Jim Caviezel doesn't have much to do except say ""Ouch"" in Aramaic. As the Virgin Mary, Maia Morgenstern doesn't have much to do except look depressed. As the assorted Jews, the rest of the cast doesn't have much to do except look evil.It is well-known that Gibson's father Hutton is a Holocaust denier who recently wisecracked that most of the Jews allegedly murdered by the Germans had merely relocated to the Bronx. Gibson film has said that nothing will ever drive a wedge between him and Pops; judging from The Passion Of The Christ, he needn't worry on that score. As Dad might put it: This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased. Any Jew-hater would be. An interesting fact is that in Netflix the people who enjoyed this movie also enjoyed Celcius41.11, Michael Moore hates America, FahrenHYPE 9/11, and The Patriot. Any person who is reasonable at pattern matching should be able to draw conclusions. I am saddened that America has become so drawn to religion and gore that they would swallow such a bad depiction of Jesus. Maybe we Jews are responsible for everything wrong in the world, World Wars, Crusades etc."	1.0	Disappointing version of Christ	2006-02-02	51	24	27

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3KJ6JAZPH382D	"Tim Brough ""author and music buff"""	"I am giving this movie five stars for exactly one reason. After watching it, openly crying at two points, and feeling thoroughly drained as a viewer, ""The Passion Of The Christ"" is not a movie that I will easily forget. It is brutal. It is passionate. It is exquisitely filmed.And yes, it is controversial. But when, in the last few decades, hasn't any film made about Jesus attracted controversy? I mean, even satirical films like ""Dogma"" or ""Monty Python's Life Of Brian"" drew the wrath of those who puff up like piranhas should that which they consider sacred get as much as finger pointed in a direction other than how it was mentioned in ""their"" Bible. Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" brought out so many red meat protesters that I crossed a line of sign carrying fanatics when I went to see it in 1988.There were no protesters at the theater I went to see ""The Passion"" at. After the movie ended, I had to sit in my seat for a few minutes and let the tears stop. I felt awful and cleansed at the same time. You can't see this movie without remembering that (even to the not so religiously inclined) the story of God's plan for his son was to accept the burden of the sins of the world, and die with their weight on his soul.I know there are more than a few who now debate Mel Gibson's overt and subliminal motivations behind ""The Passion's"" strongest and most controversial scenes. As far as anti-Semitism, I didn't see it. What I did see was an angry mob whipped into a frenzy by men of power willing to lie to get what they wanted. A quote from Charles Baudelaire kept coming to my mind during that whole courtyard scene: ""It must not be supposed that the Devil tempts only men of genius. He doubtless despises imbeciles, but he does not disdain their support. Quite on the contrary, he founds his greatest hope upon such people."" (It was only later that I thought of a certain litany from a few of our own public officials concerning Weapons of Mass Destruction.)I must also admit, if their were any Romans alive today, they'd have a case. The soldiers are, for the most part, depicted as drooling sadistic goons who relish the fact that they are ripping the skin right off a man's back. They discuss with cold calculation how to nail a man to the cross. Only towards the end do any of them give any indication that something may be seriously amiss with the death of this one man.And there is no lack of sadism here. If you thought ""Kill Bill Vol. One"" was a mindless bloodfest, then you really should stay away from ""The Passion Of The Christ."" Mel Gibson makes Tarantino look like a model of restraint here (but if that surprises you, reflect back to the disembowelment scene in ""Braveheart""). The amount of time spent on the scourging of Jesus and the slow motion splatter of running blood and skin is overwhelming, but then again, isn't that the point? Jesus suffered for the sins of the world. We just have never been subject to actually seeing it this way on screen before. And yes, I did wonder if it was absolutely necessary to spend almost a third of the movie fixated on the torture of a man.What kept me riveted was what I ultimately feel was ""The Passion's"" underlying main message after good Vs evil. That would be the love of a mother towards her son. The Mary of the film keeps coming back to her son, and with it we see the pain in her eyes as she watches, all too well understanding, what her son is doing. But we also see her in the flashbacks to life with the son she raised. When James Caviezel, who made a stunningly empathic Jesus, tells her ""Mother, I make all things new,"" it is a pivotal moment. For the detractors who say that the film is hollow, they obviously are missing that important subtext.I'd strongly suggest seeing ""The Passion Of The Christ"" with somebody else as a support person. I'd also state that weak stomachs or hearts should stay at home, and small children should NOT be in on this one. If you do not want to spend the money on this movie due to your beliefs, probably all the better for you, but spare me your comments and negative votes if you've not seen the film. Like it or not, Mel Gibson has now proven himself to be a master film maker with ""The Passion Of The Christ."""	5.0	You will not leave the theater without an opinion.	2004-03-12	8	5	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AEYEAH3C78BBZ	Tim Challies	"As many reviews have focused on the quality of this movie as a film, I am going to examine the content of the movie as it pertains to Protestant beliefs.MariolatryNaturally when I heard that this movie was being made by a devout Catholic I became concerned with his portrayal of Mary. It seems my fears were well-founded. In the Biblical accounts Mary appears only in the book of John where Jesus tells John that Mary is now to be his mother and tells Mary that John is now to be her son. In this movie she is present in almost every scene and her role is elevated far above what the Bible teaches. She is presented as being Jesus' support and strength during His trials. Many times Jesus falls and is unable to get up, but after looking at His mother He finds the strength to carry on. The disciples all call Mary ""mother."" Mary is shown submitting her will to God's, saying ""so be it"" as if her consent was necessary. The movie shows Mary as the suffering servant, suffering along with Jesus. This, of course, stems from Gibson's Catholic theology and is foreign to the Bible.Emphasis on Jesus' SufferingThe movie chronicles Jesus' physical suffering. He is beaten time and time again and each beating is shown with graphic brutality. After two hours of suffering we see only ten or twelve seconds of Jesus' triumphing over death. There is really no attempt made to humanize Jesus or to display His divinity and power. There is no attempt made to explain that His physical suffering was nothing when compared to the suffering He experienced by being forsaken by God as the full wrath of God for sin was poured out upon Him. One would assume from the movie that the pain He felt was one and the same as His forsakenness.Would this movie look the same if it was made by a Protestant?The answer to this question is unequivocally ""no!"" The movie espouses Catholic theology, Mariology and interpretation. It is clear this movie has a strong Catholic bias. The Catholic bias is simply too strong to deny or downplay.ContextThis movie is almost completely free from context. Any serious student of the Bible knows that context is king and studying the Bible outside of its context is dangerous and leads to erroneous beliefs. Though flashbacks provide snippets of context, on the whole this movie shows only the events of the suffering of Jesus. Without context these events can make no sense to people who are not familiar with Jesus' history. There is no explanation as to why He has to suffer or even what His suffering and death accomplishes.Idolatry?I found it very troublesome that people identify Jim the actor with Jesus. My mind and emotions never made the transition to actually believing that Jim was Jesus. At one time I began to feel emotion as Jesus, nailed to the cross, cried out for God to forgive His murderers. Interestingly, my mind immediately intervened and kept me from seeing Jim as Jesus. I simply could not and ultimately did not want to see the real Jesus in this movie. I could not identify with this human playing my Lord and my Savior. My mind told me that making such a leap would be to succumb to idolatry.The ScriptOn a macro level this movie succeeds in presenting the story of Jesus' arrest, trial and death. It covers all the major points from the Garden of Gethsemane to Jesus' death. On a micro level it is a terrible failure. Errors on this level abound and erroneous theology and interpretation is evident in almost every scene. On the macro level it is the gospel, for it simply follows the Biblical outline. On the micro level it is not the Bible and thus not Christianity. The micro level is mysticism, tradition and poor interpretation.Gibson drew heavily from Sister Anne Emmerich's devotional book entitled The Dolorous Passion of Christ. Emmerich is known as being a Mystic, Stigmatist, Visionary, and Prophet. She apparently received many visions in which God provided her details about Jesus' last days that are not contained in the Bible. This extra-Biblical account of Jesus' suffering provided many of the smaller details in the movie such as Pilate's wife providing the cloth to Mary as well as Simon and Jesus linking arms as they held the cross. It also provided inspiration for some of the words Peter spoke, such as his expression of unworthiness before Mary. Most troubling is that it provided many of the words Jesus spoke. A great number of Jesus' words from the movie are drawn not from the Bible but from Emmerich. The movie makes no attempt to show what was drawn directly from the Bible and what was drawn from extra-Biblical writing. I am reminded of Revelation 22:18 which reads ""I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book."" To add to the Words of the Bible is a grave sin.Reading through The Dolorous Passion of Christ after seeing the movie I was shocked by how closely the script of The Passion of the Christ follows this book. So much of what I assumed was artistic license was actually drawn from supposed extra-Biblical revelation.ConclusionsI found this movie to be very disappointing and disheartening. Though I had read many reviews for and against it, I was convinced when I began to watch that I would be pleasantly surprised. I believed this especially based on the multitudes of Protestant leaders who provided their support for the movie. The list of these men (on one of the Passion Web sites) reads like a who's who of Christian leaders and they described the movie as being ""factually accurate,"" ""very accurate [in the details],"" ""realistic,"" ""biblical,"" ""an accurate account,"" ""a true representation of Jesus"" and ""close to the Scriptures."" Alas, it was not to be. Error is abundant to such a degree that I was shocked that so many Protestant pastors and theologians could give it their full, unequivocal approval. How little they must think of Protestant theology to ignore the pervasive Roman Catholic influence in this movie. My greatest disappointment was not in the movie but in the Protestant leaders and theologians who gave it their recommendation. Gibson made a movie that expresses his faith, but his faith is not the Protestant faith. It seems that so many people in the Protestant world simply do not know enough to discern the difference or they just do not care.It sickens me to hear people expressing that this movie brings the gospels to life and expresses the story of Jesus' suffering in a new and relevant way. I only wish that people would be so enthusiastic about the Bible! God has ordained that the primary means of reaching the world would be through the faithful preaching of His Word. That is not to say that He cannot and will not use other means, but we must guard ourselves against believing that other methods can surpass the Bible. This movie, full of flaws and error, has made me realize even more why God has given us His living, breathing Word as the primary means of reaching the world. Oh how I wish the church would turn to the Bible as they have turned to this movie! How I wish we would feel the same level of excitement for God's words to us given in the Scripture. How I wish we would have faith to believe that God can do so much more through the Bible than can ever be done through a movie.I will leave you with this thought: As my wife left the theatre last night she heard a member of a Protestant church say ""I didn't remember the part in the Bible where Mary wipes up Jesus' blood. That was so beautiful."" This movie blurs Catholicism and Protestantism, Bible and Tradition, Scripture and mysticism. This movie is firmly opposed to Biblical Protestantism."	1.0	Opposed To Protestantism	2004-10-18	84	40	44
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3PHHTXVI7KKRI	"Time2Read ""Time2Read"""	"Yes, The Passion DID have scenes of cruel brutality, all of which were directed to Christ.....but those scenes, anguishing as they were, paled in comparrison to the awesome OVERWHELMING LOVE that Christ distinctly exuded on the screen. James Caviezel was 100% believable. All the actors/actresses were for that matter.  The movie was so incredibly well done...brilliantly done, in fact, that it made the historical account of the life of Christ step into the 21st century!  It all seemed real, as if you were really there....  Not only was the LOVE that Christ revealed radiating off the screen, but also the love that Mary had for her son...she was a Mom..... a real Mom....as only a another mother can understand.  While watching the movie I was reminded how fortunate I am to have that wonderful, priceless treasure of loving a child and to be loved by that child.  Mary was thoroughly awesome...every mother in the world could relate to her.The Passion was marvelous....I hope Mr. Gibson does a sequel.Now some Q & A time:*Would I take a young child to see The Passion?  NO*Would I take my 83 year old mother who has never seena ""violent movie"" in her lifetime?  YES....she's going tomorrow.* Does The Passion have world-wide appeal?

Yes,  I have a weak stomach and have no room in my life for being entertained by watching violent films/TV shows. I sat on an aisle seat near the back of the theatre just in case I had to get up quick and run out....didn't have to...... the LOVE and peace that Christ portrayed was truly THE overwhelming, awesome feeling that filled the theater...It was completely unexpected.*Was it Anti-Semetic?

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2N3YAM4K3ATM	-_Tim_-	"""But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed for our inequities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.""- Isaiah 53:5This disturbing movie explores two themes.  The first theme is introduced by the quotation from Isaiah, above, which opens the movie.  As Reinhold Niebuhr has emphasized, God's love is suffering love.  Rather than destroy evil, God takes evil upon himself.  Because of the magnitude of evil in the world, Jesus' suffering had to be immense.  This suffering is the main focus of the Passion of the Christ, and the violence and malice directed at Jesus reach almost unimaginable proportions.The second theme is a struggle between supernatural forces.  Director Mel Gibson believes that Satan is real, and he has spoken of himself in the past, when he was separated from God, as a ""monster.""  Thus, Jesus' suffering is seen as a struggle between Satan and his forces, on one hand, and God and Jesus, on the other.The movie emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal man.  The night before his crucifixion, on the Mount of Olives, he is afraid, and we observe his life as a man - not an ordinary man, but a man, nonetheless - through many flashbacks of him working as a carpenter, exchanging tenderness with his mother, interceding to save the life of an adulteress, and preaching the gospel.In the last scene, we witness Christ's resurrection, which Gibson presents as a physical event.  In Christ's face, we see his appreciation of what he has accomplished through his suffering on the cross.  While he still has the form of the man, it is an idealized form.  He still bears the wounds of his crucifixion, but they have been transformed and cleaned.Some have seen indications of anti-Semitism in this movie; I saw none.  The Pharisees bring Jesus before the civil authorities but he suffers most directly at the hands of Roman soldiers.  I would also say that the Romans were portrayed as being more depraved and uncivilized than the Jews."	3.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-10-15	7	7	0

The whipping scene alone is perhaps the most violent scene ever filmed.  The effects were realistic in this and it is gruesome.  I will also state that I'm a Secular Humanist and while I believe the &#34;man&#34; Jesus Christ existed, I'm not convinced he did all the things the Bible says he did.  While I feel that Gibson was trying to give as accurate an adaptation as possible, I felt some of it was a bit hard to follow and in some parts it was about the movie making experience.  Some of it was over-the-top scenes of implausibility, and greatly unrealistic.  I am glad that I watched it, but don't care to see it again.	3.0	Too much?	2012-12-05	2	1	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2GJ98824GGXGP	Timothy Kearney	"Without question, the film THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST has created quiet a stir. Some are quick to defend the film, believing it is almost a sign from God. Others have been rather quick to discredit the film, calling it anti-Semitic, overtly violent, and nothing more than a work a religious propaganda. Of course, many of the film's supporters and opponents have not seen it, but that's another story.Perhaps because of the media attention, I was determined not to see the film, deciding I was already a believer and my faith was strong, one movie would not change what I already believe. I only decided to see the film because people were asking me questions about the film, usually about scenes not found in the Bible. I could not answer them, so I decided to see what the movie.Contrary to what many critics say, Gibson does follow the basic story lines of the gospels. He also adds material from medieval passion plays which do not distort the story. He adds some materials from a visionary, and many of these details give the movie a somewhat creepy feeling. Poetic license, maybe, but does it detract? No. Basically Gibson, as a person of faith, presents his version of the story of Christ's last hours. In this regard he's no different from Cecil B. De Mille who added material to the Exodus account for THE TEN COMMANDMENTS or Franco Zefferelli who also took liberties with JESUS OF NAZARETH. Both of these works are considered classics, and both inspire faith and we don't seem to mind that neither is completely accurate, so why the uproar with the Gibson film?From the point of view of cinematography, the film has many excellent features. We get a sense of place throughout the film. Light is used effectively and throughout the film there is a mood that Gibson creates that tells us something is happening. I will be interesting to see if it is nominated for any Academy awards. The film making certainly merits it.Now, as far as the criticisms leveled against the film. Are they accurate? Is the film a piece of religious propaganda? I suppose this depends on point of view. If I took someone who is not a believer to the film, that person might be inclined to say yes, but for many people, the film can help a person come to a deeper understanding of Christ's last hours. Is the film violent? Yes, but there are far more violent films that have been released. Perhaps these are not religious films, but we have to keep in mind, a crucifixion is not a cake walk. The Romans soldiers had little in common with Rebecca of Sunny Brook Farm. Let's be realistic here. We also have to remember it is an ""R"" rated film, and with good reason. It's not kid fare. Should it include the entire life of Jesus? Well, we don't object when a film only tells of Jesus' birth, or his miracles, or his teachings. So why should we object to a film just about the Passion? Is it offensive to Jewish people? Here is where I did have some objections to the film. Gibson does not do as good enough job separating the religious leaders who opposed Jesus (scripture tells us not all leaders opposed him; Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were both Pharisees and religious leaders) from the average Jewish person. Judas is presented as a bit too overtly money grubbing. Intelligent people would not come away from this film with anti-Jewish feelings, but in the hands of an anti-Semite, there could be some fuel for hatred."	4.0	Perhaps the Years Most Controversial Film	2004-03-12	4	3	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3I2GBE2KGQV1U	"Timothy Linsley ""Tim Linsley"""	How does one address a movie like The Passion...?  So much controversy, so much blood, so much potential to both inspire and offend, yet which has become the highest grossing R-rated movie in history...  To discuss a movie such as this is to attempt to walk across hot coals without getting burned.I've always loved an intellectual challenge.The Passion of the Christ is Mel Gibson's love letter to Jesus, taking the familiar Biblical tale and spelling out everything that was previously just a vague statement.  Many have criticized it for it's violence, saying that it was a movie Mel made only for himself.  They seem to forget that the best art was made only for the artist.  And, considering this was made for The Artist, that sets it up to an even higher standard.And, on whatever level you see it, it's quite a piece of filmmaking.Gibson certainly knows how to make a wonderfully detailed, dramatic historical film, no matter what your faith, and knows how to draw out the tension in every moment.  Every craftsman, from composer John Debney to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, is at the top of their game, and Gibson's use of slow-motion makes sure you feel the wieght of every blow.  Whether the film as a whole is lacking in dramatic weight depends entirely on how well you understand the story behind the story.The Biblical crucifiction is more than simply a man being beaten and killed.  It is God fulfilling a mission, while facing direct opposition from all evil.  An early subtitle explains that Jesus' mission was to die for all mankind, bearing the punishment for the sins of all.  No easy task.  The point is driven home by Satan, envisioned by Gibson as a strangely appealing, albino, androgynous type.  Indeed, Satan is onhand throughout the movie, every time that it gets to be difficult.  Jesus' mother, Mary, even asks when He will choose to be delivered.  That's the point of the movie: will He give in?  Will it be so bad that He will turn His back on His mission?  The death isn't the end:  it's a tragic victory.(...)Again, that all depends on what you take in.(...)Those who truly understand the depth of the movie, though, may be inspired to hug the next Jewish person they see.I'm not saying that there isn't evidence there.  Caiaphus is indeed portrayed as a tooth-gnashing villain type.  (For that reason, and that reason alone, I deduct half a star.)  But many more Jews stand by Jesus' side when He needs them most.  There is no blanket Jew-bashing going on here.  Simply Sanhidren bashing.Is it a life-changing experience?  Well, I can't speak for everyone, but it most definitely worked in me.  Either way, love it or hate it, you'll be talking about it for a long tim after you leave the theater.And that's what a great movie is supposed to do.	5.0	Great Christian Film:  No Longer an Oxymoron	2004-04-15	6	5	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1LZVU5SRRM3VX	Timothy Michael Resh	"Seldom does a large audience leave a movie theater in complete silence, but that is precisely what happened during the matinee showing of Gibson's Passion that my wife and I attended. Many left the theater visibly shaken, others in tears. I have not seen any other film have quite the effect on an audience that this one did. My wife and I did not speak a word until we were in the car for at least five minutes.I have seen many of the other ""Passion"" stories, everything from Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" to Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" and while all of these have their individual merits, Gibson's Passion succeeds where the others don't always get it right. As viscerally wrenching as the film is, Gibson succeeds in capturing the key element that the others overlook: power.Gibson's ""Passion Play"" could just as easily be called the ""Power Play,"" because when you reduce the story to its key thematic elements, the crucifixion and death of Christ are about the complex power structure that Jesus threatened. Jesus, the son of a carpenter, threatened the religious power of the Pharisees over the Jewish people. He threatened the power of Pilate to keep the Jewish population in line. Herod, when Jesus is brought before him, however, is short-sighted enough to believe that, because Jesus does not perform a miracle on demand for him, Jesus has no power over him. Herod, of course, further ridicules Jesus and sends him back to Pilate.The thematic element of power undergirds all others in the film, and could be summed up in one of the lines of dialogue (roughly approximated here) that is taken from the gospel of John. Before he is sentenced to crucifixion, Jesus says to Pilate: ""You have no power over me except what is given from above."" Therein lies the reminder that, although the earthly powers that be have beaten Jesus to a bloody pulp, mocked him, tormented him, and killed him in perhaps the most painful way possible, they truly have no power over him.As for the pre-release charges of anti-semitism, I am unconvinced that the film is anti-semitic. If this film is anti-semitic, then so is the entire New Testament. Although Caiaphas and some of the high priests are ultimately depicted as forcing Pilate's hand in crucifying Christ, there are notable dissenting voices among the high priests who feel that the charges against Christ are ridiculous. These high priests are quickly silenced and shoved out of the way by the high priest. I found the depictions of the Pharisees to be less favorable in Lloyd Webber's musical than in this film, and with the passage of time, the controversies over ""Superstar"" have died down considerably. I expect that the same will occur with this film.More disturbing than the singular hatred Caiaphas and other members of the Pharisees display toward Jesus is the merry brutality of the Romans, the group that comes off most poorly in the film. The centurions who carry out the graphic and bloody scourging of Christ are not just following orders--they visibly enjoy the torment they are inflicting. They believe they hold the ultimate power over Christ's physical body, and beat and ridicule him mercilessly, baring their awful teeth in sneers of derision from the courtyard where Christ is scourged all the way to Golgotha. If anyone is to be reviled, it is the Roman centurions.Another theme that Gibson captures so well in the film is the battle raging between the larger powers of good and evil. A pale, androgynous creature that we can only assume to be Satan appears throughout the film, reminding us that although this drama is the passion of the Christian God incarnate in a man, there is much more at stake than the petty power play on earth--the forces of good and evil have thrown down the gauntlet in Jerusalem.Gibson also acknowledges the fact that the crucifixion isn't the end of the story of Christ. Where Lloyd Webber's musical stops at the cross, Gibson's continues, albeit briefly, to the resurrection. Not that anyone can really give ""spoilers"" to one of the best-known plot lines of all time, but without giving too much away, let me just say that Gibson recognizes that the ultimate power play happens after the death of Jesus. Although he gives it somewhat short shrift in the closing moments of the film, we get a hint of the joy that is the Christian Easter holiday after getting hit with two hours of the brutal pain that is Good Friday in the Christian tradition.An ecumenical masterpiece, Gibson's work will be remembered by Christians long after the petty controversies have died down as a graphic reminder of Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection for the sins of the world. While the movie is certainly too intense for anyone younger than teenagers, it is a brutally accurate and moving experience for adults of any faith. The acting is magnificent, and the cinematography and score will move even the hardest of hearts.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A175O40GGGJNA	"Timothy Robinson ""timrobinson"""	It amazes me to see how some people in this world can be so stubborn and ignorant that they put so much focus on looking for if Jews are being blamed for Jesus' death and put less focus on what the ultimate goal was behind Jesus' death (one individual in particular is Jamie Bernard in NY Daily News, try to read her review online sometime.)  Coming out of this movie, my faith was more intensified by what was probably the most graphic and yet closely accurate depiction of Jesus' last 12 hours on earth.  But the real deal I want to get to is the fact that it was not Jews that put Jesus to the cross nor was it the Roman soldiers, it was humanity.  Our sins and our disobedience to God is what did it.  People can say that based on this interpretation, Jesus' own people sentenced him to be crucified or that the Romans were made to be like drunk lunatics.  But I see it as a showcase of how deep our sin, as one race, got and it needed someone of the stature of Jesus Christ to go through this torture and death to be purged of that.  THAT's what this was about.  It was a message of sacrifice and a message of love, something that was even told well through flashbacks to the Passover dinner and the sermon on the Mount.The acting was good and each role filled out just wonderful.  James Caviezel played the Jesus character unbelievably well, showing the Son of God as human as he can be through his fears of what's to come but yet the courage to fulfill the will of God for the sake of his people.  Mary Magdalene was done well too and I couldn't help but feel what she was feeling when the whipping began.  And the actress for Satan was just plain freaky.  Satan never really talked much but you always felt Satan's presence throughout each key point in the movie.  I personally thought the scene with Judas' betrayal and death was done very good with the kids tugging and tugging him during his guilt trip.  Overall here, the acting was good enough in that everyone was showing their anguish over what was being done.Now for the gory parts: I personally felt it wasn't that gory.  I'm not trying to put down the suffering Jesus went through because God knows I would not want to go through that at all.  But there are hundreds of horror and suspense flicks out there that just pour buckets of blood that I would not recommend to the weak of heart and this one would not be on that same level with those flicks in terms of spilt blood.  BUT it was graphic in the sense that Mel Gibson made every whipping and each nail that pierced Jesus' flesh look real, nothing watered down, like you actually felt the pain (I really cringed on that one whip shot that you most likely know of).  So it was more of a psychological sense of intense violence in that it was bloody and it felt real.A couple of weaknesses I could point out would be explaining a couple of scenes to the non-believers.  I'm not sure they'll understand why Satan was carrying a disfigured baby during the whipping (I still don't understand that part either) or why Satan was screaming from the depths of hell.  It's not an entirely big deal but it would help to flesh out why this is occurring, even for a few more seconds but I know Mel wouldn't want to go off on tangents.Overall, this is something that needs to be seen, whether you're Christian or not.  I think if you can open your heart to this message that this could be a life-changing experience for the non-believer and a faith-strengthening experience for the believer.  Put aside the controversies you've heard of this being spiteful towards Jews and realize what WE as human beings have done to Him.  WE persecuted Him and WE nailed him to the cross.  This movie is about what one man went through to save us from sin and is a demonstration of the depth of God's awesome and abundant love for us, that He is willing to part away of His own Son, to have him suffer so much because of the depths of our sin, to release us from that very sin.  Keep that in mind when you're ready to give the movie a fair shot.	5.0	Passion--THE most powerful event	2004-03-27	2	1	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2OWX05KNWKSH0	Tina Gulotta	What an amazing movie.  I have some thoughts about the Jewish opinions that have surfaced against the movie.  Jews have always been protrayed (2000 years of persecution) as  victims throughout history and having to see themselves as the aggressor may be too psychologically difficult for them as a people.  The Romans were more sadistic toward Jesus in this film than any other group of people.  With this said, I don't think people are looking to blame a sect or people for the murder of Jesus.  Most people seeing this movie are experiencing this film on a very different level.  A level of sprituality and compassion; not hatred or violence.  This portrayal of Jesus was of a man that was non-violent and sacrificial in life.  Mel Gibson showed us the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus made to mankind through this beautiful film.  I did not focus on the blame game that has been spinning for months.  Mel Gibson has made a magnificent movie and will probably be nominated for an oscar, along with the very much deserving Jim Caviezel.	5.0	Gibson & Caviezel	2004-03-06	2	1	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ANKQGTXHREOI5	Titanium Lili	"It takes a lot of gall to say that this movie is almost straight out of the Bible, as there are MANY places that are grossly exaggerated.  The flogging scene was one such place, where the number of strokes received was simply absurd compared with what is actually in the Bible and what a body can withstand without blacking out.Additionally, the directorial choices left much to be desired, making the scene where Jesus carries the cross last about 3 or 4 times as long as it needed to have in relation to the rest of the film.  I found myself saying to the screen more than once during that time, ""Will you just get there already??""  It was like watching Frodo with the number of times he fell down in a single scene.I also don't understand why the director chose to ignore well-documented historical facts such as that crucifixion was done through the wrists and not the hands, as the hands would not be able to support the weight of the body when nailed the way Jesus is depicted in this movie.I also found it odd that even though the director was supposedly going for accuracy, the crucified men were not naked, as historically was done by the Romans.  Apparently it's okay to watch violence on one's deity but not nudity of that deity for whatever bizarre reason?My summary:This is a poorly directed snuff film with little regard for historical accuracy; but since it's a religious film, it is zealously defended by those who don't care to actually THINK about it."	1.0	Snuff flick for Christians	2004-10-12	81	39	42
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ABKDVUJXBA1SZ	Titus	"I saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" and I think it is one of the most powerful films ever made. The use of the visions of the Catholic mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich only add to the account written down in the Gospels. If you go in to watch with an open mind and leave whatever agenda you have, pro or con, at the door then you are in for the experience of a lifetime.As for all the hand-wringing over the violence of the film most of that criticism comes from the arch-hypocrites of academia and the movie industry who managed to sit through ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Friday the 13th part MMMCCCCLLL"" without batting an eyelash. But suddenly when it comes to ""The Passion"" they're all a bunch of shrinking violets.Also, I do not think the film is anti-semitic any more than ""Training Day"" is anti-black. Are there Jewish villains in the story, yes. Are there Jewish heros in the story, also yes. If any group comes out of the film with a black eye it's the Romans. The fact is that Christ's story is fundamentally a Jewish story ergo most of the major characters, for good or ill, are going to be Jewish.Having said all that I believe ""The Passion"" is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It shows us in unapologetic yet artistic images the depths of the suffering and degradation that Christ endured for our salvation.

It is strictly from the biblical account but where the scriptures are silent, Gibson's imagination adds to the experience as it literally brings the viewer to the Garden of Gethsemane and walks us through passion of Jesus Christ. Using biblical languages adds to that experience all the more that even if we dont understand the language, we can still follow the story. We can see the close bond between Jesus and his mother, the struggle of faith of his apostles and we can even sense why it is many were opposed to the Christ. There is love and hatred, fear and faith and we are left an emotional wreck trying to contemplate this great mystery of faith.	5.0	the best movie ever	2013-06-16	2	2	0

In my humble opinion, there was nothing controversial about it at all.  For the most part, this is a film for believers.  While there might be non-christians who appreciate the film in an artistic sense, for the most part it is a film that will appeal primarily to christians.  It seems to me that everyone who decried the film as numbingly violent and anti-semitic just plain old miss the point...Gibson's aim was to make Christ's suffering more real, and visceral.  While the gospels of Matthew and Mark are pretty specific as to the details of Christ's crucifixion, actually ""witnessing"" it as Gibson's film allows us to do, gives one a greater appreciation for what he endured.  That is the whole point of the film...to give you an eyewitness point-of-view.  Contrary to many critics' assertions, the film matched up pretty well with my Bible.  Gibson does take some artistic license, but not much...He does not deviate too far from Biblical accounts.  Although it is difficult to watch, it is beautifully shot, and the original score perfectly complements the film and its message.  Jim Caviezel, in particular, delivers a stunningly emotional performance in spite of sparse dialogue.  In the end, it isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ACFK06NL9N7I8	"""tnjresh"""	"Seldom does a large audience leave a movie theater in complete silence, but that is precisely what happened during the matinee showing of Gibson's Passion that my wife and I attended.  Many left the theater visibly shaken, others in tears.  I have not seen any other film have quite the effect on an audience that this one did.  My wife and I did not speak a word until we were in the car for at least five minutes.I have seen many of the other ""Passion"" stories, everything from Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" to Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" and while all of these have their individual merits, Gibson's Passion succeeds where the others don't always get it right.  As viscerally wrenching as the film is, Gibson succeeds in capturing the key element that the others overlook: power.Gibson's ""Passion Play"" could just as easily be called the ""Power Play,"" because when you reduce the story to its key thematic elements, the crucifixion and death of Christ are about the complex power structure that Jesus threatened.  Jesus, the son of a carpenter, threatened the religious power of the Pharisees over the Jewish people.  He threatened the power of Pilate to keep the Jewish population in line.  Herod, when Jesus is brought before him, however, is short-sighted enough to believe that, because Jesus does not perform a miracle on demand for him, Jesus has no power over him.  Herod, of course, further ridicules Jesus and sends him back to Pilate.The thematic element of power undergirds all others in the film, and could be summed up in one of the lines of dialogue (roughly approximated here) that is taken from the gospel of John.  Before he is sentenced to crucifixion, Jesus says to Pilate: ""You have no power over me except what is given from above.""  Therein lies the reminder that, although the earthly powers that be have beaten Jesus to a bloody pulp, mocked him, tormented him, and killed him in perhaps the most painful way possible, they truly have no power over him.As for the pre-release charges of anti-semitism, I am unconvinced that the film is anti-semitic.  If this film is anti-semitic, then so is the entire New Testament.  Although Caiaphas and some of the high priests are ultimately depicted as forcing Pilate's hand in crucifying Christ, there are notable dissenting voices among the high priests who feel that the charges against Christ are ridiculous. These high priests are quickly silenced and shoved out of the way by the high priest.  I found the depictions of the Pharisees to be less favorable in Lloyd Webber's musical than in this film, and with the passage of time, the controversies over ""Superstar"" have died down considerably.  I expect that the same will occur with this film.More disturbing than the singular hatred Caiaphas and other members of the Pharisees display toward Jesus is the merry brutality of the Romans, the group that comes off most poorly in the film.  The centurions who carry out the graphic and bloody scourging of Christ are not just following orders--they visibly enjoy the torment they are inflicting.  They believe they hold the ultimate power over Christ's physical body, and beat and ridicule him mercilessly, baring their awful teeth in sneers of derision from the courtyard where Christ is scourged all the way to Golgotha.  If anyone is to be reviled, it is the Roman centurions.Another theme that Gibson captures so well in the film is the battle raging between the larger powers of good and evil.  A pale, androgynous creature that we can only assume to be Satan appears throughout the film, reminding us that although this drama is the passion of the Christian God incarnate in a man, there is much more at stake than the petty power play on earth--the forces of good and evil have thrown down the gauntlet in Jerusalem.Gibson also acknowledges the fact that the crucifixion isn't the end of the story of Christ.  Where Lloyd Webber's musical stops at the cross, Gibson's continues, albeit briefly, to the resurrection.  Not that anyone can really give ""spoilers"" to one of the best-known plot lines of all time, but without giving too much away, let me just say that Gibson recognizes that the ultimate power play happens after the death of Jesus.  Although he gives it somewhat short shrift in the closing moments of the film, we get a hint of the joy that is the Christian Easter holiday after getting hit with two hours of the brutal pain that is Good Friday in the Christian tradition.An ecumenical masterpiece, Gibson's work will be remembered by Christians long after the petty controversies have died down as a graphic reminder of Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection for the sins of the world.  While the movie is certainly too intense for anyone younger than teenagers, it is a brutally accurate and moving experience for adults of any faith.  The acting is magnificent, and the cinematography and score will move even the hardest of hearts.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2Q13PHEXGR48Q	T O'Brien	The Passion of the Christ is a film that caused tons of controversy before it was even released, but when it comes right down to it, it is just a good movie.  The Passion follows the last hours of Jesus' life from him being arrested to his trial all the way through his punishment and crucifixion.  Director Mel Gibson wanted to make a movie that realistically showed what Jesus went through in his final hours, and he definitely accomplished what he set out to do.  Passion is pretty accurate in telling the story of Jesus' crucifixion although not much background is given to the story.  Much of the controversy was caused by cries of anti-Semitism, which I disagree with, and the extreme levels of violence.  This is a very graphic movie from beginning to end.  What sets it apart from most movie violence is that it is all realistic.  The movie follows the Roman soldiers scourging Jesus as well as a horrific crucifixion scene.  All of these scenes are hard to watch, and I think that is what Gibson wanted to do when he made this movie.  His goal was to show what horrible things Jesus Christ went through in his last hours, and I don't think he could have made it any more believable.Judging the movie as a film is much easier than examining the controversy behind it.  This is a beautifully shot movie with incredible cinematography from Caleb Deschanel.  Passion brings you into ancient Jerusalem at the time of Jesus' life.  Equally as good is the score by composer John Debney.  Debney turns in an excellent middle eastern/arabic theme soundtrack that is perfect for the movie.  It is very moving, but it does not overpower the rest of the movie.James Caviezel is incredible as Jesus.  Unlike previous actors who have played Jesus, Caviezel actually looks somewhat like what Jesus would have looked like, or at least more so than Max van Sydow.  The whole movie is spoken in ancient Aramaic and Latin with Caviezel leading the way.  He gives an incredible performance.  Monica Belluci and Maia Morgenstern are excellent as Mary Magdalen and Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Some of the more notable supporting cast includes Hristo Jivkov as the apostle John, Mattia Sbragia as the high pries Caiphas, Francesco de Vito as the apostle Peter, Hristo Shopov as Pontius Pilate, Fabio Sartor as the Roman centurion Abenader, and Rosalinda Celentano as Satan.  The DVD offers a beautiful looking widescreen presentation, but no other extras.  I understand why Gibson chose not to put any extras on the DVD, but it would have been interesting to see a making of documentary or something along those lines.

Its Truth is borne out by the degree to which it is hated - like Christ was.It is a medieval view of Jesus' Passion that Mel Gibson gives us.  Gibson, a product of the Medieval Tridentine Mass, is the only man who could do it.As Rev. Carter Heyward, Professor of Theology, Episcopal Divinity School said, ""[The] movie illuminates a medieval, not biblical, interpretation that it is the blood of Christ that saves humankind. Not Jesus' life, not his healings or his wisdom, not his teaching or his compassion, not his passion for justice, but rather his death on the cross is what saves humankind; and moreover, his death on the cross as willed by his Father God, who requires him to suffer this excruciating death as payment for the sins of the world.""As a Protestant steeped all-too-often in the divinity of Christ - I loved the Catholic focus on the humanity of Christ - his blood, sweat, and tears.  I loved the depiction of Pilate.  Mary was wonderful. Satan was amazing.  I could never have imagined such a Satan - and now I cannot get its image out of my mindMel Gibson is a genius.

Bottom-line:  The movie is powerful because it is a dramatic presentation of the final hours of Jesus' life, from the Garden to the Grave.  Viewers are invited to see how it really might have happened, even hearing the words as they were actually spoken (with English subtitles, that proved effortless to follow).  Jesus suffered and agonized in a very human, yet Spirit-empowered manner.  Mary was both strong and broken...what incredible suffering!  Romans and Jews came across realistically--some hardened and cruel, others questioning and troubled.  Christians will rediscover the gravitas of Christ's sacrifice, and the depth of God's love.  Seekers will either be drawn or repulsed, depending on whether they ultimately accept the truth of this most troubling story.  Enemies and opponents of the Christian faith will do as they have...disect hints of unfairness, obsessiveness, or exclusiveness in this telling of the gospel story.  After all, to those who do not believe, the Cross and its story are an offense, even according to the Bible.What the Passion is not:  1.  The Anti-Semitism charge is absurd.  Jesus calls on the Father to forgive the sins of those present.  He is shown fighting Satan, more than he is the Sanhedrin.  Christians Scripture declare that we (and Jesus) battle spirits and principalities, not flesh and blood.  Gibson cleverly included this aspect, by introducing demons and the Devil into the plot. 2.  Gratutiously violent.  Yes, the scourging is brutal, as are the baring of the cross to Calvary, and the crufixion itself.  However, the violence is real and natural, not the silly stuff one sees in horror and generically violent movies.The Passion of the Christ garners five stars for an original, passionate, powerful, and courageous approach to a 2000 year old story about how God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only son, so that if we believe in him, we'll not die...we'll live--really live!	5.0	All the Passion, No Anti-Semitism or Gratuitous Violence	2004-02-29	3	2	1

THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. And, as I saw at the theatre, there are a lot of adults that can't handle it, either.With more violence than you can shake a stick at, it is not a movie that you sit and enjoy a bucket of popcorn while watching it.With that said, I thought it was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. I was on the edge of my seat while watching it, mainly because of the dread of knowing what was going to happen next, and the uncertainty of how the scourging and crufifixion were to be portrayed. Because of this, I feel like &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot; is more of something to be experienced for yourself.I highly recommend the movie, and I will be very surprised if it does not win a single Oscar next year.	5.0	A movie to be experienced for yourself	2004-07-27	11	8	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A19KVHOG0DGM4P	"Tony Hall ""If the movie stinks, just don't go!"""	I walked away from this film feeling like I'd just left one of the most gory horror movies ever. I mean the movie is non stop Jesus beating from beginning to end. It becomes so monotonous that the constant sound of lashings could almost put you to sleep. I have no problem with Mel Gibson's fondness for gore and violence. However, I thought that the level of violence portrayed in this movie was a)annoying, b)repetitive, c)over dramatic, and d)unrealistic.First, let me explain why I think the violence is unrealistic. For one thing, the Jews have brought Jesus to the Romans to be put to death for blasphemy. The Romans don't want to kill him. After much pressure from the Jews the Roman's reluctantly decide to put him to death. Ok, so you'd assume that a reluctant party would go easy on him right? Wrong. Instead of going easy on him, they treat him WAY worse than any of the other condemned men. Before the Romans agreed to kill him, they agreed to punish him. They thought that this might appease the Jews. So, Pilot sends Jesus off to be punished, but the slap happy Romans get a little carried away and thrash him within an inch of his life. This lengthy beat fest is finally interrupted by a supervisor that scolds them and tells them that they're not supposed to beat him to death. That scene was way over embellished and the reason for the beating being a misunderstanding made me roll my eyes.The prejudice doesn't end there. Not only was Jesus beaten until he looked like Freddy Kruger, but he was also the only condemned man that had to carry his own cross. The others only had to carry the horizontal part. Not only did Jesus have to carry his cross (which was almost too much for him to pick up), but he was beaten the whole way there.I guess what really ruined this movie for me is that only a really religious person could pull off such a gross exaggeration of what most likely happened. To Mel Gibson, the more blood and gore and beating and suffering, the more Jesus loves everyone. Ok, that's understandable... it just doesn't make good cinema.My other problem with the movie are the characters. I'm not a Jew and I don't think the movie is just anti-Semitic propaganda as some people would suggest. HOWEVER... I thought it was terrible the way that Mel portrayed Ponchas Pilot as an innocent man, while dumping the full burden of Jesus' death on the Jews and especially the Jewish high priest. The Jews in the movie are played by unattractive and villainous looking people. They are also portrayed as unreasonable, evil, and bloodthirsty. Although Satan makes a cameo in this film, he doesn't play the bad guy, that's the roll of the Jews. Of course the Jews weren't innocent according to the gospels, but this movie twists reality to give a disproportionate amount of blame to the Jewish people.Another stereotype that I hated in this film was the ever present sadistic Roman. Other than the good guy Ponchas Pilot, nearly every other Roman was a sadistic beast... almost a demon that seemed severely intoxicated and unable to stop torturing. They were portrayed as bumbling evil fools who's arms never stopped slashing and whipping. That was totally unrealistic. I don't think people like that exist. You may have to travel far (to Hell?) to find people that are that stupidly evil.Finally, I thought Satan's first appearance under the bridge was totally Lord-of-the-rings. His first and last appearance was just completely silly and uncalled for. He played no role, just kinda hung out and hissed or occasionally made some monstrous sound. It was totally gay and had no real place in the story. Jesus' character wasn't very prominent in the story either. The only time he actually showed any character was in a flash back to when he was building a table.just a couple of other problems that I had with the film: Due to the fact that the actors had to speak Aramaic and the audience has to read subtitles, everyone spoke in very short sentence or phrases. That's just completely unrealistic. People in that part of the world speak like a million miles an hour. They could probably rattle off a couple pages of text in a few seconds. But in this movie, nobody says more than a couple words at a time. Instead of any meaningful dialog, there's only blood, guts, and gore.The final jab at Jesus when he's been crucified was the last straw for me (as far as the gore factor is concerned). This was just sooo ridiculous I shook my head. To make sure that Jesus was dead, they stabbed him with a spear. This caused Jesus' blood to spray out of his side like a shower head for like 30 seconds. PLEASE! What's next... all of his internal organs spewing out all over the place?! Stop with the over dramatic gore.There were certain things that I liked about the movie. The cinematography was awesome and when I wasn't being annoyed by the exaggerated violence, I was actually kinda enjoying it.Although I seem to really dislike this film, it really wasn't terrible. I realize that Mel Gibson's faith is based on Jesus' suffering and his dad is one of those Jew hating Holocaust deniers, but for an audience of regular Joe's this was just too much. I'd give it a C- and advise older people with heart conditions to stay at home... unlike the lady that had a heart attack during the crucifixion scene on opening night.	1.0	God-Aweful!

It's Easter-themed fun for the whole family, especially if someone in your family speaks Latin, Hebrew, or early Aramaic. Still one of the best films in the zombie genre, this visual tour-de-force also features the most severe and prolonged cinematic beatdown in recent memory.	5.0	You Need Jesus!	2011-09-21	9	0	9

It was a very tearful experience for me. The acting was superb, as well as the script, scenery and cinematography.  I wish that there was more time devoted to the ressurection, but Gibson obviously wanted to have the audience experience the brutality of the last twelve hours first and foremost.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A11JBBA2CQBALB	Tracy Stockton	"""And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns."" Rev. 17:7Mel Gibson uses film making to its utmost potential in this most graphic portrayal of Jesus' passion.  This film is an artist's rendering of historical events through a medium where almost anything is possible.  Did he go too far?  The superficial rendering of the story of the Passion of Christ Jesus is bound to draw sharp criticisms.  It's when you dig beneath the surface that you find great riches.  The first time I saw this movie was by accident, I never meant to see it--too much hype, I thought.  I came across it on TV and thought it was a foreign film; then it dawned on me I was watching Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ.  Though I've prayed the sorrowful mysteries many times, my puny imagination could not have evoked such images as this film portrays.  It brought to my mind the real gravity of our Lord's suffering, that we all take sin so lightly, and we shouldn't.  That's what Mel is saying in this great work of art.  Art, you say?  Great art.  I realized it from my first viewing.  The story is true to the Gospels, the additions are from the visions of Ann Catherine Emmerich and Mel Gibson's use of poetic license, and he works the imagery to great effect.  I instantly recognized that certain of the graphic aspects of the film are inspired by what I always thought were ghastly paintings of Jesus on the Cross that you see so much in Italy, and the book of Revelation--""And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration."" Rev. 17:6.  For instance, in the whipping scene, which garnered so much of the criticism for its violence, you see those images transposed deftly--the androgynous-looking gaunt woman in the black veil with her off-spring (which is corruption), the soldiers drunk at the sight of the blood they draw from the innocent body of Christ with their instruments of torture, he it was that crushed the head of the snake in the Garden--""The infernal serpent . . . whose guile, stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived the Mother of Mankind"" (Milton, Paradise Lost).  And so you are also moved by the juxtaposition of the sweet scenes of Jesus' life and the brutal slaying of this most innocent of men, and you wonder about the gaunt woman threading her way through the crowd as she watches events unfold with fixed eyes of cold fascination.Because this film IS so graphic I do not watch it more than twice a year for fear of becoming jaded, but each time I do I'm struck again and my heart is broken by this man of sorrows, ""[D]espised and rejected of men . . . and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not."" Isaiah 53:2-4. Cheers, Mel, for refusing to let us ignore him."	5.0	Truth imitating Art	2012-04-07	3	2	1

Unpleasant, horribly brutal, violent to the point of making me physically ill, yes... however, it had such a profound effect on me that it could not possibly be explained with words.  Watching this film was definitely not an enjoyable experience..  being confronted with the agony and suffering of the cruxifiction couldn't be..  but the film itself, the symbolism, the message, the portrayal of Christ's life (and obviously death..) were..  incredible.  I don't know how to explain it, other than the fact that the silence in the theater at the end of the film was like none i've ever experienced, and during the film, the grown man next to my was crying like a baby along with my overwhelming sobbing..	5.0	unlike any film i've ever seen	2004-03-03	13	11	2

Throughout the movie, Gibson uses unique scenes and actions from Caviezel to highlight these choices.  The much heralded Satan figure was an effective tool to show the ""world's"" choices for Christ.  For all the inferred anti-semitism, to see the protrayal of the Jewish leaders guilt as anything other an indictment of ""religion"" versus true faith is a stretch.  The Romans are portrayed as equally vicious if not mostly deranged.  Both Jews and Romans are displayed showing pity towards the savaged Christ.This movie undoubtedly will be used for generations to come as one depiction of the last hours of Christ.  Seeing the movie made me want to dive back into the gospels to compare the artistic license and see how Mel Gibson drew certain inferences to flesh out the scenes.  It did not make me think that this would be a substitute for reading the bible.  The violence was graphic but did not reach the point where I had to turn away.

Its not a casual ""lets watch this while we eat dinner"" kind of movie. Its quite unsettling and emotionally poignant. I broke my golden rule of not crying during a movie and I actually shed a few tears, which is saying something for myself. Its not anti-semetic if anyone is wondering. Now for those who don't like to be preached at, don't worry its not heavy handed, but Mel is obviously a believer in his story's source, so just know that its very Christian-sympathetic; its basically the story we all know, except extremely intense and realistic. I think even people who don't like religious movies would enjoy this, because its just that good.

Pontius Pilate came across as being a man of conscious who capitulated to the will of the Jewish leaders, who, in the film, demanded that Jesus be crucified.  He seemed uneasy in discharging duties that would cause harm to Jesus.  Was this historically accurate?  I don't know.Gibson wanted to hammer home the point of Jesus' suffering while almost glossing over Jesus' teachings in flashbacks.  I felt that the Christian message that ""Jesus died for our sins"" wasn't well explained.  Perhaps this is a point of faith.  You either believe it without question because you were told to believe it, or you don't.The Roman soldiers were portrayed as being ignorant imbeciles who enjoyed torturing people.  The Jewish leaders were portrayed as being bloodthirsty.This film is not anti-semitic but I can see why some Jews would feel uncomfortable after watcing it.I'm not sure if the appearance of Satan in the film is also historically accurate.  Was it mentioned in the NT or was this just Gibson taking artistic license?I wouldn't recommend this film for young children or anyone, regardless of how strong their faith is, who doesn't want to see the horrific, flesh ripping torture of a human being.Could Mel Gibson have made his point without the endless mind-numbing torture scenes?  I believe yes.  Others may answer this question, should this film spur the creation of other films about Jesus.The subject matter of this film is as important and significant as they get.  However, subject matter alone doesn't make for a truly outstanding film.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1IYO1VZAMLTTQ	trinity	Mel Gibson did an astounding job directin the Passion of the Christ. I believe that he did not do this with the intentions to make an huge profit from the movie but to illustrate the whole truth of what Jesus Christ went through when he was crucified on the Cross in Calvary.And I was glad that someone realized that Jesus Christ beared alot for salvations of sins. The movie evicted emotions to the audience and made us see that Jesus went through an huge ordeal of suffering from the sins of man so that we can have a chance to be saved.And so, God and man is two different realms. Man is suffering hardship,poverty,pain,violence, hatred because of sin. Thus, God gave us his Son to Us to demonstrate to us to how we can earn our way to everlasting life.Many people think that when God comes to deliver his people he will be all happy and Glad, but I am sorry to break the news to u all, but God is coming to the earth in wrath. And blood will be shed. Man can escape from Man but Man cannot escape from God. Satan, himself, cannot rendure from God's wrath. So, I always thought that the Romans not only just beat and crucify him but Jesus went through what no ordinary or extraordinary man could never endure.What people dont understand is that Satan uses man to do his task. Satan gives man wealth and power to serve his duly purpose. Ans so, yea it was under Romans power that Jesus was crucified, but it was the work of Satan. But, it was the Work of God that made it so, for the sake of his people. And thus, the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ was the final symbolistic power that Satan is soon going to be destroyed when the final days of earth comes.	5.0	I think it was very accurate	2005-04-19	13	10	3

This film is like a mirror: if you have Jesus in your heart it will mirror that back to you in a way that allows you to see Jesus more powerfully - however if you have years of sin and darkness from immoral and even evil behavior, then you will see that clearly too.This is why this film has been so contraversal.One other note - this film was the biggest thing to happen to Hollywood for years and they didn't even mention it at the Oscars. But instead they nominated a film about abortion (Vera Drake), and two films about euthanasia (Million Dollar Baby and The Sea Inside) - it was possibly the darkest moment for this corrupt industry and HUGELY symbolic: when you shut Christ out, murdering babies, and the sick and elderly begin to be applauded as virtuous.

The language idea was fantastic. I enjoyed hearing the real languages and reading the sparce subtitles.2. Costumes are great (except Jesus was draped in a Purple Robe... Jesus was not in this film, or if he was it was not possible to tell with the oozing blood all over his overbeaten body)3. Camera work was good. Sets authentic.1. Bad - Not based on the Bible.2. Bad - Way too violent.3. Bad - They try to make us feel sorry for Rome! Come on people... Gibson is trying to show us that Rome was good and Jews are bad! What a crock!Let's all just remember that the Church is actually ROME! (Heck, It is called the ROMAN Catholic Church!)The Pope is nothing more than a Caesar. Rome hijacked the image of Jesus, warped his message and made hime look like a martyr for the world. (this begs the question... Did Jesus make it to heaven without being a Christian? Afterall, he was a Jew the day he died..) Let's try not to forget that Jesus was himself a Jew and his message was to be a better Jew.This piece of work is more like a Nazi-Propaganda film than a piece of history. And I swear I heard the Jews yell ""Seig Heil"" instead of ""Crucify Him""...Plaese everyone, try reading the Bible prior to viewing this piece of garbage!

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2JA9LYSXZES1A	"""truthandjustice"""	I believe both the negative and the positive reviewers have some valid points that should be considered.  Yes, I agree that, to get to know the whole truth about Jesus that we should know more about his teachings, etc. but on the other hand, the movie is representative of his last twelve hours and that is what it portrays.  It does have some very good flashbacks throughout the movie of Jesus's life and teachings (but not enough for me).  As far as this being taken as anti-semitic, it shouldn't be, because Jesus was a Jew himself and there was a very good reason that he would be betrayed by them (the jealous ones of the temple not the majority of the Jews because Jesus had developed many of them as his followers) and this is shown in Romans 11.  It was because this way all of us, not just the Jews would have eternal life.  God and Jesus both knew everything that would happen, it was not by accident.As far as the violence and suffering that Jesus suffered at their hands, it was indeed true, and in reading the Bible there is a place in it that makes mention of what had been done to Jesus-this is in one of the books of prophecy talking about the end of times, where it describes when the kings see Jesus and see all the atrocities that he took when he took on all our sins, where he is almost unrecognizable as a man or heavenly person.  Then they understood what he had done.  It is not an easy thing to see someone else suffer for the sins we have done, yet by seeing what he went through because God loved us so much and Jesus's love for his Father and us that he would give the ultimate sacrifice, it shows us how much we are loved.  Through his taking on our sins and dying for us, he has defeated Satan. When Satan caused Eve to eat of the tree of Knowledge after God said that they weren't suppose to and that they would die if they did, he made it so that instead of eternal life that we would all die, but God triumphed when Jesus took on our sins.  We have the choice to make whether we want to follow God or Satan's path.One of the most touching scenes in the movie was when his mother kneels and lays down over the spot where Jesus is incarcerated and they both reach to touch each other through the floor, unable to see each other, but knowing they are there.  It brought tears to my eyes.I would have liked to have seen a more glorious ending when Jesus rose from the crypt, but as no human saw it because he was shut up in the sepulcher when it happened, then it was probably as accurate as it could be, and as the movie doesn't show the part where he returns later because the movie is representing only the last hours of his life before he dies on the cross.I knocked off a star because I feel that his teachings were equally important as when he was crucified-not more important, both work together to give us the whole picture.  The actors were great in the film and it certainly showed us God's passion for us.  Enjoy!	4.0	both the negative and positive reviewers have valid points	2004-05-06	7	3	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"It is true that ""The Passion of the Christ"" shows the last hours of Jesus Christ in the most harrowing way possible on the screen, not being afraid of presenting the tortunes Christ must undergo.  However, the film's merit lies not in there; Mel Gibson-directed film shows unexpectedly dramatic aspect of the historical and religious events of 2000 years ago, stressing the humanity of Christ and the people surrounding him.The plot is one of the most famous ones, so I don't repeat it.  The incidents are familiar ones -- from the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane to the crucification -- and Mel Gobson follows these events with the tactful editing and very effective flashbacks that depict equally famous moments in Christ's life -- Madgalene or the Last Supper.  Jim Caviezel literally becomes the image (our most shared image) of the Christ while Monica Bellucici plays Magdalene.  But the most impressive is Maia Morgenstern as Mary, whose pain of watching her only son being killed is more painful to see than the bloody tortune scenes of the film.You already heard the talk about the blood the film shows.  Even though Mel avoids too direct descriptions, it is true that the scenes of the torture and the crucification by the Romans are very graphic.  You can smell the blood, and if you're a kind of a person who haven't seen the recent horror films, prepare for the shock.I said horror, and the allusion should be justified when some scenes really look like that.  The Satan played by Rosalinda Celentano (oh, and ""her voice"" is provided by a male actor) is incredibly spooky, while the last of Judas is, well, as you know, not a happy one to see.But the greatest merit of watching ""The Passion of the Christ"" is, to me, that we can re-experience the incidents which we though we knew.  Actually, the story is a multi-layered one  involving such people as Mother Mary and Pilate, whom the film does not forget to describe.  One of the most touching moments comes with the flashback scenes when the film shows how Christ and his mother talk to each other about one small thing -- a table he made ""which will never catch on.""  To see Mary cares her son as our own mothers do is so full of heart-breaking truth.Yes, the film is too cruel, and the blood could be overshadowing the spiritual aspects of the Christ.  And some say, quite understandably, this could be anti-Semitic though the film is clearly trying to avoid it.  Frankly, I don't know.  All I can ay is that ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a great drama about the love and hate, the tenderness and brutality of us all.  And it works superbly as that."	5.0	For All Its Violent Scenes, I Couldn't Turn My Eyes Off...	2004-05-24	6	4	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1OMC74NPF8DF3	T. Tinker	Despite reading much criticism of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, I find the film to be a convincing re-creation of the world in which Jesus Christ lived and of the Roman oppressions that inspired Hebrew resistance and ultimately Christian resolve to re-create civilization using communitarian rather than totalitarian models.  Dialogue spoken in a language used by ancient inhabitants of the Middle East also lends the film verisimilitude.  Christian orthodoxy insists that acknowledging the miracle of Christ's Resurrection is crucial to Christian faith, but to ordinary Christians, contemplation of Christ's unjust execution motivates commitment to Christian congregational charity more strongly than any assertion or proof of Christ's divinity.  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a fine contribution to a genre that dramatizes Christ's appeal to suffering peoples in many times and places.	5.0	Convincing	2014-04-21	3	2	1
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A385GX0LP1QSKG	"tudortwo ""twodoor2"""	This was BY FAR the goriest, bloodiest movie I ever saw.  If you ever saw how gory Braveheart was, well that was like Sesame Street next to this one. I went to see this with my friend and I thought we were going to be ill several times, I don't recommend you eat before seeing this or if you have a squeamish personality.I think movie goers will fall into three distinct categories:  Catholic, Jewish, and other.If you're a religious Catholic person, you'll love it, and cry your eyes out and pay homage to Mel Gibson, and wonder why this isn't made mandatory viewing for the human race.  It was told toward the Catholic perspective of Christianity.If you're Jewish, you will probably be offended because it does make the Jews look 150% responsible for the death of Jesus.  There's one scene where Satan is walking through a crowd of Jewish priests.  I took that to indicate that there was evil there.  They are also constantly wanting him to be sentenced to death.  The Romans are shown as brutes who, even though they torture Jesus, they are banished from any responsibility of wanting his death.  My friend that went to see this film with me is Jewish and after the movie she told me she felt bad being a Jew, as if she were somehow to blame.If you're another religion besides Catholic or Jewish, or not religious, you'll probably get sick to your stomach from all the violence, blood and gore.I will say it was very well made.  It's all subtitles since they're talking in ancient Hebrew, Latin and Aramaic.  All the characters looked like they stepped out of a Leonard Da Vinci painting.I'm glad I saw it though even though I don't think I could sit through it again.  It's too exhausting to sit through so much violence and torture.  However, I like to form my own opinions instead of hearing the biased views of others.	3.0	Unbiased review	2004-02-27	11	2	9
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	Even though there have been many Hollywood films made about Jesus and His life, I was always a little let down by most of them. Just about every film about Jesus that I've ever seen before THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, glossed over all the pain and suffering Jesus went through. It had always been one of my intentions that if I ever made it in Hollywood, that I wanted to make a film about Jesus and his suffering that was true to scripture and full of all the graphic and vivid details.  About a year ago, I learned of Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and knew then that Mel was basically making the movie I had always wanted to see made.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is exactly that, it is a fairly in-depth look at Jesus's last 12 hours on Earth before His death and all the pain and suffering He went through to save all of humankind. The movie opens with a passage from Isaiah.  Then takes the viewer to the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus is praying with God to take this cup (chalice) from Him. The suffering is so great that He is sweating blood.  In this scene at Gethsemane, Satan is there, whispering from a tree, probably much like he did in Eden.  He tries to convince Jesus that one man cannot possibly bear all the sins of the world.  The scene ends with Jesus stomping on the head of a serpent and the entrance of Judas and the temple troops into the garden.  I mention this scene because it is really the only part in the movie that the spiritual burden of the passion is illustrated: Jesus isn't just preparing to go through extreme physical torture, He is also preparing to take upon Himself all the sins of the world.  This spiritual element is just as important as the physical.The rest of the film follows the story found in the Gospels. Jesus is brought before the Jewish council, then before Pilot, then to Herod, then back to Pilot. He is beaten, then finally sentenced to be crucified.  We follow Him through the streets of Jerusalem to Golgotha where He is nailed upon the cross and dies.  But the story doesn't end there.  The sky turns black, the temple is torn in two, and the ground rumbles with a massive earthquake, and the film ends with a brief scene from the resurrection.The acting in the film is superb.  I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to have so many people speaking languages which until fifteen years ago were considered dead. The cinematography is splendid. The musical score full of vigor and life.  Gibson's direction is practically flawless and now he is probably a better director than he is an actor.As for some of the criticism against the film.  The film is not anti-sematic.  The movie makes a point out of showing how brutal the Romans were in dishing out punishment and death.  Other than a minor beating by the temple guards, the Jewish leaders had very little to do with the actual torture of Jesus.The film is also violent, but that's really the point. Christ endured so much to save us. We often forget that.  However, even though the movie is violent, there have been many other films that I think were much more so.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is probably just as violent as THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, but both films are moving and have strong messages.  Any Quentin Tarantino film ever made is far more violent than THE PASSION. One difference is that in THE PASSION, the violence is all directed towards one man, whereas in most other movies, the violence tends to be spread out amongst several people. ...Overall, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a very moving film, full of vivid images, great acting, sound direction, and a powerful score.  If you view the film with an open mind and heart, it could change your life.	5.0	"""Greater Love Hath No Man Than This"""	2004-02-25	5	4	1

I looked at a couple of people, some were speachless and most were crying. Nonetheless I didn't hear a word. When I thought about it, i realized an applause would have been ridiculous.When someone asked me how the movie was I was going to say it was amazing, but that wouldn't have done the movie justice. The movie was an extremely moving, emotional experience.The cast was absolutely flawless, Jim Caviezel gave a powerful performance as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern as Mary brought me to tears, and even though Monica Bellucci spoke only a few lines, her performance and beauty astonished me. The score was incredible. It had a middle-eastern feel to it, and was timeless and beautiful.Most aspects of the movie were perfect to me. Instead of a squeaky clean version of the life of Jesus it was a realistic and heartbreaking portrayal of his final hours. The Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew languages, and wonderful cinematography made you really feel like you were in first century Jerusalem. The flashbacks truly had an emotional impact on me.While watching this movie I forgot about everything else in the world. Mel Gibson did an incredible job as a director and he truly was brave for taking on this project despite all the controversy.As for the two main concerns of most people, the ultra-violence, and the alleged anti-semetism these are my views on the two.Everything people are saying about the violence is true. It is brutal, gory, and quite possibly the most violent work in cinematic history. This R-Rating is very well justified and an NC-17 would have made sense. If you are the type of person that cannot bear violence, this is definately not the movie for you. Some scenes of torture last about 10 minutes when you feel you've seen enough after 30 seconds. But, the violence I feel was absolutely necessary. The movie is about the suffering/passion of Jesus, and turning the camera away would not have an impact on you. The movie shows what Jesus actually went through for all of mankind's sins (according to Christianity). Mel Gibson did not exagerate the violence or make it look like horror movie or Kill Bill violence. As Jay Leno said on his show the other night, when Jesus was hit it felt like WE were being hit as opposed to other violent movies were you feel like YOU are the one hitting the person. I don't think anyone can say that every single hit upon Jesus didn't affect him/her somehow.As for the anti-semetism in the movie, I didn't find it was as bad as everyone is making it out to be. The thing that made me see why people were criticizing Mel Gibson for was that instead of spreading the blame somewhat on the Jewish high priests (Sanhedrin) and mostly on Pilate, 99% of the blame was put on the Sanhedrin, which seemed false to me considering that historically it is known that Pilate was a vicious monster, and in the movie he seems like a gentle person and reluctant to crucify Jesus. I simply didn't buy the fact that Pilate would be so nice. The movie can be considered anti-first-century-Romans, and anti-Sanhedrin, but I did not feel the movie was attacking the Jewish religion, or the entire Jewish people. But the movie is not anti-semitic for these reasons: 1. It is made evident that it was Jesus' prophecy and destiny is to die. He could probably have escaped from Gethsemane or even the cross (if he truly had ''powers''). He was born to die, and there is no blame to be placed on anyone. If anything, the Romans of that time are portrayed horribly (though realistically), and they are the ones that made him suffer tremendously before his death. 2. Basically all the ''Good Guys'' in the movie are Jewish. Jesus himself was a Jew, Mary was, The man that helped Jesus carry the cross was Jewish, Veronica the woman that brought Jesus water and wiped his face was, and many Jews were screaming in the crowd against the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. (Personally, I don't know why Pilate was portrayed so nicely. It's not like the Jews had the ultimate power. It was ultimately HIS decision to have Jesus crucified.)An aspect of the film that intrigued me was the character of Satan, and the demons in the movie. When I first found out Satan was in the movie, I was scared it would be a red man with horns and a pitchfork, but he/she is portrayed subtly. Everything about him/her was very Eerie.Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for making this film. He made the movie the way HE thought it was and though most historians or even religious figures would not agree completely to what happened, it is a general idea as to what those final hours were. When reading the new testament or hearing the story of Jesus, it's hard to understand what it was actually like for Jesus to go through all that pain, and what it was like for Mary to watch her son get tortured and crucified. The movie really put things in perspective for me.Some people are criticizing him for adding things never written in the gospels such as demons harassing Judas Iscariot, most scenes with Satan, and the torture from Gethsemene to the Jewish court, but he had to fill the blanks in the Gospels with what he thought might have happened.In conclusion, not everyone will like this movie. Some will love it, and some will hate it. But, I think that if you can endure the extreme violence and torture you should at least see it before you judge it.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AYQF4Z1EQDACU	Tyler Reece	The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better ,but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie, you might think it will be boring, so did I ,but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics, then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace, the Power, the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel.	5.0	The Last Twelve Hours	2004-07-13	0	0	0
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2XXCOD6KQHTFG	"""tzivkovic"""	I saw this movie the weekend it was released. I was very intrigued to see it, partly due to the hype, but mostly due to the fact that I grew up in a Traditional Catholic household and was happy to finally see what I believed being portrayed in the mainstream.I thought the movie was very well done and I applaud Mel Gibson and all those involved in the movie for taking the risk that they did to make this movie. Yes, a risk. If most people haven't noticed, Hollywood is full of gas bag liberals interested in destroying anyone professing a faith in God from a Christian perspective. They will destroy your careers if you open your mouth to say you disagree with the mainstream media.That aside, the movie was intense, but those of us who believe Jesus Christ is God and died for us, know that it was a blood bath. There are descriptions written on the what truly happened. And normally when you are whipped that many times, have thorns pushed into your skull, and are beat to the point no one really recognizes you, there will be a bit of blood.And for those people who think it was a bad movie because you didn't get more of what Jesus was all about or His teachings, you really missed the point of the movie. It's about Jesus' LAST 12 HOURS of life on earth. During that time, He really wasn't preaching to the general public. He did that before those last hours. Gibson is a Catholic. He knows the teachings of Jesus. I am a Catholic and grew up being taught those teachings as well. I have an understanding of Jesus and His teachings. For those lacking that knowledge and wanting it, I suggest picking up a book.	5.0	Unbelievable	2004-07-16	3	2	1

I was captivated by the fluidity of the entire film.Those who say this film is excessively violent have obviously not been to the movies in quite a while.  I have seen more than a few movies that were much more violent that this one.As for the rants of anti-Semitism..........no, I had seen none in this film.  I think everyone who sees this film and believes in Jesus knows that WE are all to blame for his death.  Not the Jews, not the Romans.....WE ARE ALL TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.I must admit that in my younger days of ignorance I felt the Jews were responsible for our Saviours death, but with age comes wisdom and a clear mind and understanding.  They are not to blame.........I am, we are.....There is a scene in the film where Jesus states ""No one takes my life from me, I GIVE IT UP MYSELF.""  That says it all.  Our sins put him on the cross.....There are some references to details portrayed in the book ""The Dolorous Passion of Jesus Christ"" by Anne Catherine Emmerich as well.  The scene in the garden with Jesus and satan is described in the book; the brutality is described in great detail as well.  If you want a good companion to the Holy Bible in regards to the Passion, read this book!The movie was done exceptionally well, the cinematography was excellent.  The score was captivating.  As I listen to the score now, I can see flashes of the film and some scenes did bring tears to my eyes.....  As Mary runs to Jesus when he falls under the burden of the cross (our sins), as he is scourged mercilessly by the Roman guards.....as God weeps and a single teardrop falls to earth and the world knows of his sorrow as his only Son dies.......I recommend this movie for all people.  I wouldn't have any child see this film unless they understand the story of our Saviour.  Even then, it may be too harsh.Excellent film.......I hope more films of the Religious nature are made and stay as true to the Gospels as this one has.Jim Caviezel and Maia Morgenstern deserve Oscar nominations as well as Mel for directing.

Wade or uncritical support of the present administration, and so on. . .. . . I realize now the reason why Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ,* which I understand is steeped in singularly Catholic theology, full of iconography and lore that the evangelicals' forebears would have derided as ""Papistickal claptrap,"" could achieve such pan-Christian appeal. It was because the making of this film was more a political act than a devotional one. It gave both conservative Catholics and evangelicals an excuse to drop the cudgels of a centuries-old antagonism and rally around the pet project of a well-heeled schismatic madman. The film became an emblem of insularity and the absolute rejection of the liberalizing tendency of the last hundred years. It is a *fasces* in the pure etymological sense -- an axe carried before both the conservative Catholic and evangelical Christian with the purpose of smashing the coupling between them and the train of history.As below, so above, I guess."	2.0	The Cash-in on the Christ	2006-02-06	50	10	40
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2NVICA0FCP9ES	"Vader ""SG"""	"In the past, I had always been a bit disappointed with Jesus films. In King of Kings, Jesus was played by a man who has often been referred to as ""Malibu Jesus"" for his blue eyes and sandy/dirty blond hair. And in Jesus of Nazareth AND the aforementioned K.O.K., the lack of realism in the sufferings of Christ. They both did a good job overall of shwing what Jesus was all about, but the Bible is very clear in the prophecies of Isaiha Ch. 52 & 53, and in Psalms 22 that Jesus was to be beaten to the point where He was hardly recognizable. Well this movie DELIVERS. I was moved deeply. I cried and was even shaking a bit during the scourging scene which took about 10 minutes to get through. Never before has there been a more Biblically accurate portrayal of the gift of God's love through His Son's sacrifice on the cross. Every blow, every rip in His flesh was taken for my sake. Through Him I have forgiveness and am reconciled to God the Father. I have been a Christian for most of my life. I accepted that gift of salvation a long time ago. But this film made it that much more real. Seeing such a realistic depiction of what I've read for years and believed on, and saw in my minds eye...well, it has changed my life. Jim Caviezel played the role beautifully. And there are some wonderful stories surrounding the making of the film. He should get an Academy Award, but the anti-Christ Hollywood will make sure that doesn't happen. Heck the whole film should be ""Best Picture"" and the many of the actors who played in this SHOULD win awards. His eyes were brown and his hair dark, add to that the fact that he himself is Jewish and you've got a pretty believable looking Jesus of Nazareth. The reviews you've heard of the anti-semitism could not be further from the truth. They are in fact, lies. Lies aimed at silencing the message of Jesus. It hasn't worked. In fact, the movie has made well over 100M thus far, and it's only been out around a week. IF you want to know about God's love, and you want to see a concise and powerful account of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life (and the resurrection), then go see this movie a.s.a.p.!

It does, however, capture what is the greatest act of love ever performed.  For a God who needs nothing from us, to humble himself and take on our form, to resist every temptation to give us a yardstick to live by, and then to be abused for OUR transgressions and weakness is just so indebting.  I watch this not for cinematic value, but for what I believe Gibson intended for us to see, the passion that Christ had for us, that drove him to give up everything. It is a great reset button. I watch this and want less to spend my time enjoying the things of this world, but communion with him.  I hope it gives you what it gives me.  God bless.	5.0	Love it!	2011-02-05	6	4	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AU5SQBPSNOIM	"Vanissa W. Chan ""vandelist"""	Mel Gibson's The Passion of The Christ is unassuming, and true to Biblical literature and Catholic theology (see The Dolorous Passion of Christ by Anne Catherine Emmerich). He also artfully and beautifully illustrates the dichotomy of good and evil, and a humanity that is faced to side either of the extremes. Visually stunning with awe-inspiring cinematography, it is more than telling with every scene what Gibson implies: praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus is weak, afraid, and taunted. Having Satan appear in this scene reminisces of the temptation of Christ, with Satan's presence meant to discourage him, and Satan's words telling Christ the burden is to heavy for a man to carry. (In Luke, it is mentioned that Jesus is so distraught during this time that an angel from heaven appears to console him, but it appears that starting with this first scene, Gibson's film would be a combination of the Gospels, not obedient to one Gospel, but to all of them.)Gibson is very articulate with every second that goes by. The characters are so conflicted and confused during such a catastrophic event that their sufferings are intense in their moments of remorse (i.e., Judas, Peter, Pilate). Gibson&#65533;s imagination supplements well with what Scripture has to offer, as at some points the Gospels are rather lacking in detail. I also especially enjoyed the Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. It indeed added to the realism of the story, something that is immensely lacking in any other Jesus film.Before viewing this film, I would say it would be wise to review the Gospels. It is only those who are familiar with Scripture who will come to realize how beautifully Gibson brings Christ&#65533;s story to life, and how he succeeds in doing so without any assumption (especially with the characters &#65533; Pontius Pilate being a sympathetic, conflicted character is NOT a myth, it is Biblical; the high priests being inhumane and blood thirsty, also Biblical).The aftermath of the release of such a film will be interesting. I will not be surprised if a comparison between this and The Exorcist will be brought to light, which should be a delight. Both films are directed by men of great faith, whose intentions include expressing their love for religion, the intensity of what is inside their hearts, and also to shock, frighten, and inspire people back into their faith.I will enjoy The Passion of the Christ again and again.	5.0	breathtaking and accurate....much respect to Gibson.	2004-03-08	6	3	3
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1C9PUR75QQJBM	varhou	Many people mock and ridicule Jesus Christ but I think after watching Passion of the Christ many would change their attitude towards Jesus Christ. Mel Gibson does a marvellous job at showing the world what it would've been like for Jesus Christ the day he was crucified. Jesus Christ deserves respect and admiration for what he went through for what he believed in and Mel Gibson has done a fantastic job at showing people how it would've been like. If anyone mocks Jesus Christ I ask them have they watched Passion of the Christ and 9 times out of 10 they haven't. Those that have from my experience have changed their attitude towards Jesus Christ thanks to Mel Gibson's movie. However, Jesus Christ's life wasn't just about the crucifixtion but also, the resurrection. I was disappointed to see Mel end the movie after Jesus' death. I think the story is really incomplete because the resurrection is just as important. With that said this is one movie I would recommend to anyone even those who don't believe in Jesus Christ.	5.0	What can I say? It's a breathtaking!	2005-10-16	4	3	1

I usually watch a movie and find hundreds of mistakes or inaccuracies that drive me crazy. I try not to let this bother me too much as I watch movies so that I can enjoy myself. However... when there are blatant mistakes and misrepresentations on religious subject matter... it ticks me off! My 4 year old son shares the same gift with me. The other day he was watching ""Jesus"" by Inspirational Films and he came running out of the room saying, ""They forgot to put the crown of thorns on Jesus!""As I watched this film, I was blown away by the fact that Mel Gibson left nothing out. I usually watch, critique and wonder why they never mentioned or why they didn't show this or that. The Passion of the Christ had EVERYTHING in it! As I watched... I knew exactly what was supposed to happen next... and it DID happen. I was never let down! I was amazed. I knew exactly who Veronica was 10 minutes before she offered her veil to Jesus. I loved seeing His image on the veil. I loved seeing Mary meet Jesus on His way. I love Simon of Cyrene helping Jesus carry His cross. Even down to the soldiers casting lots for His clothes... It was very well done with attention to detail. I loved the Aramaic and Latin. I love Mass in Latin. We still pray in Latin here at home so it was nice to have it spoken and be able to understand on the big screen. Something most people probably wouldn't appreciate, but for those of us who love ecclesiastical Latin, it was a rare treat.I know that Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel went to Daily Mass and received the Eucharist EVERY DAY. They went to Confession throughout the entire filming of this and really tried to make sure that they would do justice to this important event. It is obvious that Christ is present in Jim Caviezel as he moves across the screen. It doesn't even look like Jim Caviezel! The Sermon on the Mount is my FAVORITE! LOVE YOUR ENEMIES - That is hard to do... what a challenge! I fell in love with Jesus over and over again while experiencing the film.It was everything I had ever imagined Christ's suffering to be. My husband and I agree that it gave us images we have been longing for. It has improved our prayer life this Lenten season because we now have moving images we can reflect on as we pray our traditional Lenten prayers such as The Stations of the Cross and The Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary. As Catholics, we learn our Faith with the aid of religious art. We see images of Christ all the time. We know what a scourging is... we know what happened. We've seen it in paintings... but this film has deepened that knowledge by giving us moving images. We see the blood dropping. We see the flashbacks to the Last Supper. We now have vivid moving imagery that we can reflect on while at Mass. WOW!!!The Sacrifice of the Cross and the Sacrifice of the Altar are the same thing and Mel Gibson did a wonderful job explaining that with this film. You would have to be blinded by pride not to get it after seeing this film. Catholicity at it's best!!!I pray for the unification of Christians and that all of the Christian churches that broke away from the One True Church will put aside their own interests and see that Christ founded one Church and gave us a visible shepherd to guide us and settle any dispute among us. ""The CHURCH is the pillar and foundation of truth""...1 Timothy 3:15 The Church is Divine and human. It is full of saints and sinners. A Christian is a sinner who is trying to be holy! We shouldn't be trying to get Christ to join our church, we should put aside selfishness and pride and join His Church."	5.0	Authentic Catholicity in a Blockbuster!!! WOW!	2004-03-16	8	5	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ANH41QS8QBX42	"Victor Lavigne ""the irregular viewer"""	"Having watched this movie, I came away wondering about the accuracy of the film as I heard reviewers discussing about it.  A lot of the dialogue and events in the film just didn't come out of the Bible as I remembered, so I went and reread.  And I must say, I think Gibson definitely added a lot of substance to this movie, at the obvious risk of losing to accuracy.  But I think it was probably needed, as the story (as related by Matthew Mark and Luke) doesn't have the amount of detail to make a good movie.The gore and violence were over the top.  As one reviewer here has already stated, losing that amount of blood during a scourging would leave a person unable to stand, much less carry a heavy cross the way Jesus was shown to do.  Also, running nails through hands and feet would definitely NOT lead to blood draining out, as shown in this film.  As Gibson pounds nails though the hands and cross, blood is seen running out and pouring onto the ground.  This is completely fictional, unless the nails were hollowed out with blood grooves, as anybody who is experienced with this sort of thing knows.  The object piercing the body seals off the skin around it, and typically you have a bloodless wound with this type of piercing.I think Gibson's vision of Satan (another addition by Gibson to the story) was drawn from modern horror films.  The black-hooded, menacing figure with bugs crawling though his body just seems so Stephen King.  I am reminded of the Bible's own depiction of Satan as ""masquerading as an angel of light"" 2Co 10:15, which would make Satan a beautiful creature to see.As a movie with a vision of the suffering of Christ, this certainly holds its own and is doubtful ever to be replaced.  This movie is shocking and mesmerizing, as was its intent.  But please, no more about ""accuracy"" and ""drawn straight from the scriptures.""  If it is, I'd like to see that version of the Bible for myself."	3.0	Inspiration, not accuracy is this story	2004-09-26	15	11	4
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2AOCMTCD0JAAT	"Victor Mariscal ""Roguemaster83"""	One would think that Mel Gibson is crazy, or even weird to have even wanted to make a movie like this. However, one has to admire this about him, he's got guts. Also, one would have to wonder whether the violence in this film was a bit overkill. Gibson has gotten quite a bit of criticism for the violence seen here, but let's be fair. What about Saving Private Ryan, the Kill Bill movies, Bad Boys II? What about them? Schindler's List also shows us violence and horrors in a realistic and horrifying way, and yet that movie hasn't gotten anywhere near the criticism as The Passion of the Christ. I don't think it's fair that The Passion is the target of so much criticism while others aren't.I must warn you, this is not for the weak of heart. The violence in this film is something not to be taken lightly. You're going to see things which you can't even believe. I recommend against letting any of your kids see it if they're really young. If you think they're old enough (maybe 17 and older), then I say at least consider it.Speaking of Schindler's List, I consider it and The Passion of the Christ, in a sense, in the same ballpark. Here's why. They're both true stories. They both tell of human suffering. They both tell of a man who has an impact on the world. They both occur during periods of turmoil. They are both told in a realistic, horrifying, violent way. Of course, while the violence in Schindler's List is rather brutal, everything I've seen suggests that the violence in Gibson's work makes that pale in comparison.I suggest that when you finally do see this film, you see it with an open mind.

The careful detail that the staff ( and of course, Mel Gibson )follows is simply INCREDIBLE. I thought that I was REALLY witnessing Jesus during His terrible ordeal.The fact that the movie is spoken in the original language that Jesus spoke, and the Romans spoke, places the re-creation at so high a level that is impossible to describe. You just have to sit and watch. Nothing else for the spectator to do.I never thought that mortal people could reproduce this crucial part of Jesus' life ( and death )with such reality.Concerning the accusations of antisemitism, they just don't fit. With the same logic you might say that The Bible is antisemitic.To be more specific, for example, when Simon de Cirene helps Jesus to carry The Cross, the Romans call him: ""Jew"" and not in a pleasant way. But in spite of being a Jew, Simon helps Jesus and defends Him.You might say that the Romans are antisemitic. Has somebody said it ?"	5.0	The Passion of Christ	2006-02-13	19	11	8
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A14HMP62A37RVX	Viewer	I finally rented The Passion, today, to see what all the controversy was about, and how the movie was depicted, and quite frankly, I was very disappointed.  The acting was not the greatest, the story is not Biblically based, but rather taken from the visions of a 19th century nun named Catherine Anne Emmrich, and her book The Dolorous Passion.  Things like the scenes with Satan chatting with Jesus, the table and chair scene with Mary, the overflogging of Christ, the quick jump to an odd resurrrection scene, are simply Mel's version of what he believes happened.  I did not come away with any sense of salvation or Christ's teachings and purpose on Earth, but rather with a sad feeling that most people who rave about this movie have never read the Bible, nor have any grounding in history or theology, but will still take this as the Gospel truth, which it is not.  For a much more accurate portrayal of the life of Christ-the entire life of Christ-please rent or purchase the mini-series Jesus of Nazareth, starring Robert Powell, and get the true message of Christianity, no matter what denomination you are.	1.0	Not as good as you think!	2004-08-31	60	30	30
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A85AS1GBB54GP	"Vincent J. Mulvihill ""vjm"""	The film succeeds in its stirring of the soul, and is shot expertly (this is easily Gibson's strongest feature, cinematically), but I didn't need to see one of the most poignant stories of the last 2,000 years turned into a horror flick.  The beatings, even though violence is a great release in movies, are just too, too much.  A joke is floating around currently, suggesting that the DVD of this movie will come complete with a bonus disc of Christ being beaten up by Jews for an additional 78 minutes.The role of the Jews - a very controversial topic indeed - is handled 'as it is written', to steal the phrase, in the New Testament.  However, research shows that Jews didn't really have all that much say in those days and lived in what could be termed, in modern venacular, a police state.  Though they were not treated as badly as in 1940s Europe, they certainly had comparable rights (or lack thereof).  To say that Jews killed Christ is akin to suggesting Jews had the deciding vote in Germany invading France.  Not likely, on both counts.But Gibson is not trying to tell it how it was, he's telling us how it affects him as an artist and a man.  And on those two counts, he succeeds - probably better than any interpretation of the story since Scorcese.	3.0	Lethal Whippin'	2004-03-25	6	3	3

Even the cheeziest horror flicks provide some suspense before they flood the screen with gore. Showing a guy getting beat up for two hours is simply lazy film-making.As someone who has done advanced work in ancient history, I'm amused by the claim that this is a truthful representation of historical events.  A crowd under Roman rule would not have been allowed to influence a death sentence -- the Roman governor would have been the only person with such authority. The notion that the wife of Pontius Pilate would have taken pity on Jesus is impossible, not to mention the fact that the episode is not contained in the New Testament.  Anyone familiar with the ways of governing Romans would laugh at the idea that any Roman present would have shown any degree of sympathy.Finally, as a Christian, I find this film highly insulting to my religion.  None of the basic messages of the New Testament -- love, mercy, forgiveness, humbleness -- is conveyed.  My religion is not a violent, blood-thirsty, or self-righteous one.	1.0	Failure On All Three Levels	2006-08-06	40	18	22
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2ZDDSDFJ5IBVL	Vince Page	"I took the 9th Grade Sunday School class to see ""The Passion of the Christ "" on February 29th and I must say that it was a very intense movie. If you have ever wanted to be there when Christ walked the earth to see for yourself what happened, this movie definitely achieves the objective. The movie starts in the Garden of Gethsemane when Christ is praying and all the apostles fall asleep on him, but you feel like you are there, just as you do throughout the entire movie.This movie also fills a void in the lineup of Christian movies that I have seen since it is the only one which truly makes us appreciate the suffering that Christ underwent for our sake. All other movies I have seen on Christ's Passion tend to sterilize the experience and protect us from the torture that Christ willingly endured for us. I'm glad I saw it. The Stations of the Cross will never again be the same for me; I will never again take them for granted as I have in the past. This is a good thing, and for this reason alone I am recommending the movie to all my friends and family.The scenes involving Christ's torture are very realistically done and very historically accurate. The ""cat of nine tails"" that he is scourged with at the pillar is a true reproduction of the device used not only by the Romans, but by seafaring captains in the days of sailing ships as well. In my opinion, a teenager should be able to watch and appreciate Christ's suffering in this movie, but pre-teens should wait. It's simply too much for them.The reports we all heard of the films' anti-Semitism are very baffling. Not once during the entire film did it ever occur to me that I was watching any anti-Jewish bigotry. On the contrary, the real bad guys - who seemed to enjoy everything they were doing to Jesus - were the Romans. These are the guys I wanted to kick in the groin. Too bad none of them are left.The bottom line is that this is not a movie you will enjoy, but it is a movie you will appreciate, and I feel that it will move you closer to Christ by making you able to appreciate his suffering more than you ever have in the past."	5.0	A movie you will appreciate	2004-06-21	8	5	3

I don't at all think it's anti-semetic or too violent but to me it was just pointless and boring. I can't see how anyone would find this to be moving or inspiring. For one thing, all they focused on was the beating and crucifiction. They never focused on Jesus's life or his teachings, or accomplishments. I consider myself to be a Christian moderate and I don't believe in everything the church preaches but with all the hype around this film, I expected more. I frankly want to know what moved or inspired anyone here because this was nothing more but a two hour snuff film disguised as something with a spiritual message. I understand the point of showing the gory details to try to convince people to change thier lives but the fact that it's fake really takes away from the effect.	1.0	Talk about overrated	2006-02-20	44	20	24
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3LQ6XMR25MRJ9	"Vlad Cuellar ""vlad"""	"This movie is a painful experience to watch. Its well made and well shot but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I personally, don't believe that Jesus was son of God, in fact its doubtful that he ever existed since there is no tangible proof unlike that of other prophets. Gibson and the people who were strongly affected by this film are devout Christians so to them it must feel like some kind of personal moving experience. I simply watched it as a film. Its a good movie, with good actors and it looks very realistic. However there are some hard to believe parts in here that make the film a bit of a farce. First off, why is there a bald guy in a black cloak as Satan even seen in the film? His appearance is very cartoonish in my opinion, not seeing ""Satan"" on screen would've made me take the movie a lot more seriously. Even so, the film is simply Brutal! Jesus is brought before Pilate and the first time he tells his soldiers just to beat Jesus up. But the Romans are very Sadistic! 3 burly bald toothless Romans grab switches and whips and they beat Jesus for what feels like an eternity. He's reduced to a bloody mound of meat. The detail is disgustingly REAL. As if that weren't enough he's ""crowned"" with his crown of thorns and presented before the crowd of Jews. The rabbis still not satisfied want Jesus crucified. I can see why present-day Jews get angry at this depiction, because its made quite obvious that it was the Jews not the Romans who killed Jesus. Pilate didn't even want him punished, but the rabbis insisted. The crucifixion scene is of course agonizing. Once again the details are a sadists' delight. I think this movie is good but not great by any means. It's done very well at the box office and it will be a HUGE money maker, so in conclusion its a great success just not a great movie."	3.0	Brutal Biblical Epic!	2004-03-24	3	1	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	"This movie had a deeply profound affect on me, not my religious beliefs, not my historical knowledge, but on ME as a person. Despite all the rhetoric involved in the release, the promotion and the hype it clearly sends a message to humanity.....to suffer for your fellow man is the ultimate sacrifice but it will lead to the greatest of honor.This extraordinary film is the re-enactment of the passion as explained in the four books of the Gospel. It helps to read these books prior to the film if you are not familiar with the story or if you want to be able to compare and contrast Gibson's idea to the truth as told within the Bible. Most of the film is very dark but brings to light historical figures that lived in a time of horrible brutality. If crimes were punished in a similar way today I doubt we would have many criminals! Christ knows his direction in life and has willingly accepted his own death in order to save the sins of humanity. Whether or not you believe the religious theory behind this sacrifice the story represents what all humans should be willing to do for the life of another. This movie is absolutely brutal and so graphic that the faint at heart will have to turn away, but don't, the least we can do for this historical figure is watch a movie that depicts His suffering. As for the anti-Semitism that was so widely touted I didn't see it. To be honest with you I felt angrier at the Romans for the relentless beating they gave to Christ. But it isn't a class, gender or race issue that is involved in this story it is about humanity as a whole and how we resort to violence instead of acceptance towards the things we don't understand. All creeds, religions and sects have authorized brutal killings for the sake of their faith so no one is more able to wipe their hands of Christ's death than any other.James Caviezel plays the part of Jesus Christ with such perfection you will feel as though you have been transported back in time and are actually meeting the image of the man Himself. This role required a great deal from Caviezel, demanding endurance and exhibiting compassion without going overboard as so many other actors have done in the past. The film is spoken in Aramaic and Latin (with sub-titles) and Caviezel is flawless in his accent bringing even more depth to his portrayal. By the end of this movie the only thing that can move on Caviezel is his eyes and in those last subtle shifts of movement his acting becomes something phenomenal. Beside Caviezel in her role as Mary Magdalene is Monica Bellucci whose loyalty and soft determination follows Christ to His grave along with Mother Mary (played by Maia Morgenstern). The women are the strength of this film just as I imagine them to have been in real life although they were ostracized by the men who wrote the Bible. Rosalinda Celentano is the ever present Satan that horrible evil that lurks in every nook and cranny of this film and she is downright scary. Caiphas is presented as a vindictive man and is played nicely by Mattia Sbragia. Close to Caviezel in excellence is Hristo Shopov cast as the powerful but weak Pontius Pilate. The truly amazing thing is that none of the actors in this film are really ""stars"" but they all succeed in their roles with a grace and spirit that stands above the fluff and muster of Hollywood.Mel Gibson has done something here that surpasses bravery, he has taken a highly controversial subject (religion and faith), stayed very close to the story as told in the Gospels and dared to put his own funding up to support it, so is he crazy or was he driven to bring a taste of faith back into a hollow humanity. Not only is this film beautiful to watch but it is as accurate a story as can be told based upon historical and religious records. The music is haunting and magical. The use of foreign language a feat in its own right for American audiences who would rather eat popcorn than read subtitles. But Gibson's real gift is how he manages to inspire something in people who see this film, it may be tears, compassion, renewed faith, anger, spite or indifference but at least it stirs up something in a massive audience of people who all too often don't have to feel anything while watching a film. If you don't walk away from this film feeling changed inside and willing to see Christ as a human being who loved more than himself then the sadness rests with you."	5.0	Passionate	2004-09-03	12	9	3

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A12RYA1QNP9HOG	"V ""Stupid should hurt..."""	"I've read many of the reviews posted here, both of those that loved the movie and of those that didn't even like it (and of those in-between); I've spoken to people who have seen the movie - even some in the same theater with me - and I came to this conclusion:  a lot of people weren't ready for 'The Passion of the Christ'.  This movie - a true blockbuster - was a far cry from the CGI graphics-laden superhero stuff we as a movie audience have become increasingly comfortable with.  I couldn't remember the last movie I saw with lines around the block that didn't have hobbits, super villains, or leather-trench coat wearing hero trying to save mankind from machines.I have to commend Mel Gibson for his dedication and COURAGE to see this project through... it must have been difficult, and I'm sure he'll continue to hear some criticism about it.  As a stand-alone movie reference to the Bible, 'The Passion' doesn't offer much...  as a tribute to the life of Jesus, this movie would be considered woefully lacking in several areas.  As a means of converting non-believers into believers, Mr. Gibson probably failed miserably.  (I even heard grumblings concerning the film being done in Latin, with English subtitles.  The same people who complained about the so-called inaccuracies of the movie are complaining because he didn't speak in English.  What kind of accent was he supposed to have - Brooklyn?  For all of you I heard saying you'd like a time machine so you could go back and see things for yourself... you'd still need to brush up on your Latin, because THEY DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH BACK THEN!)  'The Passion of the Christ', however, is not - nor was it ever intended to be - any of the above.  'The Passion' had a single purpose: recount the last 12 hours of Jesus' life here up to his crucifixion.  With that in mind, this movie was nothing short of phenomenal.Perhaps the title of the movie itself led to misconceptions about what the film was indeed going to portray - either way, many in the audience seemed shocked and puzzled by the contents of the movie.  What kind of sick 'passion' was Mel Gibson going for here?  Probably the kind that Jesus felt.  (Latin origins of the word 'passion' refer to suffering and pain; Christian theology later broadened that to include Christ's love for mankind, which made him willing to suffer and die for us.)  Aside from those who would dispute Jesus' facial features, or the skin complexions of the civilization as a whole, what was portrayed on film here was likely the most accurate representation of this monumental event to date.  I think it's ridiculously naive of people to believe that the actual crucifixion (and Jesus' treatment in the hours prior) was significantly less violent than what was shown here.  Somehow, I doubt it went like this: ""Alright Jesus... we find you guilty of blasphemy - claiming to be the King of the Jews, and the Son of God... you are to be crucified.  Now go home and think about that, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.  Get some rest.""  I don't know... I wasn't there - born a full 1,979 years later.  Gonna go with my gut on that one.At numerous times during the movie I found myself turning away from graphic violence on the screen... to the point where I wanted to say ""that's enough - go on to the next scene.""  And that was just me watching a movie - can you imagine what it must have felt like to endure that torture?  It was then that I realized what the movie was truly about.  Jesus DID endure that torture... and held strong.  For mankind.  Even as they were crucifying him, he prayed for them.Anyone familiar with the Bible will find numerous references to events (obviously).  This movie was not - I repeat NOT - about the teachings of Jesus... if that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed.  It barely touches His resurrection.  There were no fancy special-effects-heavy conversations between Jesus and God.  Even Satan's appearances in the film weren't overbearing, but unsettling nonetheless.  What the movie set out to do, from the beginning, I feel was accomplished in nearly-perfect fashion.  'The Passion of the Christ' will move you, may upset you, and will probably forever change you.  There wasn't a dry eye in the theater. (though most of the men waited until after the movie and then let it out in either the bathroom or the car)Overall, I thought this was an outstanding movie.  Graphic, for sure - this is not a movie for kids, and one that I felt definitely merits it's R-rating. (I'm shocked it didn't get an NC-17...  it probably would have had the movie been about anyone other than Jesus)5 Stars... a must-see."	5.0	The Passion...	2004-03-01	1	0	1

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	AUI1CD10AE2J4	"Wade A. Tisthammer ""Minnesotan"""	"The Passion of the Christ depicts the last twelve hours before his crucifixion and death.  But what about some of the stuff before that?  Fortunately, there are multiple flashbacks so that it can cover a little more ground.The movie begins with haunting music together with dark and cool color themes (color themes are used often in the movie).  At night, a bright blue moon with thick layers of mist on the dark garden, appropriately matching the given scene of Gethsemane.  With all the dialogue in Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin (don't worry; there are English subtitles) and the ethereal music, there is an intensely artistically feel throughout the movie, to the extent it is somewhat difficult for one to enjoy or dislike the movie in any conventional sense.  Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing the film, on par with his Oscar winning movie Braveheart.  Gibson, I think, has earned at least a nomination with this film.The depth of the character of Jesus is developed more fully than most movies on the life of Christ and greatly emphasizes his humanity.  Here we see Jesus not just a stoic and solemn teacher, but also facets of definite fear and reluctance in the sacrifice he is called to make for humanity, and not wanting the other disciples (only three were with him at the scene at Gethsemane) to see him like this.  Flashbacks later show him in lighthearted moods of cheerfulness and even playfulness.  Jesus really does come across as very human character, even though the divine aspect is not neglected in the film.What about historical accuracy?  I'll mention a few points here.  Pontius Pilate is plausibly portrayed.  If he does not execute Jesus, he fears a rebellion from Caiphas.  But if he does execute Jesus, he fears that Jesus' followers may start a rebellion.  Either way, he fears that we will get in trouble with Caesar (a rebellion would not make Pilate look in control of the region) and thus tries to walk a tightrope somewhere in between.  This is reasonable since in 31 C.E. Pilate's protector/patron Sejanus fell from power because he was plotting against the emperor.  This would have made Pilate's position very weak in 33 C.E. (the date Jesus was probably crucified), so it's quite reasonable that he would have been unusually careful to prevent getting into further trouble with Caesar.  The crucifixion however is less realistic however.  Jesus would most likely have been nailed at the wrists, not in the palms as we see in some traditional paintings.For those of you wanting their kids to see this movie, I should remind you that it is rated R for a very good reason.  The violence is brutally realistic when Jesus is scourged.  When it's all done, there appear to be hundreds of bloody lacerations all over his body.  And on top of this there is of course the crown of thorns and being nailed to the cross.I would be remiss in my review if I did not say something about the anti-Semitism that supposedly exists in this film. There are a couple of problems with this charge.  One, it was by far the Roman gentiles-not the Jews-who were the most vicious, sardonic and sadistic people in the movie.Second there is the crucial question: were the Jews portrayed in a negative light?  An oversimplified ""yes"" would hardly do the matter justice.  Yes, some Jews were-but many were not.  By mentioning only the instances of a negative portrayal of Jews, some critics make the movie seem a lot more one-sided than it really is.So what are the favorable portrayals of Jews?  There is of course the fact that the protagonist and his most loyal followers were Jewish (a fact often overlooked by Anti-Semites who call themselves Christians).  The Jewishness of the women followers was particularly emphasized with some brief Passover dialogue.  Additionally, Mel Gibson went ""out of his way"" (included material not in the gospels) to show that these Jewish enemies of Jesus were not representative of all Jews.  For instance, the movie showed a dissenting member of the Sanhedrin.  ""Who called the meeting anyway?  And at this hour of the night?  Where are the other members of the council?""  As the crowd pushed him out of the meeting, the Jewish priest denounced the whole meeting as a ""beastly travesty!""  Furthermore, the movie made it most explicitly clear that Simon of Cyrene was a Jew, and he was ultimately seen as a compassionate man, very sympathetic towards the suffering of Jesus.  This Jewish man who was not a follower of Jesus was actually more virtuous than any of the gentiles in the movie.Any unfavorable aspects of the DVD?  Unfortunately, yes.  Probably the most disappointing aspect of this DVD is the complete lack of any special features.  On the main menu, there are only the options of playing the film in addition to the language and scene selections.  (Though there is a nice feature for the visually impaired.)  Granted, given the seriousness of the matter, humorous outtakes might not have been appropriate.  But even still, something like a little director commentary would have been nice.  Overall however, this is still a DVD that one should have if one wants a reasonably comprehensive video library.  The movie will likely be remembered and watched several generations long after we're dead."	4.0	One of the best movies on the life of Christ	2004-09-01	4	4	0

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	The Jewish PEOPLE were no more responsible for the death of Christ than the German PEOPLE were for the death of millions of Jews during World War II. On the contrary, it was the Jewish LEADERS that killed Christ, as it was the German LEADERS that killed the Jews - and both out of envy. If Christ had been born in Ireland or some other country, it would have been their leaders that killed Him. WHO killed Christ is unimportant.What is important is WHY Christ died. He wasn't murdered - He gave up His own life willingly as part of God's plan for saving His people from their sins. If you watch The Passion and all you see is brutality, blood and death, you're missing the point. The point is, without Christ's sacrifice, we would all die in our sins and spend the rest of eternity separated from God, because none of us is good enough to save himself. But God, out of love, took on Himself our sins in the person of Christ. We were the ones scheduled to be brutally beaten and die on that cross; but God, out of love, took the punishment for us and died in our place. He did what we couldn't do for ourselves. And then He did one more thing: He raised Himself from the dead, proving for all time that He indeed was God; and showing that, one day, we, too, would rise again.The Passion Of The Christ shows the sacrifice that Christ made for us, which only love could have compelled Him to do. The brutality only underscores His love. If you don't watch The Passion and see the love behind it, you're missing the point; and, possibly, missing the boat as far as what Christ came to bring.Christ was born to die. He wasn't born to teach, heal or show the way: He IS the Way. He was born to die - not pointlessly, but purposefully, so that we could live. THAT's what The Passion is all about: not brutality, blood and death; but love, sacrifice and life. If you see that when you watch this movie, it's only because God has given you the eyes to see it, as well as the gift to share in what Christ came to bring.Waitsel Smith	5.0	A PRODUCT OF LOVE, SKILL AND MARKETING GENIUS	2006-01-13	14	9	5
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2HT583U2R277S	wakeride74	Opinions and understandings of the movie and its message have been somewhat mixed and very controversial. Instead of trying to argue what faith is right, who understands the gospel the best, and how accurate the movie is let's get to the bottom line. The movie has been an over all good thing for a country like ours that is increasingly tolerant of everything but discipline and Christian morality. The movie has inspired people to renew their commitment to God, read and re-read the gospel. It has burned disturbing images into our brains to remind us of his love, what was endured, and what was given for our salvation. Read and interpret the bible according to your understanding of our Lord. God bless Mel Gibson for helping so many move towards a first look, new look, or just another look at the good book and the message of love from Christ our Lord.	5.0	The Bottom Line	2004-08-19	8	2	6

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A9S7HNDRRNIXS	Walter B. Harriman Jr.	I was so disappointed with this film.  I can't believe so many people were fans of this movie.  Let's argue logcially here.  Reviews of this film should not be based on whether the reviewer is religious or not.  Reviews should focus on this particular film and what kind of a job it does (or doesn't do) in conveying a message.  So, we all get the message loud and clear that Jesus died a brutal death.  They could have summed this up in 5 or 10 minutes (instead of 127 minutes), then focused on what was behind the death and what might have been learned afterwards.  This was a pathetic attempt, with no apparent message behind the carnage.  Is this really what our public craves now: mindless violence?  Do we not have any interest in exploring and debating such brutality?  Why not challenge the audience to question history and question themselves in how they react to these powerful images?  There was nothing to think about or discuss after this film.  Doesn't this seem short sighted with such an important topic?  Doesn't this underestimate the audience and their mental capacities?  I'm afraid for this country if it is me that is overestimating the mind power of those in the audience.  Lets compare this graphic imagery with the torture scenes at the end of Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  In my opinion, the violent scenes in Braveheart served more of a purpose.  We already had an intimate understanding of what William Wallace had been through, and the cause for which he was willing to die.  Therefore, we question whether we could relate to the courage he demonstrates and what we might do in his situation.  We are flooded with emotion and respect for his taking a stand and willingness to sacrifice his life for the cause of freedom and fight against oppression.  Don't you think the makers of Passion could have explored different avenues to make us think?  What a disappointment.	1.0	truly a disappointment/an underestimation of the audience	2005-04-30	55	27	28
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2KU5PG32H7QBN	"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic"""	I watched 'The Passion of the Christ,' and as the credits rolled, I was incredibly surprised, not to mention overwhelmed. There were flaws; most films during the year often have them. But I must say, although I understand where most were coming from when hating this film, I'm still quite shocked there were so many that accused director Mel Gibson of producing an &quot;artistic failure&quot; or a movie full of anti-semitism. Read what Roger Ebert wrote here, and you'll see why I didn't throw similar accusations at Gibson or his film.&quot;A reasonable person, I believe, will reflect that in this story set in a Jewish land, there are many characters with many motives, some good, some not, each one representing himself, none representing his religion. The story involves a Jew who tried no less than to replace the established religion and set himself up as the Messiah. He was understandably greeted with a jaundiced eye by the Jewish establishment while at the same time finding his support, his disciples and the founders of his church entirely among his fellow Jews. The libel that the Jews &quot;killed Christ&quot; involves a willful misreading of testament and teaching: Jesus was made man and came to Earth in order to suffer and die in reparation for our sins. No race, no man, no priest, no governor, no executioner killed Jesus; he died by God's will to fulfill his purpose, and with our sins we all killed him. That some Christian churches have historically been guilty of the sin of anti-Semitism is undeniable, but in committing it they violated their own beliefs.&quot;I agree that Christians believe Christ died because it was part of God's plan. And according to the Bible, the Jews were not responsible, nor were the Romans: it was the collective sin in the world in past, present and future. It says it in the Bible, and that's what most, if not all, Christians believe. If a Christian were to hate someone of Hebrew descent or of the Jewish religion, they would be, like Ebert said, violating their own belief system.Despite some wonderful cinematic aspects of the film, great acting and obvious emotional power, I truly believe Gibson failed in attempting to make 'The Passion' universal. Sometimes, there was a bit too much violence. I really wished he hadn't focused on the beating as much as the beautifully filmed flashbacks, which could have given people who were unfamiliar with the subject matter a better understanding of why there was a purpose for this violence, and why there was so much of it, and why Jesus was so fiercely accused of blasphomy, the politics, etc. It would have continued to illuminate His influence on His people and family, as well.Although the violence is disappointingly distracting from the overall messege, I do not hesitate to call it a work of art; technically, it is perfect. Also, a film that caused as much conversation about world issues as it did, well, it can't be thrown away as a failure or unimportant, in my eyes. It was not pornographic, either. Its violence served a purpose, and I think Gibson followed through with what he was trying to convey with what I think is one of the better films of the year. I was nearly brought to tears countless times. This is not to be missed. You may hate it, you may be on the fence, or you may love it, but there is no doubt that this is the most unavoidably visceral work in cinema since Lars von Trier's 'Dancer in the Dark.'	4.0	One of the stronger films of the year.	2004-08-04	15	6	9

It seems to revel in the portrayal of gore, viloence, and human suffering while almost consciously avoiding the relevance of Jesus' teachings.The movie is so quick to get to seeing Jesus in pain that it can't be bothered with the Last Supper. I can't believe people found any value in this film. It's as if the Director wished only to employ every modern film-making technique available to assail the viewer with graphic scenes of violence and torment. The actual teachings of Jesus take less than second-seat to the need for the film to portray inventive ways of torturing Jesus.I found a recent viewing of Jesus of Nazareth to be an act of artistic genius compared to this travesty. At least that film attempted to convey some meaningful message to the viewer other than ""glad that didn't happen to me"". The Passion is an astrocious film and I can't see it making any meaningful contribution other than showing how badly a Actor turned Director can go astray.

I jadedly felt like I'd seen it all before (except for the blood, which, however, was nowhere near as gruesome as some critics would have you believe).Jim Caviezel was a pedestrian Jesus, while Monica Belucci was thoroughly forgettable as Magadalene. Only Maia Morgenstern was memorable (as Mary). She brought a touching pathos to her role.I searched hard for anti-Semitism and found none whatsoever. I also searched for a protagonist that I cared about. Sorry, but just because the movie is about Jesus, that doesn't give Mel a free pass to create a character completely detached from the viewer. Remember: this is a still just a movie. I found myself not really caring about the suffering, as no character development had been done leading up to that point.For a far more affecting look at the life of Jesus, see Scorcese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""(Finally, on a purely theological note, I fail to see the great ""sacrifice"" made by Jesus. If I knew that I was going to sit in judgement of all mankind at God's right hand, I would let them pummel me for a month. How is it a sacrifice if you're trading earthly existence for paradise?

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2LNI8W2FO0C2L	Westexed	Having read all the hype, I was surprised when I saw the DVD.  The movie was not excessively violent; it simply realistically portrayed torture and a crucifixion which are very violent events.I was also surprised at the correlations between what was happening in historical times in the movie and what is happening in the present day Middle East.  I spent some years in Saudi Arabia.  Every Friday, they have public executions (beheadings) that are just as violent and gory as what is shown in this movie; beheadings are just a little less time consuming and costly than a crucifixion.  And, family members clean up the mess just as Mary and Mary Magdalene do in the movie.  Also, consider the present day suicide bombers; that's pretty violent.  And, let's not forget about killing a couple hundred kids in a school as happened this week in a predominantly Muslim part of the former Soviet Union; that's also pretty violent.  Public executions, torture, and suicide bombings are intended to send a message to the observer.So, after seeing the movie, I think Mel may have had more in mind than a history lesson; I think he is also trying to give us a message about the present and the future.  If you want to see real extreme violence take a look at the present day Middle East.One final comment:  In the DVD setup section, you can turn on a scene by scene description of the movie intended to aid the visually impaired.  It points out a lot of minor, but interesting, parts of the movie that you may miss otherwise.	5.0	Not Just Mel's Version Of A Historical Event	2004-09-04	13	10	3

Greenwood ""PorterW"""	I just viewed this movie last weekend, and finally I get to see a better portrayal of the religious story.I understand that Jesus in the stories is beaten and scourged before his crucifixtion, so there has to be a movie where we get to view Jesus finally experiencing pain.  Of all the films that have been made on the passion, this one is the most accurate, but still not perfect.What's wrong with it?  How about the retarded little things Mel Gibson inserts, like the devil, or small children chasing Judas Iscariot.  What a fluke, I laughed my butt off at that part. Just stick to the official stories of the bible there Mel.  Your just proving that religion is worthless and can be rewritten as stories just like that.  Also the dropping of Jesus off a bridge was funny.One last thing I'd like to point out is the terrible scourging of Jesus.  At first it was believable, but after they used those inch and a half hook whips that dug into the table, but still only managed to rip Jesus' skin off after about 70 or so whipings was absolutly mental.  I know for a fact with those whips, they would've ripped all his flesh on his back right off the bone.  Terrible terrible, it would've killed him.  But still, he manges to stand up and carry, probably more than 100 pound big piece of wood, WHILE enduring more whippings, beatings, nails in his hands and feet AND without any hydration.*rolls eyes*Did I mention Jesus is still a white man from the Middle East?  *cough*Watch this for its take on the STORIES in the bible written by men, not for historical content.	2.0	Best film to date, but TERRIBLY overblown.	2005-03-25	28	6	22
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1ZDHB0R9A6LMK	Whiteseagull	Sometimes one has to step back and see a film for what it is. Mel Gibson's whole career and success in life is based on violence in the cinema, from Mad Max to Braveheart, so it's not surprising that when searching for another film to direct he chose a most violent thing; a crucifixion. But shockingly, this is violence that strikes at the heart of a faith.Violence is not the faith. The faith is about a celebration of life; in the teachings of a living prophet (or living God, as the Christians called him) who gave us intelligent words of wisdom, peace, hope for all and self worth as living, spiritual beings.For me, The Passion of Christ misses the point of spirituality. I simply fell into the emotion of feeling sorry for this good man being beaten to a pulp and humiliated before us. As this film is from Jesus' point-of-view, there could have been some truly intimate scenes between him and his God, which would have completed the experience and made this a better film.What Mr. Gibson has made here is an audience attracting, sensationalist film. A spectacle of blood filled with gore and gratuitous violence. What it lacks is sensitivity and nuance. In film nothing is real, it is all made up with 110 page scripts, actors in make-up, cameras, backdrops with painted studio floors and fake blood. It is totally the subjective opinion of the filmmaker no matter how artificial or real it seems, and the audience is entirely at the whim of that filmmaker. I was left with the feeling of being manipulated by a disturbed filmmaker.This is an exploitation film shamelessly praying on the hearts and minds of the followers of a faith, with a distorted touch of scary film shock to sell tickets and reap the currency of the faithful, the curious and the perverse who enjoy violence. This is like turning the sanctity of the faithful into a World Wrestling Federation Circus.To me, Mr. Gibson hasn't yet risen to the challenge of being a storyteller. But unfortunately, he garners the attendance at this movie because it is masquerading as a biblical epic made by a matinee idol.Great photography of Filmmaker/Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel. Wonderful emotional music of John Debney. Fine editing of John Wright and production design of Francesco Frigeri. Great acting of Jim Caviezel. All together a great cast and crew members who made this film for Mr. Gibson.One thing this film did for me was to make me think, think about all the atrocities that man has done to fellow man throughout the ages in the name of Jesus Christ by the very people who preach his words. Fortunately for us, the good message seeps through and survives. Jesus' life was neither about death, torture nor tyranny, but about the simple celebration of spiritual love, growth, life and how to get along with our fellow human beings.

The only ones who are complaining that this film is anti Semitic are those who haven`t seen it and are just trying to think up an excuse to make a christian film look bad. Jesus even said people will hate you because of me and be persecuted so this is nothing new. As for the film it self, it was a moving experience. This film is not entertainment but shows the love the Jesus had to die on the cross to pay for our sins. John 3:16 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Many people think you have to do good works to get to heaven but the bible says all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god. So there is no hope there and that is why Jesus died as portrayed in the passion to become a sacrifice for us so our sins will be paid for and that if we believe this and make him Lord of our life we can get to heaven!!! The movie will be even more emotional knowing all this. But of course without his resurrection (which was very well done in the film) we would not have had our ultimate proof that he is God. I think everyone should see this movie and think about this. It was hard to watch but I`m glad I went.	5.0	Christ died for our sins.	2004-03-14	3	1	2

Gibson took a big chance with his career by making such a film, But I do not believe anyone could come as close to the real thing as He did.We sometimes forget what happened on the Cross that day.

Yes, it might reflect the heartlessness of mankind and the violence people are capable of, But it did not at all reflect the person of Jesus or bring him any closer to the audience. The stereotyped and absolutely female looking ""satan"" was just ridiculous and typical fundamentalisic. The cinematography and the acting was okay, but what did Gibson want to tell us with this fundamentalistic waste of celluloid? That we are cruel and nothing changed until today? Yes, look into Iraq, China and other Countries, and we know! The Message of Jesus is a Message of Love, Unity, Forgiveness and Tolerance. Something most of his followers have forgotten, praying hate and other horrible things. Now it would be time for a movie that shows all the blood that was spilled in his name. It is sad, that a movie that just projects violence and gore was such a big success in the United States and it shows the hunger for sensations and scandal. And I dont think that Jesus would like that movie at all.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3FZGQPFOESL7J	Wil	"Some say its the greatest story ever told. And I am inclined to believe them. And Mel Gibson takes the final 12 hours of that amazing story, that amazing life, and puts it under a cinematic microscope the likes of which Christians have never known. The Passion is a well made, well directed and well acted film. It is sure to rank among the best ever made in the genre. But it does have its problems.First, I couldn't help but feel that Gibson was leaning too heavily on traditional and/or personal teachings and understandings of certain aspects of this story rather than on the scriptures themselves. He seems to go above and beyond the scriptures in many cases, and not just to preserve a sense of realism or artistic vision.For example, as in many films on the life of Christ, his mother Mary is given a spotlight almost as large as the Lord's. In scripture, Mary certainly is there, but she is never as central to the Gospels as, say, Peter.Secondly, I have a hard time believing the Romans beat Christ as many times as they did. There is no evidence in the scriptures to suggest that Christ was beat to a higher degree than any other ""criminal"" being prepared for crucifixion. This is the scene that I believe that many point to as being over-the-top and violent for violence sake. I can't help but agree. Forty lashes was the usual punishment (I think) and yet we get almost double that here.Then there is the scene when Jesus is brought before Herod and he asks Jesus to perform a miracle for him. Why is Herod being portrayed as some sort of flamboyant cream puff? Maybe historical documents prove otherwise but in all my studies of the scriptures I have never heard that.Next are the historical inaccuracies. The Romans would have spoken Greek not Latin. Crucifixion was in the wrists not the hands (the hands were not strong enough to hold the body in place).Other non Biblical scenes include Jesus hanging from chains over a bridge by his Roman tormentors and also being flipped over face down with the cross crushing him against the ground as they secure the nails to the beams. All the while, blood is everywhere, flying, dripping, seeping.As for the package itself, I was really hoping for extras, but you get nothing at all. This was a real disappointment, as I always enjoy those sorts of things with DVDs.On the bright side, however, as was alluded to before, the acting is great, especially the performance of Jim Caviezel as Jesus. Never before has a more believable Christ been committed to film.Don't think that I totally dislike this film. It is a good film. But I think Gibson may have allowed many of his own passions and personal beliefs to color the telling of the story. But ultimately, although powerful and compelling to behold, it falls short of the glory it could have attained, numbing viewers instead of humbling them."	3.0	The Gospel According To Mel	2005-03-15	10	3	7
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1BS8YM712C0VJ	Will Culp	"With a box office total of about 200 million dollars at its 2nd week, The Passion is shaping up to be a box office hit of momentious perportions. Telling the story of Jesus' last 12 hours, from the Gardens of Gesthamane to his blink of an eye ressurection, this movie imbeds the message of Christianity as powerfully as the nails that punctured Christ. By the end of the movie, almost everybody was in tears and was moved beyond comparison. My own father had to ""Depressure"" for about an hour to get all the sadness of this movie out of his system. I praise Mel Gibson for never giving up for what he believed in or caving in to controversy, because this is the most vivid and accurate account of The Last 12 Hours of Christ that has been potrayed to this day.Acting: The acting throughout this movie is top-notch even though it was cast in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, so you have to rely on English subtitles to translate the words. The acting is dark, and the actors voices make your heart beat faster every time they talk. Jim Caviezel is the perfect choice for Jesus, as his voice seems to stand out from all the others, but towards the end he just grunts and doesn't do all that much, but thats forgiveable. The standout in acting in my opinion came from Maia Morgenstern, who plays the brooding and grief-stricken Mary, who follows Jesus on his path to the cross and is by him until he utters his last words to her. Monica Belluci and whoever plays James play great supporting roles and really added to the movie. Also I love how the Devil follows Jesus to the cross and the scene where she is holding the Anti-Christ is one of the most memorable.Directing: Mel Gibson does an absolutely excellent job directing,as he pours his heart out into this movie. The way he casts a gloomy atmosphere over the movie will make most critics swoon. I loved the camera work(Especially the slow-mo shots) and I thought that I really was in Jerusalem 2000 years ago with the vivid images that you see. Excellent! Mel Gibson will probably get at LEAST nominated for an Academy Award by the end of this year.Bottom Line: This is an epic motion picture that should be seen by all Christians and anybody trying to get into the religion. Do not listen to the liberals who call this movie Anti-Semitic, it just potrays what is written in the Gospels. I would not recommend this to anyone under 8, as I think most kids over that age could handle the gore(They might even learn a little latin)Footnotes: This movie has a great score and I recommend the sountrack that was realeased at the time of the movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A22TRZC8HTRSRU	"William Alexander ""Alexander, Shaun"""	"I have never been a Mel Gibson fan, either as an actor or a director, although he has a wonderful eye for panorama and the use of lush color in his movies.  But, since I enjoyed ""Apocalypto"" in spite of its problems (which any film painting on such a large canvas is likely to have), I finally decided to watch this much-hyped film.  I was appalled.The story of the Passion is relatively brief, but powerful, whether or not you accept its literal truth.  This film reduced its potency to an orgy of sado-masochistic exhibitionism with anti-Semitic embellishments.  ""Jews"" are depicted as a faceless, howling mob lusting for sacred blood, some going so far to visit the site of the execution to gloat like comic-opera villains, something Jews of the time would have never done, places of execution being ritually unclean.  Further, the ""Satan"" of the Gesthemane scene was equally problematic, a malevolent, androgyne cross between Klaus Nomi and Udo Kier.  Gibson clearly sets his fey and urbane devil against the ""muscular"" Christ in what I thought was yet another Gibson indulgence of the tired, emasculated ""homosexual evil"" construct. Never mind that Satan, in the actual Passion story, never puts in an appearance.  And these are fairly representative problems in what is, essentially, a two-hour long snuff film where the ""Sermon on the Mount"" is reduced to one line, swallowed up by loving, gratuitous shots of Roman punishments and execution methods.  Indeed, if the movie has any value, it lies in a faithful reproduction of how Romans treated people who ran afoul of their rule.  But as is, it takes the clear prejudices of the film-maker, slathers them with gore, and lays them on the flayed back of the unimpressive Jim Caveziel who - I hope - was very well paid for his efforts, at least.If this is a subject that interests you, I would recommend ""The Greatest Story Ever Told.""  True, it is very long and can get very dry, but at least it tries to be as comprehensive as the historical record allows, and you actually hear the words of Christ as opposed to his shrieks.  But the only ""Passion"" in this film has less to do with Christ than the turgid, dripping, dark obssessions of its maker.No recommendation."	1.0	The Abattoir of the Christ	2010-07-21	13	4	9
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	ABFJ2AOD8YVJP	"William A. Mason III ""RR"""	"In this amazing and compelling account of the last hours of the life of Christ, Mel Gibson appeals to viewers on an emotional level by portraying the horrors, the Son of God went through on behalf of mankind. His intense realistic effects keep viewers bearing enough pain without leaving their seats, in order to get across the real repose the Savior of the world suffered. Staring James Caviezel as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern, (Mary), and Monica Belluci, (Mary Magdalen), it's based on the four gospels; mainly out of the book of John. It portrays Jesus, on the road to crucifixion, being beaten and whipped by roman soldiers, only to have a crown of thorns put on his head and be lead away by Pontius Pilot, to be put to death by Roman justice. It then flashes back to earlier times in the Carpenter's life as he journeys toward the actual agony of hanging on the cross, such as the ""Sermon on the Mount."" The movie is in the original Hebrew language with English subtitles; but doesn't take away from the intensity. A person would no doubt stay alert at this drastic film of an event that will leave a lasting mark, or at least make them feel more compassionate about the passion of the Christ."	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	2004-12-01	7	3	4

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A5ZBKEG5ZCBE5	William Catts	"No one will enjoy this movie, but everyone should experience it.  It is an extremely graphic depiction of an act of extreme love.  Many negative reviews of this film are based on a lack of understanding and proper context.  Before Christ, Creator God required His people to present animal blood sacrifices to be pardoned from their sins and avoid eternal spiritual death.  God, who is holy, cannot tolerate sin in His presence, yet the Bible says that every person has sinned, and that our best efforts at ""being a good person"" are like filthy rags before God.  God loved us so much that He determined to provide a way for us to spend eternity in His presence even though we could not earn this treasure on our own.  Jesus is that way.  Jesus, who is God, became man on this earth.  Born of Mary, He experienced all of the trials and temptations that we face, yet, being fully God, He was able to live blamelessly - without sin.  Because He was perfect, Jesus was worthy to become the once-and-for-all sacrifice for our sins.  His death forever paid the penalty for sin for anyone who accepts Him.  His blood washes us clean so that we can stand before God.  His resurrection gives us the hope of eternal life with God.  That is what this films depicts - extreme, perfect, eternal love.  If Jesus was willing to endure what He did for us, how can we not love and serve Him?As for the charges of anti-Semetism, they are again based on a misunderstanding of the truth of the gospel story.  The actions of the characters and crowds in The Passion are consistent with what is recorded in the Bible.  Anyone who is skeptical of that comment need only read the last few chapters of Matthew, Mark, Luke and/or John for themselves.  The point of the gospel story though, is that we are ALL responsible for Jesus' crucifixion.  He laid down His life for each of us, because our sin made it necessary.  As horrific as it was, Christ's death was part of God's loving plan of salvation for us.  The Jews did not kill Jesus.  The Romans did not kill Jesus.  Jesus laid down His life in love because each of us are sinful."	5.0	A primal experience	2004-03-02	6	4	2

It focusses on the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ and nothing can quite prepare you for the amount of gore shown.  It is apparently 100% factual, but do we really need to be shown so much torture on screen - it simply went on and on and on.  It was so graphic that we all had to keep looking away.  There is more blood than you will ever see in a horror film.  But it doesn't end there.  Whiel carrying the crucifix, we are subjected to the beatings that Jesus received along the way.  There is a difference between implying it, and showing it.  I just felt that Mel Gibson went for the shock angle, and subjected us all to far too much gore.  Factual or not, there is no need for so much gore on a screen.  This is not how Jesus would want to be remembered.	3.0	Unnecessay amount of gore	2004-04-23	29	9	20

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A27UH9ZPW41B9N	William Spencer	Mel Gibson, in his 2004 film The Passion of the Christ, gave the world a document that was truly an act of Catholic worship. The film, laced with modern sensibilities and Catholic mystic dogma, allowed the viewers to meditate on the suffering by Jesus for the propitiation of our sins. Although, the film&#8217;s delivery is obviously a product of the 21 century, the socio-political milieus of these events are quite accurately portrayed.From the gospel record of Jesus&#8217; trial before the Sanhedrin we find that Mel Gibson was accurate in showing the contradictory nature of the accusing witnesses. This seems to be by far the most accurate scene in the film. The desire of the council was to produce witnesses who would give testimony with enough evidence to condemn Jesus to death. However, the witnesses produced contradictory testimony. (Stein, 1996) As in the film, the evidence did not come forth through the witnesses but by Jesus Himself, when Jesus answered Caiaphas in the affirmative about being the Son of God, the Messiah.The film&#8217;s portrayal of Herod is very reminiscent of John Belushi&#8217;s role in the movie Animal House. Herod is portrayed in a frat boy manner obsessed with seeing a stage show of miracles. Herod made a joke out of his examination of Jesus through mockery. (Summers, 1965)  Yet, it would be interesting to know if Herod was truly the clown portrayed in the film. Herod was not interested in the claims of Jesus or His message. Herod wanted to see the miracle worker in action. It is obvious that Herod was not up to the task of an actual serious examination of Jesus or of truly considering the charges being sworn against Him. Herod did not appear interested in anything other than a stage show performed by the famous miracle worker. Herod did not find fault in Jesus. Yet, he did not seriously consider Him either. He is an example of many who have missed out on the truly important things in life by focusing on the temporal.Mel Gibson&#8217;s film portrayed Pilate as a cowardly individual who feared the outcome of a possible rebellion. Pilate in the film tries to find a way to free Jesus from execution but in the end gives in to the Jewish crowd. The gospel records are in line with the depiction of the film. Pilate saw no wrong in Jesus, certainly not anything worthy of death. Yet, with the crowd in such an excited state, calling for Jesus&#8217; death, Pilate certainly was boxed in a corner. It is possible as depicted in the film that Cesar would have moved against Pilate in the case of a rebellion. Pilate&#8217;s principles of justice then gave away to self-preservation.The film The Passion of the Christ portrayed accurately the socio-political milieu surrounding the trial and death of Jesus the Messiah. It portrayed the Jewish leaders grasping at anything to condemn Jesus to death. It depicted the none seriousness of Herod when Jesus was brought before him for inspection, and it accurately showed Pilate as a man more concerned with quelling a mob than pursuing true justice.	4.0	The Passion of The Christ	2014-01-09	2	2	0

The pacing is pitch perfect, and the acting is spot on and enthralling. The Passion of the Christ does not contain a single hokey scene in which I questioned the actor's ability. Instead, the story is immersive. Regardless of how you feel about world religions, see the movie and enjoy it as a well acted and directed story.There are so many bad Hollywood products being turned out that if you want a well made film, please consider the Passion of the Christ. If you rent it merely looking to strengthen your polemic, well...can't help you there. I have enjoyed almost every recent project that Mel Gibson has been involved with.

The truth is that Jesus' name has been used by Christians to extort and bribe and convert millions across the globe against their will. Think about it! What better way to get someone to convert to Christianity than to promise them eternal salvation in the after-life if they simply convert to Christianity and accept the teachings of the fictional character of Jesus at face value. These impoverished souls in the Third World are being basically bribed to join the Christian cult, and this particular cult thrives off of films like ""The Passion"" as propaganda tools in order to achieve their goals. Jesus never existed in a historical sense; he was invented by the powers within the Church in order to promote Christianity. Thus, Christianity used Jesus as a marketing tool in order to convince the masses (most of whom were not well-read at the time). Films like Gibson's promote this type of fiction and perpetrates this desire for conversion of those who don't believe in Jesus. Fortunately, people are starting to wake up (there is an increase in anti-missionary work) and realize that the Church has been brainwashing them and has been using fictional Jesus to promote a conservative right-wing agenda."	1.0	This movie is pure (bad) fiction....	2005-03-04	23	7	16

It's too bad, because the picture it gives is deeply rooted in history - unless, of course, you believe that the New Testament accounts are fairy tales with no basis in history.  If so, you may have no interest.  But the dramatic power of the story and the historical accuracy with which it is presented have a power of their own, no matter what you believe.It is interesting that this movie was attacked for its anti-Semitism.  To a person with no axe to grind either way, it would seem that if Jesus was NOT the Messiah, then indeed he was a blasphemer and a troublemaker par excellence, and the Jewish hierarchy were doing the right thing to get rid of him.  If he was the Messiah, then this same hierarchy was playing a dangerous game, and the earthquakes and general destruction that followed his death were a sign that perhaps his kingdom truly was not of this world...and not a rational thing, either.The hierarchs who fuel the cry for his crucifixion are above all rational men, who see where their power lies, and know how to maintain it.  There are several of the hierarchy who disagree, but they are shouted down.  All along, there are those on both sides (Romans and Jews) whose hearts are moved, and who are horrified by the brutality of what happens.  So it certainly cannot be said that the Jews en masse are to be blamed, as was wrongly said by many ignorant people in the Church during medieval times and later, who used this as an excuse to persecute Jesus' people.If Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, they know not what they do,"" then it is indeed the Christians who have failed to follow Jesus' example.  The true guilt lies here.  Each of us during Holy Week should watch this movie and see what the results of lack of forgiveness are.  Teachings of forgiveness and mercy are not unique to the New Testament, they are there in the Torah/Pentateuch if one's eyes are open.  The Jewish people who went like lambs to the slaughter of the Holocaust are heirs of Jesus, even if they did not believe in his identity as the Messiah.  And we Christians have been in the shoes of the Romans who drove in the nails.If hearts are open to it, this movie could bring much peace to the world.  Peace is never brought by ignoring violence but by confronting, even, if necessary, submitting to it, and forgiving it - which is the only thing, ultimately, that touches men's hearts."	5.0	Father, forgive us...	2010-04-02	4	2	2

Smith ""True Believer"""	"THE PASSION0 Stars!The Amazon synopsis is typical PR for this sadly, fearful and ugly film: Salute Mel Gibson for his bravery and integrity in putting his own cash and career on the line for his beliefs. It's fine to admire a determined director. Unfortunately, it's not a valid review of his film.Despite the many objections to the Passion's sado-masochistic heavy-handedness, what is most reprehensible about the film is Gibson & Company's insistence on the reality - indeed, the divine nature - of its creation. However, there is very little biblical textual reality to Gibson's rendition, certainly very little of what we Catholics and Christians call ""The Word.""The screenplay - by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald - takes rash liberties with all New Testament texts and adds its own sound bite relish. Much is owed to contemporary interpretation. Throughout, Jesus insists on his own divinity. Throughout, Mary is the dutiful mother figure cleaning up after her son, the Apostles are speechless weaklings, the Pharisees conniving Shylocks, the Romans giddy sadists. And throughout, an androgynous devil figure watches on with B-movie eyes of glee. No wonder Gibson did not originally want his film sullied with sub-titles - he didn't want his audience to see the obvious chinks in the armor of his allegedly ""historically accurate"" creation.He needn't have feared. Contrary to the tidal wave of pre-opening press declaring its uniqueness (it's subititled!), the film panders to contemporary society's adolescent worship and glorification of violence - and, therefore, fits right in with today's Hollywood historical offerings such as Gibson's ""Braveheart"" and Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator."" The abhorrent violence - again, so briefly sketched in the Gospels - is here relentless, splashed across the screen in slow motion, stop-time, close-up ""Braveheart"" lengths. Jesus is flogged like a tenderized sirloin. His pierced side produces a fountain that waters the crowd. (I checked my Home Medical Manual to verify that, indeed, human beings only have 10 pints of blood to spill). It's voyeurism at its absolute worst.Finally, the saddest impression one takes from Gibson's film is that Jesus was tortured and died. Is that why his impact on mankind has been so great? There is little allusion to His teachings - a few token flashbacks of Jesus ""on message"" with his followers - but these moments lack any charismatic significance or volition to the story's plot. What finally resonates in Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is the fear and cruelty of man. And that's exactly what Jesus' life so beautifully transcended.You would never know that by viewing this film."	1.0	A hateful, ignorant film	2004-11-11	71	35	36

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A1P6NRWDD1NT4B	"Yendor ""sknayfan"""	"After films like THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, KING OF KINGS, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, and tv miniseries such as JESUS OF NAZARETH and the recent JESUS MINI SERIES(CBS), and endless documentaries on the life of Jesus Christ on the HISTORY CHANNEL, PBS, and TLC etc., etc. (even Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN can be put into the mix) one would think that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST would be a hard sell. Mel Gibson's vision could be viewed as extreme and in some cases unwatchable. The debate(s) in the film are endless as Christianity stresses that Jesus Christ ""suffered"" for our sins. However, was his suffering this extreme?  Only the people who who were present could only know. Yet, if one studied the brutality of the Romans as they put on feats of carnage at the Coliseum, one could argue that the same brutality was shed at crucifixions (pre and during).  The other debate is the question of anti-semitism.  No! this film does not promote anti-semitism.  However, it was the Jewish Rabbis and clergymen who forced the Romans and egged-on their 'people' to have Jesus Christ killed because they felt threatened. Lastly, the success of the film is probably due to the timing of its release.  Every once in a while, a reaffirmation of faith is needed by the population and perhaps a serious religious film such as 'THE PASSION...' was needed.  There hasn't been a major release of this type of film in a while and with a slew of recent films concerning the supernatural, demonic, and witchcraft etc. Mel Gibson grabbed his opportunity and the film took on a life of its own. Because of this film, it is now reported that the Bible is being looked at as a new source of ideas for films (Are there Bible related or religious comic books out there?).  The entertainment value of the film is dabatable but it is provoking and it does, to a degree, reaffirm one's faith and to remind one what Christianity is all about."	4.0	The Passion of Mel Gibson	2004-11-17	3	2	1

Finally, a new way to guilt trip and sensationalize people into becoming Christian! My gripes have less to do with the production and direction of the film (which is quite good) as the actual content and message.This film has little or nothing to do with Christ's message or purpose in life. I highly doubt he would get much satisfaction knowing that people blatantly ignored all of his good works and preaching over the years, simply to use his incredibly painful  death to ostracize, dehumanize and conrol other human beings into modern days. With that, let's talk about anti-Semitism: this film is far from anti-Semitic, and the Christians who glorify in it have made it so. So a group of Jews got together and condemned one man to death. If there was to be a film made about all of the atrocities Christians have commited in the name of Jesus over the years, it would finish well over any standard running time. Not only that, but most of the people killed in Jesus' name didn't do anything - at least the Pharisees had reason to fear rebellion. Christians have repayed their savior's death many, many times over.In conclusion, I was disgusted by the way Gibson chose to exploit Christ's death. Whether he felt he was doing something pious is irrelevant.	1.0	Sick, sad, and un-Christian.	2004-10-06	48	23	25

That all changes with ""The Passion of the Christ"".I don't want to get into the nit-picking of this film, as in all honesty I do not have a strong scriptural grasp on all the passages that director Mel Gibson tries to portray, but instead I view it from just one perspective: Beginning with the night that Jesus was taken into Roman custody until the stone was rolled away from the tomb, this film is a very visceral interpretation of one possible scenario that may have played out.  It is sort of like a ""historical-fiction"" telling of the crucifixion story, as no one knows exactly what transpired.From a plot perspective, the film doesn't at all delve into the meaning of Jesus' crucifixion (to save the world from their sins so we can join him in heaven someday), but takes a ""just the facts, m'am"" approach to the story.  Jesus is captured by the Romans, tried by King Herod and Pontius Pilate, beaten mercilessly and humiliated, and then crucified...the end.  The violent acts committed during these scenes are startling, to say the least, yet they do shed light on how difficult a process this was for Jesus to endure, as (at the time) he was confined to a mortal body and bound by its limitations.Thus, if you are at all squeamish about bloody violence, steer clear of this film at all costs.  However, if you are a veteran of, say, the ""Saw"" films and would like a more realistic portrayal of the single most important moment in human history, this is your film."	4.0	Will Give You Pause To Think About The Reality Of The Crucifixion	2009-12-14	3	1	2

And of course the directing was great. Mel did add a little with what I thought was the anti-christ when satan was holding that little child. And yes, Jesus did suffer that much.

However, nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.

While I will not rate this movie based on it's obviously Catholic outlook of faith and salvation through suffering, it does need to be said that it is significant in this film.The most disturbing thing to me about Gibson's ""interpretation"" is how liberally and freely Gibson filled in a movie supposedly based on the Gospels with many, many details from ""The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ"" by Anne Catherine Emmerich.  Emmerich was a Catholic nun and stigmatist in the late 18th and early 19th Century who claimed to have had visions of the last 12 hours of Christ's life and wrote them in a book.  The entire text of this can be easily found by doing a search on-line and reading it was very revealing to me.  Gibson took MANY details that weren't in the Gospels and filled them in with Emmerich's visions.  The problem with this being that many of her visions were historically inaccurate.  The most glaring example is the flogging and chastising scene, where Jesus is whipped and flailed what seems like upwards of 70 or 80 times.  The Romans were often cruel and unusual torturers, but they were also very calculated and specific, and this is completely out of line with their practices (which were 40 minus 1 lashes).  This exact scenario, down to the weapons used and the look and state of the guards at hand are taken directly out of Emmerich's book.  Gibson claimed before the movie that he was inspired by her visions, but took little detail from them.  This is blatantly inaccurate, and in reading it, I saw more of her book in the movie than I saw the Gospels.  I understand that purely using the Gospels would've resulted in a movie that may have pushed an hour in length, but the danger lies in believing that everything in this movie is truth, theologically or historically, and that is often far from correct.On a more technical level, I did like the casting of the apostles, especially Peter, but I did feel like Christ should've been cast a bit more ""Jewish"" as he looked a bit too Euro and out of place compared to most of the supporting cast.  It also seemed to me that Christ was willingly going to the Cross out of ""duty"" rather than out of love, both from his expressions and his manner of speaking.  While Christ had His moments of doubt and weakness leading up to his crucifixion, it was always about His love for the human race and I felt like this was often lost.If this movie helps to bolster your faith, then more power to you.  I would also suggest reading the on-line text of Emmerich's book and re-reading the Gospels to truly separate fact from fiction and not accidentally mixing the two out of ignorance.  Also, anyone looking to use this a ""conversion tool"" best look elsewhere.  The release of the movie did get people talking about Christ, which is good, but Gibson is primarily preaching to the choir here.  That is a better starting point than forcing your non-believing friends to watch this."	3.0	Stars for Gibson's convictions but...	2004-08-25	11	9	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A3ADK3ZTJ87915	"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor"""	"At last, we could get tickets. The astoundingly popular new movie in theatres nationwide at the time of this writing, ""The Passion of The Christ"" as directed by Mel Gibson, had sold out in my Midwest town on the first weekend of its showing. While admittedly feeling just a little anxious about seeing onscreen the brutality of a realistic crucifixion-I had heard so much about this aspect of it, and I otherwise avoid movies promoted as violent-I was increasingly eager to see with my own eyes, judge with my own mind, what I was hearing discussed so heatedly everywhere I turned. With record breaking sales, the movie was bringing in unprecedented crowds.I had read and viewed countless interviews and reviews and op-eds about Gibson's portrayal of Christ's crucifixion, heard the talk around the water cooler at the office, shared the insights over dinner with friends, debated the message sent to viewers over a cold one at the pub.And then: the theatre lights dim.The opening scene is blue with moonlight. The shadow of a man in a garden, silhouettes of trees surrounding him, the soft breathing of sleepers nearby. We hear the whisper of anguished prayer, the kind we pray when our hearts are raw with terror and loneliness. Christ prays, alone, to his Father, while his disciples sleep, and for a moment he is more son of man than Son of God, for he feels as we feel, and the sweat runs down his face, lit by the moon, as he trembles with premonition. A silent figure with haunting eyes glimpses between the silhouetted trees, watching, listening. Satan is played by a female figure, male voice dubbed over, androgynous and as oddly seductive in its manner as any evil. This silent figure is always near.It is some time into the movie before I feel the first hot flush of tears wash over my eyes. Perhaps I have been prepared by all the talk. Perhaps I know the story well enough. There are no surprises. If my breathing strains at the merciless scourging, I do not, will not, look away. How can I? It is my hand that holds the whip. It is I who have dealt the punishment. It is I who nevertheless receive the reward of mercy and forgiveness. And so I bear witness.The moment that breaks me down and pushes me over is one that taps into my mother's heart. I watch as Mary's face pales with pain. I watch as she struggles through the crowd massed around to see her son carry His cross, even as the soldiers continue to beat Him. She can do nothing, nothing to stop them, nothing to stop what must be, what her son Himself has accepted fully as the cup that is His to drink. She can, however, let Him see her among that crazed and maddened crowd, let His eyes meet hers for an instant, offering the support of her mother's heart through eyes alone. When her son falls to His knees beneath the terrible weight He carries, Mary recalls instantly the little boy fallen in the dust of the road that runs along their house and how she rushes to Him, embracing him, soothing away His pain. This time, she can't save Him, nor even hold Him, but her eyes send her love to Him across the crowd, and He is strengthened by it.As witness of this scene, one that resonates in me so deeply that I grow dizzy with the pain of empathy and understanding, I allow my own tears to flow freely. I am broken and healed simultaneously.We all know how the story ends. Or, at least, where it ends when the last page of the Book is turned. Beyond that it is continued individually in our own lives and through our own daily choices and decisions, as lifelong witnesses to the sacrifice made for each and every one of us.Having held back from all the vapid discussions around water coolers and in neighborhood pubs previously, I'm glad now I can offer my own perspective. And that is: Gibson has courageously created a masterpiece. I would change nothing. I know the story so well, as many of us do, yet seeing it on screen so vividly left a powerful effect that haunts me still, days after seeing it, and perhaps lifelong. The entire movie is an invitation to explore one's heart, one's conscience, one's spirituality, one's life. It is a movie that changes lives.And is the violence gratuitous? I have heard so much about this-the violence of Christ's crucifixion. And I am offended by the accusation. How can our society be so hypocritical? In a time when we allow pornography on every venue, referring to this abuse of human rights and dignity as ""freedom of expression"", when we allow our children to play video games that glamorize murder, when every other movie on the screen today makes a sport of killing and torment, when child abuse has become rampant, and war rages across the planet.... we dare call a movie that realistically portrays the suffering one man, Son of God, endures for each and every one of us ... too violent? How dare we. I suspect it is our shame of the hammer and nail we each hold in our own hands that allows such rationalization.I highly recommend this movie.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A23FV2IRU37YYR	Z-man	Words fail to express the feeling this film created within me.  God loved us so much that He suffered and died for our sins.  We are all culpable in our Lord's death and without His suffering & death we have no eternal life.  Without His death on the cross, we have no resurrection and salvation. Is the film violent? Of course! Crucifixtion was violent and it's about time it was depicted as such.  I guess I never really understood what Christ did for us and I think many people including believers don't understand what He did for us. For those that ask where the love was in the film amidst the relentless brutality, I would say the entire premise is love.  Throughout His suffering He forgives and He took on the burden of our sins.  This film will make most believers stronger and I hope that it will turn many people to Christ.  He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life!  And the charge that the film is anti-semetic is garbage!  People that make that charge obviously don't understand the Gospel and the fact that Christ had to die.  His whole purpose was to fufill the law and die for our sins.  He was the Blood of the New Covenant and the sacrifice for us all so that all who believe in Him may have eternal life.  No one who is a true Christian would disagree with me.  The last thing anyone who sees this film will think is how it's Jews killing Christ!!  Absolute B.S.!!  Don't let the secular media sway you to not see this film.  It is life changing.

0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A2NA19XEOND5U8	Zordano	Like its source book, this movie is kitsch and schmaltz, the coarse and the crass - cloaked in imitation profundity.The Jesus figure is a man-made symbol of fatherly-brotherly altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. This myth is utilised to feed a mental loop of unfulfilled yearnings, guilt and shame.  So the movie is built on self-referring, primitive, goat-herder stories, wilfully mistaken for something meaningful.The movie's source book of primitive stories depicts fantasy figures called `Jesus' and `God' - invented by humans many centuries ago. It is purely and solely the drives of human culture and the products of neurological phenomena and obsessive thought-loops that produced the Bible. `God' is the product of neurological quirk, fused with ego-driven cultural obsession.To believe the movie's source book as the word of `God' is merely to fail to recognise its solely human sources: emotional, neurological, cognitive, cultural, sociological. Man's habitual self-deception and delusional, repetitive thought patterns generate religious belief. If a baby's fixation on the all-powerful, all-providing, all-knowing parent figure becomes mentally fixed - the result is rigid, fixated Christ and God-belief in adulthood.So given both its ancient and contemporary creative sources, it is no surprise then that this is a gaudy movie - a blunt instrument - lacking finesse and subtly. It is makes crude appeal to crude emotions and is vulgar in its execution.The Bible is bogus, spurious, and a garish concoction: a crude, blunt, vulgar appeal to amorphous concepts and broad-brush emotions and desires. For example: fear of death, the feeling of being lost and needing rescue, the psyche's desire for immortality, hunger for an upwardly directed relationship.Longings that merely end up as self-comfort mind-loops.If only this movie had been ignored - but it is just too difficult for people to break out of the neurological quirk that is religious belief, embedded and fused into culture as it most surely is. The movie is merely a contemporary manifestation of a relentless tradition of self-deception and delusion - of Bible-swill and God mush - and the desire to spread the mind washing cult-virus that is Christianity.Someone called `Jesus' might or might not have existed but - manifestly - he was not the `Son of God'. As such, this movie's core claim of `the Christ' is bogus and spurious.Humans wish to make sense of suffering. For some, `the Christ' on the Cross is a culturally potent man-made symbol of altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. Constructs of sin, fallen man etc all illustrate that Christianity is merely a fabricated construct employed by humankind/people to:- understand their own suffering- come to terms with their own suffering- justify suffering by the person(s) experiencing it- justify suffering by the person(s) inflicting itIf all of humankind were extinguished, so would 'Jesus' and 'God' - since this is their sole locus of existence. Truly it is manifest to all that: on the 7th day, man created God in his own image.Chances are that people who dislike this review will promptly generate ever more fierce and tight circles of belief thought-loops in order to dismiss it.At the foot of the end credits, we are accurately and truthfully informed that:&quot;Characters and events portrayed in this motion picture are fictitious.&quot;	1.0	A feeding frenzy for its viewers	2004-10-12	7	1	6

He did it not for Himself, but for you and me! He humbled Himself, and He came to the earth not to be served, but to serve and to save to world. No better example of what love is than Jesus Christ. Relgions offer lots of things, but Christ offers a relationship with God through His sacrifice. Nobody else in the history of the world has claimed to be God and proven it. He said He would be betrayed and killed and He was. But most significantly, He said he would rise again after three days, and He did! Jesus did many other things while He was on earth but if that in itself isn't enough to prove He is God's son, I don't know else can. John 10:10	5.0	This is what love is	2011-03-04	10	8	2
0310263662	The Passion of the Christ	A32BZLOLX0PLVD	zubby	Unlike other movies, the Passion of the Christ was not made to provide entertainment. It was made to inspire us. It was made to show us the very meaning of the true love that God has for us.  Few words are spoken - however the visual images tell the entire story. the silent suffering of our Lord and Savior is presented to us in the most dramatic and Biblically accurate way it could be. Watch this movie again and again, not the be entertained but rather to find your faith. Those without faith in the Gospel will reject this film as violent and meaningless gore, but those who believe will find the Passion to be the greatest movie they have ever seen because it vividly presents the most significant event in the history of mankind- the saving our eternal souls. the event had to be as violent as it was depicted because our sins are great. Jesus died to pay the penality for every sin committed by everyone who repents and confesses Him as Lord. The cost was very great and had to be depicted as it was, because it was done for you and me and everyone who believes in it. Watch the film and pray about its message, over and over again, every day.	5.0	The Passion will increase your faith	2004-09-03	4	1	3
